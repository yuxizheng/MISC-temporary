  "marriage is important for us, but you need to be honest with yourself and try to find the right person.",

  "it is really good to talk to you",
  "i understand. i was also in a pandeic. it can be scary when things don't go your way.",

  "you are welcome",
  "yes, there are. there's a lot more to life than just a relationship.",
  "are you able to go out with them?",
  "i suggest taking some deep breaths, which helps me concentrate on what i am doing presently, and focusing on the present minute, instead of the whole thing.",
  "i see. is there a way to avoid the cohworker's gossip?",
  "i think you can also take some courses that are free that you can access online and show them how you are doing in person.",
  "you'll find something soon! keep searching!",
  "if you feel alone just talk to your friends, that will help.",
  "i'm doing well. how are things with you?",
  "so you were sad about having a heart break, but that you still felt that you had a weird complex. is that correct?",
  "you can do it!",
  "it'll be okay. i am happy to hear that you are doing your best to find some peace during this time. it'd be great to talk about how you feel now.",

  "i can understand that. i also had a lot in common with your parents. it'll take time to learn to enjoy life and grow.",

  "i think it'd be best to avoid all of them.",
  "just remember, you are doing the right thing. you can do this!",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "i think that it could be helpful. i think it would be a good idea to start a marriage counsellor.",
  "you are welcome. i hope that things get better for you. i know that sometimes people just need to talk about something else and you can learn from that.",
  "you too!",
  "i think you can do it!",
  "it's a great way to talk about the pain. it'll help you to get over it.",
  "i can understand how you feel. sometimes we have to move on from a situation that we are not comfortable with.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, surgery can be so stressful, especially with covid involved.",
  "i can understand how upset you are, it is a very difficult situation to go through",
  "i am sure there are a lot of support groups out there!",
  "i know how you feel. i would also suggest talking to a therapist and getting a few sessions to help you process your emotions. you have to make the choice to move forward or move on.",
  "ah, that's a stressful time. what grade are you taking?",
  "i understand that feeling, especially when you are at home. what do you do when you feel stressed out?",

  "she has been in many companies",
  "i think if you have someone you can trust to talk to, maybe the uniball could help! i personally like the idea of making the alarm loud enough to keep me in my head and then having the other person know how to control it.",
  "why?",
  "i am so sorry to here that. how long ago?",
  "i know i'm in a bad spot with the cash flow issue, but i've found that sometimes just letting my own feelings out is more helpful than giving them a gift. i can't tell you how many times i'll tell my wife i love her, but she just doesn't seem to realize it.",
  "it sounds like you're doing the right thing by letting her know that you have a lot on your plate. is that correct?",
  "it's so hard when something like that happens. is there anything that i can help you with today?",
  "i've been there myself. it's really hard to stay away from family.",
  "so i hear you saying you are overwhelmed? is that correct?",
  "just from chatting with you, i can see how you are feeling. you are so dedicated to this task and i know you will overcome this.",
  "that is great to hear! i am glad i could help!",
  "have you talked to him about the way he talks?",
  "i am happy you have someone to talk to today. we all have our days.",
  "i would try to keep your head up and be open with them. you're not complaining. you are being honest.",
  "i understand. the pandemic has been a hard time for many of us. i have had to go through similar situations.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. is there any way you could connect with people online in person?",
  "have you tried contacting the people who take advantage?",
  "oh no, that sounds really bad. can you tell me more about it?",
  "yes, i think that is the case. it seems like everyone is focusing on the same thing.",
  "yes, and you can always learn to knit again. i know that was a great skill to have!",
  "you need to press charges against her, and then she will be able to sue you and give you a copy of your address.",
  "it is not about burden, it is about being honest with yourself. you're a strong person to be honest with, and i think that you'll find someone who will respect you for it.",
  "i can definitely see why it would be stressful! it'll be a tough year for you at this time of year. i am glad i could help!",
  "if there is nothing to do right now, i would look for a new job.",
  "that'll make things even more challenging. you are a strong person and i think you will be a great parent for doing that!",
  "i have found that being outside and taking walks is the most help me. but it's really hard to find the motivation to get outside now days.",
  "that's understandable. i know how difficult it is to be alone.",
  "yes, it is, i'm sorry to hear that. i can imagine how difficult that must be to deal with.",
  "no problem! have a great day!",
  "you'll do great! i wish you luck in the future!",
  "keep working and keep looking for a new job. you will find one soon.",
  "what are you looking for in a job?",
  "i used to do a lot of research online and i had a lot on how to deal with covid. i found that it helped me be more aware of what to do and how to control my body.",
  "i see. so they are being selfish and they do not want to be around you?",
  "i think it might be best to try and see them in a different light. sometimes we are just too focused on one goal, when we really mean the other.",
  "it sounds like you have a great idea of what your options are.",
  "i understand. i have had a lot of depression and i know how stressful that is.",
  "i understand that you are worried about your job loss, is there anything specific that is bothering you?",
  "i know how you feel. i was in the same boat. i learned that it is not about us. we are about ourselves.",
  "oh no, how are you feeling?",
  "maybe she has some sort of reason behind her actions. sometimes it takes some time to process things.",
  "you've already made a lot of progress! i think you'll be fine. i think it's a great thing to hear that you feel that you can handle both!",
  "i can provide you with some support.",
  "you too!",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "i understand that you feel that you are pushing him into the wrong direction.",
  "it'll be live, i hope! there are several online groups that you can join and you can talk to people who are going through the same thing.",
  "what is going on?",
  "i can understand that, sometimes it helps to get a reference.",
  "it is really sad when we feel rejected.",
  "i am very glad you encouraged me. have a wonderful day!",
  "i know you mentioned that, but try not to let it get to you. i believe that you can overcome this by taking some deep breaths.",
  "it'll take time. time to grow.",
  "i'm sorry to here about that. i would suggest reaching out to your boss or others in your position.",
  "is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "i think it is! it has helped me to cope with the current crisis.",
  "when did you break up?",
  "you can use the courage to find a new job, you will find a better one soon enough.",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "i am really sorry that you are going through this. this is the worst year to be in.",
  "yes, that is correct. it is very hard being stuck in a house.",
  "i can understand why you would feel upset, especially since you have had to lose a friend.",
  "that is true, maybe if your friends come over and you can sit down and talk it through with them and see if they can help",
  "i understand how you feel. sometimes it can be hard to find relief from the negative feelings.",
  "there are also research that show that a lot of people with cancer are suffering from seasonal fatigue. i wonder if that could help you.",
  "i understand, so what helped me is to talk to my friends and family. they can help me with my job search.",
  "yes, that is exactly right. i think it would be helpful to talk to you in person right now or later and let you know how much you need help. you are in the right path to healing and i hope your family can help you in the future.",
  "oh.. well, i see. that is a good start!",
  "hello, would you like to talk about your friend's situation?",
  "i feel you, i have felt anxious for months about things that have been going on",
  "that is really the only way to earn a license. i think you need to do a little bit more research on real estate before you can make any decisions.",
  "yes, but remember that this is a school day, so we can take pride in our work!",
  "that'll be a great way to focus on focusing on the moment and focusing on your focus on the rest of the day.",
  "okay, just tell them what they don't like about it",
  "goodnight!!",
  "how long have you been working in school?",
  "you too!",
  "you'd be a great laugh stock, but you'll need to make some distance first. you have to make sure you'r safe and know that you don't want to hurt her.",
  "you're welcome, and good luck with that. i hope you have a good rest of your day!",
  "that is really tough, i can understand that. what is it that you'd like to do?",
  "i'm glad you've been able to help me out today!",
  "oh no, i've been through that too. it's tough, but you can do it!",
  "what's going on?",
  "that's understandable. do you have any hobbies you enjoy doing?",
  "it'd be great to help you relax and get back into the routine.",
  "i understand, i was also in a group of people who were diagnosed with add. i also felt misunderstood by many others.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i know you are trying to make a good effort and i know how hard it is to get through this.",
  "you too. i hope to be in your shoes one day. it sounds like you are feeling a little better.",
  "i can see how it'd be a lot harder to get back into treatment. it'll take a lot of time.",
  "oh no! that is awful! i am sorry to hear that.",
  "i am also remote working.",
  "i've found writing helps me to keep motivated to write and not feel alone in thinking about how you feel.",
  "yes! it's so easy to think of the small steps but you are so motivated to make it big.",
  "i am good, what's on your mind?",
  "i've been having a bad time.. can you tell me more about it?",
  "sometimes we just need to talk and have a serious conversation",
  "i understand. i have been in the same situation. i know how stressful it can be.",
  "i can imagine that it's really difficult to make a big decision about when you'll be able to keep on keeping up with your assignments.",
  "i am so sorry that you are going through this. is there anything that you can do to try and help you?",
  "i see. i am sorry to hear that. so you feel that you are depressed and need help with your depression?",
  "i am so sorry to here about the breakup. it is really hard to get through something like that.",
  "i can understand that. it is very overwhelming right now. what are some ways to cope with it?",
  "i'd suggest talking to your son about it and asking him if he would be willing to listen to your concerns. sometimes parents just want to be there for their kids even when they're not, sometimes they don'tget it.",
  "you're very welcome! i hope things go well with you and your exes. i hope you can make the right choice and be happy with your relationship!",
  "how are you today?",
  "no problem! i hope things go well with you and i wish you the best in the future!",
  "i understand, sometimes it helps to talk to someone who can listen and be patient. i think you should try to talk more about the problems you are having.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. this is a tough time for many people.",
  "can you give me a few more details?",
  "hi, i'm sorry to hear that. how are you doing today?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. how are you feeling now?",
  "bye!",
  "i am here for you.",
  "i know it feels so hard to hear that. i can't imagine how you must feel.",
  "that is a very scary situation. i can understand why that would make you anxious. do you have any plans for the future?",
  "yes exactly! i am so glad that you asked!",
  "that's very true. have you thought about looking for a new position that will pay less than your current one?",
  "that'd be a good way to get some closure on the situation.",
  "if you are looking for a job, you could always look for a temporary one until the holidays.",
  "i think that would be a great start!",
  "i understand how you feel. i have been in a similar situation and i can tell you it does not always make you feel better to let it go.",
  "i'm doing good, thanks. what's on your mind today?",
  "that's good. you're a great partner to have around.",
  "just keep looking for jobs, you can do it",
  "i understand. i hope you are able to get some relief and comfort from this virus.",
  "i'll tell you what i'ts been doing.. i have to take this one day at a time, but it'll take some time for me to get over the stress of all of this, but i'l try to take pride in myself!",
  "that's awesome! i bet you're going to have a great time!",
  "what can i help you with today?",
  "it'll be ok",
  "it's been great talking to you!",
  "bye",
  "that sounds like a great plan!",
  "you are very welcome. i wish you all the best with everything going on.",
  "hello. how are you?",
  "that'll definitely make you feel less alone and relieved. i know that i have been feeling a bit alone lately, so i can't say that it's completely normal to feel that way, but you should know that you can do this!",
  "that sounds like a great idea! i think you can make it through this.",
  "that is a lot of pressure to put on yourself. have you tried talking to them about how you are feeling?",
  "what kind of things are you thinking about?",
  "i think you will be fine. i went through it and i am happy.",
  "i like rap and hip hop. what about you?",
  "well, you are not alone...",
  "just keep trying and you will find a job",
  "have you tried applying online?",
  "that is a really hard situation to be in.",
  "that's a great idea, i'm sure that will definitely help you.",
  "have you tried to talk to your friends or family about your situation and see if they can help you?",
  "oh no, you don t have the stuff yet! that is very sweet of her to have you.",
  "hello! how are you today?",
  "can you tell me more about the situation?",
  "i think that would be a frustrating situation to have to deal with. is there anyone in your family that you could talk to about this?",
  "that'll be hard. have you tried to talk with your cocoworkers? sometimes it helps to speak up for yourself and see why you're feeling anxious.",
  "i've been in a similar situation, and i can tell how lonely you are feeling. do you feel that you're being isolated?",
  "what do you think your future looks like?",
  "if you want, you can use your skills, and you can put your resumes out there and see what happens.",
  "yes, that is a good way to express your feelings. do you have a support system or therapist you can use to support yourself from home?",
  "i can see how that would be a difficult situation to face. i think that if you find yourself feeling embarrassed, you can always seek out a therapist or a counsellor.",
  "you're welcome.",
  "i think it'd be helpful to get some support from parents in the meantime.",
  "i've been tired. what is going on?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. do you know what you are feeling depressed about?",
  "i can understand that. it's hard to remember everything",
  "i'd suggest you talk to her about how she's behaving and tell her how you feel.",
  "well, that is unfortunate.",
  "have you tried to talk to your dad about this?",
  "i am not sure but you could try reaching out to a lawyer for help?",
  "you're welcome! i hope you'll feel better soon.",
  "that is understandable. you said you were working during the morning, so i'm assuming that you work at home and work in the evenings. does that sound right?",
  "bye",
  "oh no! that's awful! i'm sorry to here about that. i hope you're able to find a new companion soon!",
  "you are welcome, i hope everything works out for you!",
  "i hope i was able to help.",
  "do you have friends you can talk to about this sort of thing?",
  "it's been a really hard year for everyone. i've heard that the pandeworkers are trying really hard to prepare for it.",
  "i can relate to your situation, it can be very isolating. have you tried calling your friends and family and asking for help?",
  "i can understand that. we've been experiencing some difficulties in our mental health due to the pandemic. have you thought about talking to a professional about how to deal with it?",
  "try to sleep with your dog",
  "that's too bad. what do you think would make it better?",
  "that'd be a lot to handle, but you can do it!",
  "do you think you can get a better job online?",
  "thank you! yes, i know how you feel.",
  "no problem! i'll definitely look into it. i hope you have a great time with your daughter!",
  "have you tried to talk to a professional about it?",
  "i can feel your pain. i also had a friend who put me in trouble but he got the grade",
  "i think it is stressful to have two part timers. but it sounds like you are making some progress.",
  "oh wow, that is a lot of money to be made! i am really sorry to hear that.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i know how difficult that can be to deal with. i've been there, and i know it'll be hard.",
  "it's been a crazy year, but we've come to terms with it and hopefully things will get better for you!",
  "also, if you can't prepare, you will always be afraid to ask them to do anything you want to do. it will only make you feel anxious, and as you already said, you have confidence, and i think you are very intelligent and intelligent.",
  "it is really hard to see someone as a woman code when they are cheating on you. i think that is unfair of her.",
  "i am glad i could help you.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what do you think is the cause?",
  "i'm glad that you are taking the time to do those things.",
  "that is very honorable of you. have you spoken to any military personnel regarding your gun rights?",
  "that is great! i am glad you are having some time to yourself.",
  "i see, what do your friends do for work or school?",
  "it's been a rough year for sure.",
  "it'll be ok! you're going to do great! i think you'll do great too!",
  "what kind of things do you sell? i am working on some jewelry that is a little more interesting but not too big a deal.",
  "you too!",
  "it'll be okay. you can use that time to try and focus on things you enjoy.",
  "i am so sorry you had to go through that, but i understand it is hard to move on from a relationship when it is out of your control.",
  "you made a mistake?",
  "how may i help you today?",
  "i think it'd be helpful to talk to a counselor to make sure that you are able to communicate better with your wife.",
  "that's a good idea! do you think you could get an opinion from a therapist to see if you can find something that is free?",
  "i can understand that. it is hard to be so friendly and open with people. i would suggest talking to your friends and telling them what they did wrong. it will help you grow and change your friendships.",
  "that sounds very difficult, i can understand how that would make you upset.",
  "i have a lot of books on my wall that i can put away whenever i'm not working.",
  "that is not good, you should not be inviting your exes over.",
  "maybe it could be a bit of a fight?",
  "i am glad you are feeling better. have a great day!",
  "what is causing the anxiety?",
  "i am in the uk but i still have fun and we have lots of people here.",
  "is it worth it to you to wait until you find a job that is more suitable for your current position?",
  "merry christmas to you too!",
  "i would report at the start of shift. you deserve to get paid to work on time.",
  "i also have a hard time with those. i am also not very good at reading and meditating.",
  "thanks you too!",
  "you'll get through this!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i've been in a similar situation myself and i know how painful it must be.",
  "yes! there are many support groups for depression.",
  "i know that is hard to hear. i know you are feeling better now though.",
  "that's good to hear! i hope you can find something to help you feel better soon.",
  "perhaps you could offer a hybrid time off. it'll give you more flexibility in your job, and you can spend less time at home.",
  "i think it is important that you talk to your friend about the problem",
  "you two have a good relationship so i think you can work it through and have fun",
  "no, i have never been. but it does seem that traveling is a great way to meet new people and meet new ones.",
  "i am glad you feel better!",
  "what are some of your hobbies?",
  "i can understand how you are feeling.",
  "i would feel the same way.",
  "i can understand why you are angry but try to talk to your friends and tell them your feelings.",
  "i would definitely suggest a few minutes of meditation every night before sleeping. that will help you get a good rest.",
  "of course you can finish the chat.",
  "how can i help you today?",
  "yes. they're busy.",
  "yes, i can see how that would make you feel a little insecure",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. that must be devastating. how long were you together?",
  "i think that would be a good idea.",
  "i understand. can you tell me more about it?",
  "can you tell me what is wrong?",
  "you too!",
  "so you are feeling guilty about the things he has done. do you think you could try talking to him about it?",
  "i am doing well. thank you. what's the problem?",
  "well, i'm glad you've got a support system in place. they sound like really caring people. do you think they would be willing to listen to your advice?",
  "you are right, not all men are honest. sometimes we cannot control our own emotions.",
  "you've got this!",
  "you should talk to them about the way you are feeling, it will help you understand how you are going to be treated",
  "you too!!",
  "we all are working towards that goal... i can say we are working toward making ourselves more successful and i have to agree.",
  "i'll be ok, thank you for asking. is there anything you'd like to talk about today?",
  "that's really bad, and i'm sorry you had to go through this.",
  "that sounds very frustrating and frustrating. i would be afraid to leave the house and leave my family there. have you asked them to leave?",
  "i agree. i am sorry to hear that.",
  "that's good. my family are kind of the same way. it's always nice to have someone to talk to.",
  "you are very welcome. i hope the rest of your day goes well.",
  "i know how you feel. i can feel the stress and anxiety and fear.",
  "i used to do the same thing, i would have a good time in a few hours of the day, but i found it really helped to have a quiet night, and then a good day at the office.",
  "if you don't feel comfortable expressing your anger, what do you think would be a good solution?",
  "so you are feeling depressed and depressed?",
  "you are welcome! i hope i have helped you get through these tough times and i know that you will be able to do it!",
  "you are welcome. i hope i could help you a bit.",
  "i know it is difficult, but i think that you have your options right now. if you don'' t feel comfortable getting away from him, maybe you can try getting help from friends and family who are close to you and try to talk to them.",
  "i understand your dilemma. how do you feel about it?",
  "i think that you should be proud of your efforts and know that you can succeed.",
  "i hope that things will work out for you.",
  "oh my goodness!! that is definitely a problem that should be dealt with by someone else. do you think you could try and talk to a lawyer?",
  "it's okay to want to change. it'll be difficult, but i think that if you make it a point to change and make yourself feel better, you will be able to be a better friend for the rest of your life.",
  "just let him know that you need to get some counselling.",
  "i am sorry, i don't know that",
  "what i found was that when i failed the test, i took the other tests and took the test again and got a better grade.",
  "i talked to them about the issue and told them that it was making me feel bad. it helped a lot.",
  "i am good how are u",
  "i wish you all the best with it!",
  "there are some people who are trying to find a new job and it seems like you have a lot on your plate.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "so you're basically stuck there for 15 minutes, and it's supposed to be like a two hour conversation.",
  "when you tell them you are concerned, they will understand why.",
  "your welcome! thank you for talking!",
  "i think you should be able to reach them out through social media. you could talk to a counselor or someone with children's support.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. is there anything specific that you'd like to talk about?",
  "do you have anyone else that can help you with the financial side of things?",
  "good luck with your finals!",
  "i can see how that would be upsetting. i have had similar expectations in my life.",
  "i think that is a very good start.",
  "i would recommend looking for online work. i have found that the most helpful work is in person",
  "it has been a very long time for me. how do you feel about this?",
  "it took a year to remember your ex?",
  "you're welcome.",
  "it's great that you are trying to distract yourself. do you have any friends or family that you can talk to?",
  "i've been volunteering before and it'll help you feel better.",
  "that is a horrible idea. you are not obligated to move anywhere. i would suggest you call a lawyer and talk to them and see what they can do.",
  "hello how are you doing today?",
  "you can search for counselors in your area. they have counselors that will help you find a therapist that will be willing to help you.",
  "i've never tried anything like that but i do love to play fortnite, but i'd also recommend something like call of duty or call of duties.",
  "have you tried contacting the state board of health?",
  "it's true. it'll be hard, but it'd be a good thing to learn from it.",
  "have you been able to see anyone in the area?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, maybe they need a break from you?",
  "i am glad to hear that.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. have you tried to talk to your doctor about the situation?",
  "good luck with that!",
  "thanks.. i'm glad to hear it. i hope that we can talk about your situation and help you through it.",
  "i think it is a good idea to take your own time.",
  "that is really hard. did you try to talk to him about it?",
  "sounds like you've been applying for a lot of jobs, it sounds like it'll be a great time to get back into the game",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. it is very difficult when you are not working. do you have any other job at the moment?",
  "it is true that it can be frustrating to be broke and be working for someone else. i understand. i used to be a little broke myself.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. is there a particular reason you're feeling down?",
  "i am good thank you. how are you? can you tell me what is wrong?",
  "i can see how that would be a good way to make you feel better.",
  "you can always use that to make your case against them more positive, since they will most likely find out.",
  "i understand how you feel. i have had to take several classes to complete my school degree and it is hard.",
  "i can understand why it would make you sad. have you been able to talk to your coworkers about this?",
  "i think it is very important to talk about your feelings first and then try to get back in touch with someone who can help you.",
  "i understand that. it is not easy to lose your home but you can also borrow money and pay off the bills if you want.",
  "it'll take time, but i think you can do it!",
  "that'll make you feel better.",
  "i think it would be. i think you are capable of making the right decisions.",
  "i've been in a similar situation. it's hard but it will be okay.",
  "how are you?",
  "it is, i think that is a great idea.",
  "you have a good plan! i think it is a great thing to look at things from a different perspective.",
  "that's good, it is really helpful to talk to an admissions. you can try talking to them about your anxiety and how to deal with it",
  "i hope you find a way to enjoy the holidays!",
  "you are very welcome. i am proud of you for trying to get through this and make it through the day!",
  "what type of work did you lose?",
  "i am sorry to hear that.. i hope you are able to find a new job soon.. it is not easy.. but i believe in you.",
  "i am doing good thanks.",
  "have you looked into unemployment?",
  "that's a really tough spot to be in. i know how that feels. it is important to get through this alone.",
  "yes, i think you have a right to be frustrated, however, i would suggest talking to a professional to see what their opinion is on the matter and how to address it. you will find that it'll be much better for your mental health than what you've had to deal with.",
  "if they don'thing you are beautiful, it is understandable that they would be concerned about what other people think. you sound like a very supportive person who is able to express himself in a way that is positive. do you think that would make you feel more comfortable with yourself?",
  "i do not feel like i have any problems with the masks, i use them whenever i feel like wearing one. i do like them though.",
  "i am doing well. how are things with you? what is your problem?",
  "i see. have you tried talking to other couples about this issue?",
  "i think you should talk to your boss about your concerns and how to work things out. i know that i would be upset if my partner was working so much.",
  "i see. so they were just not being nice to you when you were supposed to be there but they were being mean to you?",
  "it'll probably continue to go on for longer, but at least you can talk to her about it and hopefully find a way to talk about it with her",
  "i am glad to hear that.",
  "i apologize, i don't know what happened",
  "i used to think it was my responsibility to do my job. i would only do my best and not let them control my life.",
  "i can imagine how hard it must be to be with that kind of reaction. i think that if you were to suggest that maybe she could go to therapy to help her come to terms with her feelings and problems and see if that would be an option for her.",
  "it was a pleasure to talk! i hope i can help you through this time!",
  "i can understand that. it's a difficult time, but it'll happen eventually.",
  "what would be the first step?",
  "that sounds very unfair. they should be supportive of your decision to break it up.",
  "just make sure that you are able to get unemployment from the company you work from.",
  "i think you can call unemployment and talk to them about the situation. i know its hard right now but there is a way to make it through it",
  "is there anything i can do to help?",
  "i hope everything goes well for you!",
  "i think talking to her is the right option. you deserve someone who cares about you, not someone who is being subtle. you'll find someone who does not care about you and will treat you with respect and respect.",
  "maybe that would be a great idea, i think you can do it!",
  "you are very welcome. i am happy to help. i hope you feel a bit better.",
  "that sounds like a great career choice.",
  "i've seen that happen before. alcohol consumption has really changed over time.",
  "i'm sure you will be a great fit",
  "you are welcome. i think you are being very supportive and i think that is a positive attitude to have.",
  "i understand. i would suggest looking for a job that will pay the bills.",
  "i feel you there. i've been feeling depressed and sad.",
  "i see, so you saw your chat history and thought you were chatting with someone else.",
  "zoom meetings can be a good way to talk to someone who is not being mean toward you",
  "i think it is important to do what is right for you.",
  "i hear you saying that you are doing all your efforts and that they don t call you half the times?",
  "you too!",
  "i was just going to wait for the vaccine but i decided to just wait until christmas. i was feeling down and depressed. are you feeling better?",
  "i think that is a good way to deal with the feelings of unresolved depression. do you have anyone who you can talk to about it with?",
  "no, i don't.",
  "yes, just press quit and take the survey.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what happened?",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "that would be a good start. you are in school and he is in college. he will probably be able to see you through text.",
  "i understand that. i am sorry to hear that. what are you doing to cope with this situation?",
  "maybe you should talk to your friends about the situation?",
  "that is very difficult. have you considered seeking unemployment?",
  "yes, i think it is important to not let this situation bring you down.",
  "i am glad to hear that, you have to put yourself first. i hope you are feeling a little better now.",
  "i see. well i think that you can do it! i am sure you will overcome this!",
  "i am good. do you have a specific problem?",
  "i can understand how you feel. i had similar situations at work.",
  "i think you will be able to finish your session. i believe in you.",
  "you are very welcome.",
  "do you think it was related to your coping with the loss? or was it more about the friendship they had with you? i know it can be difficult to figure things out.",
  "yes! as long as you set smaller goals. you could also try setting up more days to study, if that is easier.",
  "i am glad you are being optimistic. it is a very difficult time to come up with new solutions.",
  "it sounds like you are trying to make yourself happy, and it is good that you are taking time out of your busy schedule to enjoy your job. maybe you could go back to school or something and find a new job. sometimes it helps us to focus on our hobbyactivities.",
  "do you guys have any hobbies you enjoy doing together?",
  "i think that's a great way to focus. focusing on the news is very useful, and it's great to keep yourself focused.",
  "you are very welcome! have a great day!",
  "i think you should always prepare. i would do what you can to avoid the outcome.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i think you are being realistic in your expectations.",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "oh no! i am so sorry to hear that. that is a very difficult situation to be in right now.",
  "i'm glad you think so! you'll do great!",
  "you can go out for a walk if you want.",
  "hello! how are you today?",
  "i know it is difficult when you are in a situation like this, but i know you can do it.",
  "i think that is understandable. we need to keep trying new things to make things better, even if it's just a little.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what is the reason for concern?",
  "it'll take time. but you are going to be able to move on from this situation.",
  "well i hope that this conversation goes well for you : ) it is always good to talk about things with people who care about you.",
  "we are in georgia : ) what about you?",
  "hi, how are you today?",
  "it'll be better in the long run.",
  "i do not think so : ) but it'll be ok : ) i am from the uk",
  "that'll be a long drive, but at least you have some fun. i would take a nap or do something relaxing, or go for a walk or something.",
  "i've been doing well at the moment.",
  "ok. i am a male. i love to go out and do things with females.",
  "if you don't get laid off, i would suggest you go to a hiring agency and speak with your manager about the situation.",
  "it'll be okay. you have learned your lesson. you will find someone new",
  "you can share his time with him if you want.",
  "i can understand that completely. i have been in your shoes, and know how frustrating it can be to be stuck in a situation like that.",
  "try to get him to play games and share his time with you",
  "is he in a relationship where he'd wear underwear in public?",
  "i can understand that feeling. the only way you can find a better work is to make yourself a better fit. i think it would be a great thing to do for yourself and your family.",
  "what happened at your friend?",
  "you can't control the teacher's actions. they can'tlet you know what happened and you'll be able to succeed.",
  "you can reach out anytime you need someone to talk to. it will help to share your feelings with someone and you can make new friends.",
  "i think it is best to give time to yourself. you are both mature and can make a decision.",
  "have you spoken to him about it? i know how difficult it is to move on from a relationship without the support of others.",
  "so you have been unable to get out of the situation due to an unwarrable situation?",
  "i understand... i was a terrible piano player.. it was a very painful experience.",
  "oh, so you're having a bad season?",
  "i've been there before, but i think you'll be okay. it's normal to feel overwhelmed right now. do you have any specific issues you're having?",
  "i think it would be a great start. i believe you should be able to avoid harassing them and continue to harasses them. i am sure that you have made the right decision.",
  "do you know that some of the things you can do to help yourself to overcome the difficulty of covid is to get yourself through it, or to build on what you have already done?",
  "i completely understand what you are saying. have you tried searching online for employment through unemployment?",
  "what about a family member, a friend, family member?",
  "i can tell that you have put in a lot of work and are frustrated. is that what you are feeling right now?",
  "you as well!",
  "you are not worth anything. they are not worthy of your time. you are a valuable person. you can spend time with yourself, take care of yourself, and get to know others.",
  "i think that is the right attitude for you. maybe you can talk to your friend about your anxiety and depression.",
  "sleep is hard and you should try to meditate or do yoga you can feel your mind relax and relax",
  "bye!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. is there something that i can help with today?",
  "i have an extra year before my son's graduation - so it's been a bit of a challenge for me. i've learned a lot about economics and i feel more comfortable with my degree!",
  "have you considered looking online? there are a lot of opportunities for online work.",
  "i would suggest taking a look at a few online jobs to see if you can find something you like. you can also try using a friend's computer to try and search for jobs online and see if they have any in their field.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "yes, it does.. i'll make a list of things that are helpful and you can think of ways to get out of that rut.",

  "how are you doing today?",
  "i think if you are afraid she will fail you then you could ask your teacher for extensions",
  "i am glad to hear it! take care!",
  "hi there, how are you doing?",
  "youre welcome and i hope it helps you",
  "yes i do. i've seen a lot of movies where people would talk about their friendship and then talk about how they feel. i think you'd be surprised at how much you can do with those feelings.",
  "i did have fun. my first wedding was a surprise for my friend and i. i felt so much better afterwards.",
  "no, i think it is more of a mental health issue. you don't want to be in a bad mood and get tired, so you are probably depressed.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i think biking and biking is a great way to get around. i have a little bit of experience riding a motorcycle myself. it's a great exercise! )",

  "have you tried to talk to him about this?",
  "i've seen people who seem to have this problem before. is that a common issue with people who are not as fortunate as you?",
  "well, if you really like your job, you can find a job. i would suggest looking for a job that you can be in, and then applying for them.",
  "i would be afraid to press it. it can be very difficult to do so. i'd suggest that you talk to him calmly and explain your feelings, and how you feel, and why you feel that way.",
  "you should give some more time to yourself",
  "no problem, have a great day.",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. it sounds like you have a lot of options now. do you have any family or friends in your family who could help with hiring?",
  "i know it's been hard but i think you can find something. have you tried looking online?",

  "have you tried talking to him in a different way?",
  "you too.",
  "of course! i hope you feel better soon.",

  "i am sorry to hear that. what is the cause of your sadness?",
  "that's a great idea! i think that would make a lot of difference. i also like to listen to relaxing music that helps me to clear my head.",
  "that'll be hard to handle when the holiday season is on. is there anyone else in your department who can help with that?",
  "i'm not sure, i've never had a relationship with someone before. however, i know it can be difficult to get them to like you. i think it would be best to ask him to stop thinking about you, even if that is the case.",
  "i can understand how you feel. i have been in those situations before.",
  "it sounds like you are going through a rough time. have you thought about moving on?",
  "have you gone to any friends or family that you can talk to about this issue?",

  "i'd suggest you let her know how much you care about your friend and how you feel about her.",
  "absolutely. there are some people who don'; t know what to say about that, so they'll just have to do their best to make sure that there's nothing wrong with their friendship.",
  "i know that it is hard to find good support online these days.",

  "hello, i am here.",
  "what type of work did you do?",
  "i can see that. it is difficult to get a grade slip when you are only getting a a'' s and a'd's. do you think you are trying to be positive?",
  "i like to play call of duty, but that is just my opinion. what do you like to do in your free time?",
  "i understand. you are feeling comfortable enough to share your feelings with them.",
  "no, but you could try reaching out to some friends and asking what they think about this.",
  "do you know what color she thinks she will want to get?",
  "i have a degree in computer engineering. i have been in a few of these fields, and it is difficult at times to find work.",

  "i understand that. i have had a dog before. it is good that you reached out to get help from a friend to get a new one.",
  "i can understand your concerns. i am also concerned about the future and well being of my son. it is difficult when the people around you who care about you feel the need to help.",
  "it'll be okay, we all have bad days. it is all about learning from ourselves, and that is a great skill to have.",
  "you are welcome, good luck.",
  "of course. what kind of job are you looking for?",
  "what about your friend?",

  "yes, i'm an artist and i've been doing online work for several months.",
  "that is frustrating. i would be upset too.",
  "i am not a great typing person but i do understand how stressful it can be to be out of touch with others. i had a lot of trouble finding work in the past due to covid, but i have been able to get through it in time and it helps me understand how much more important my job is than others.",
  "i understand how you feel. i went through a breakup once and it was really tough. but i think you can do this!",
  "that is a really hard situation to go through. what did you do to get through it?",
  "i think you should try to focus on the positives rather than the negatives. maybe the positive memories of the night will help you get over this breakup.",
  "oh wow, six kids. that's an awesome amount of kids.",
  "i know it'll be hard but i think it'd be worth it.",
  "it sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders, and are making the most of the effort to get through this.",
  "you too! i hope you feel better soon.",
  "i see. so you feel as though you can't control what happens?",

  "i am sorry to hear that. what makes you feel helpless?",
  "what type of food did you serve?",
  "i like it a lot. i have had some really good conversations with a friend that i trust.",
  "i can see you are feeling stressed and angry about this.",
  "well, i'd suggest not using a knife to disarm them as they might be able to see you as a danger to yourself or others. i think that you can use a gun to protect yourself or your family and your kids from harm, but i'll let you know that you're not alone.",
  "that sounds like a great way to spend some time with them. what are your favorites to do with your time? i love to read, play video games, play a game, or watch movies \"",

  "i've been there. you are a very strong person and you will be successful!",
  "i am glad to hear that. i hope this helps you to find some additional income and appreciate from your families.",
  "do you have any other interests that you enjoy?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what made you feel this way?",
  "how may i help you today?",
  "i'm glad to hear it. what kind of things are you planning on doing in the next year?",
  "is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "i hear you on that. i was with my girlfriend for 9 weeks before she left me. i know how you feel.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "it was well thank you, how may i help?",
  "he's honest. you said you're not happy with the way he treats you and you don'thing he'd treat you differently if she were out the pic.",
  "that's a really hard situation to be in.",

  "i do not know any but you can try to find a job online.",
  "it sounds like you are doing a good job keeping yourself motivated. i think it is important to take care of yourself first, then focus on making sure you are working hard for your grades. i would say, if it seems short and overwhelming, then maybe it is the right thing to do.",
  "i am happy to help you through this difficult time.",
  "let him know that he can not trust you, but he can help you in anyway he can",
  "that is understandable. i am in a very rural area.",
  "what kind of work is there?",
  "i think that'll be the case for everyone. there are some things out here that are cheap, but it is so hard to find them when you don'; t have them around.",
  "i understand that, it's hard to hear people say they are so much better than they actually are. i think you should try to stay positive and take care of yourself and try to focus on what is important to you and your family.",
  "i'd say take a deep breath and get some deep breaths. you can't just look back at the past and see how sad you were. we all make mistakes, but if you really want to try to heal the pain, you can find a way to move on from this situation. it will only make you stronger.",
  "i can tell you are a strong person, and your life is very well suited to you and i applaud you for taking the time to learn how to get out of a funk",
  "it'll be okay. i've been there myself.",
  "no problem. it is hard to learn new things, but you can press quit and take the survey.",
  "that'll definitely help!",
  "it sounds like you are a good listener and have a good heart.",
  "yes! i think getting a haircut is the best! and it's so easy to forget about what was so great about us!",
  "it sounds like you are doing a great job at what you do.",
  "so you are not able to see your brother anymore?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what is making you sad?",
  "do you have family to talk to about your covid issue?",
  "sometimes we have to make ourselves known in order to be invited",
  "when you're ready to move on, it will be easier for you to see things from your perspective.",
  "you are welcome! i hope you find something in the future!",
  "have you tried to go to a restaurant or something similar to meet people there?",
  "there are plenty of online recruiting sites that will work with your area. i know that there are a few on linkedin.",

  "you are welcome.",
  "that is a great idea!",
  "i used to make chex chips with honey and honey toast! they're so good!",
  "i agree. we have to stay distracted with our own kids. it seems like the world is going crazy right now. we should take a break for a while, and find a new hobby or something. maybe a new movie or something to go out with friends and family?",
  "you've already taken a step forward by reaching out to other people and finding a new partner. you have your first step and it will take time, but you will be successful.",
  "i understand that it's a tough major for biology, but i'm glad you have the opportunity to be a biology major.",
  "hello how are you doing?",
  "you've got this!",
  "i've been writing down why i feel the way i do and how i want to express it. i'll be happy to listen to you as to why i think you feel this way.",
  "that's true. people are supposed to be kind to each other, but i'd say most people are just trying their best.",
  "i do not but i do have a gym nearby. i would suggest doing a walk in the park or outside and getting some fresh air.",
  "i think it is a great idea. it shows how open you are with your feelings.",
  "i can't right now due to the pandemic. can you tell me what you are having trouble with?",
  "so u have a partner fighting with u and he is fighting with you?",
  "you are loving him because you like him.",
  "it is important to take care of yourself and your health first before trying to do something else.",
  "it'll take time, but you can do it!",
  "i understand that, i used to drink too much to quit and it was hard on my brain. it is important to find a way to stop, do things with your own body and your mind.",
  "hello! how are you today?",
  "it'll be great that you've found someone to talk to about it. it sounds like you'll definitely be able to find a new therapist if you find one that fits your needs.",
  "i'm doing good, how can i help you? do you want to talk about anything else?",
  "i see. do you have a friend or family member who can support you through this?",
  "please let me know if i can help you.",
  "you have to be there for yourself",
  "exams are so hard. i've been there myself. it's been hard when you can'' t do anything with your studies. what are you studying?",
  "i understand that, your parents should not know",
  "you don't want to lose sleep because you have an unhealthy body. you want to keep your mind healthy. if there's nothing you could do about this, you would have to make yourself miserable. you have no control over it. you are not alone.",
  "hi there! how are you today?",
  "oh my goodness! i have had to learn sign language over the years. it is extremely difficult to learn. i would suggest that you seek professional help.",
  "that is a hard thing to hear. do you have a lot of other friends who share your same beliefs as you?",
  "i can understand how that would cause you to feel helpless. do you have any friends or family that you can talk to about it?",
  "so you feel that your boss is not listening to you?",
  "that is good. i hope things start to improve for you. i think you will be able to get through this.",
  "what is happening there?",
  "i see. is this the first test you have taken?",
  "it sounds like you are struggling with your school and your parents are not sure if they can help you. what are your plans for the future?",
  "if you are able to find a job with a similar path, maybe you could explore some of your other options and see if you feel that you can get a better job with less covid.",
  "i mean a person who works with you in a group",
  "that sounds really difficult. how long have you been friends with her?",
  "it can be, but just because you don't dance doesn't mean you don t have a chance to meet people..",
  "that'll be a great way to save some money. i hope you'll feel better soon!",
  "bye",
  "so you are a christian?",
  "i know it is so hard when you feel trapped in a situation that has been going on for so long. do you have any other family or friends that you can talk to about it?",

  "i can see how that would be hard for you. i would suggest reaching out for help if you can.",
  "do you have any family members you can talk to about this?",
  "it sounds like you are feeling isolated and it is very hard to let go of those feelings.",
  "it sounds like you are not being ignored, but rather she is not able to see you.",
  "hi there, how are you feeling?",
  "you're welcome. you can use this time to find yourself a support group for your family.",
  "i am happy to be here.",
  "i understand that. i am also in a very similar situation. i have had to speak to my supervisor a few times. he is very supportive, but also does not always have the best intentions.",
  "that'd make sense. is there any way you can talk to your boss about this with him?",
  "i am glad to hear that. i love to walk too. i have always wanted to be outside, but i had to leave my home when it was 60 degrees. i did enjoy the fresh air and the fresh water. i hope you feel better after the vaccine!",
  "hey there, how are you today?",
  "i hear you on that. i also use to play the instruments myself. i tried to make my friends who were close to me go out and play instruments together. sometimes it helps to get to know each other.",
  "oh no, i can understand why that would make you feel sad. do you have anyone to talk about it with?",

  "so you are both in a relationship with someone else?",
  "yes, they are. but it can be a good start.",
  "i understand that. have you thought about talking to someone about this?",
  "i had a break up in the past. it hurt for a long time.",
  "i understand, sometimes the best way to take things back is to talk with him and let him know that you do not think it is right.",
  "oh i see. i am sure you can find something in your area. i know that many people are working from home right now.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, do you think that it is possible that your school has some sort of warning for the coming finals?",
  "that's really good. i hope that helps you a lot.",
  "i can see how that would be frustrating. have you tried to talk to a supervisor about it?",
  "it does take time, but it is a lot! i'd like to say it'll be nice to be able to borrow some money to pay off my student loans, but i can see that being really difficult to do while you are looking.",
  "hello! how are you doing today?",
  "it's good to have someone to talk to about it. i know that sometimes it can be helpful to speak with someone who can help you.",

  "that's understandable. i think it'd be better if you didn't have that conversation with them though.",
  "it's been so long since i've had a relationship with someone, i can tell how much it hurts to be reminded of them",
  "yes i am a real one, i have been trying to get to work and i can feel myself getting better",
  "that's really tough. have you tried doing some online yoga, like yoga with a friend?",
  "that's great! i'd definitely be willing to listen to some of your suggestions if you're willing to give them a try!",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "bye",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, what's going on?",
  "yes, it's great that you are taking online courses.",
  "that is understandable, but it is a very difficult situation to be in.",
  "i can relate to that. i am in school and i have had the same thing happen before.",
  "i think it'll be okay. just make sure to be more proactive than to let everyone know you are great at the job!",
  "i can understand that it is hard to deal with people like that when they are treating you badly.",
  "maybe you could try to tell them you are frustrated with the situation and would like to talk about what happened?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. is there any way you can get some support from your doctor?",
  "i see, i would imagine that it would be very scary for you to be in a lock. i would worry too.",
  "i would recommend doing those first to get more information on what type of work you can find. you can also check with your state and local unemployment office. i believe they might be able too.",
  "i have a lot of work to do before christmas, so i can relate.",
  "can you explain more about the situation?",
  "it sounds like you are dealing with a lot of stress right now. do you think it is possible to seek professional help to reframe your situation?",
  "i hope that this conversation helps you to get through this difficult time.",
  "that is a good idea. therapy is very helpful in finding someone who can help you both.",
  "i can understand why that would make you feel jealous.",
  "yes, i visit them at least once a week. do your best to make sure you don't fail your class.",
  "it's very important to understand that you have a right to your current position.",
  "ah i'm sorry to hear that. what's going on?",
  "so you feel that you are being manipulated and that you have nothing to hide?",
  "it has been cold here too. but i think that some people are just not getting the chance to do things with their kids.",
  "maybe you should try to go to a movie or a book club to get some new ideas",
  "it's great that you moved to the new school. i have a friend who lives at home and is in college.",
  "do you feel like you can help him out a bit?",
  "i think it might be best to seek some professional help, but i am sure there are plenty out there.",

  "bye",
  "do you have any family in the us that you can talk to?",
  "i think it's understandable that you feel that way. it'll be hard to get over something that's happened so recently.",
  "i have had it since i was in highschool. it'll take a while, but if it happens again, i'd recommend trying to find a new playlist to listen to before bed.",
  "we don'' t need to worry about dying or dying, we just need to be able to get out and do something else. it's a blessing and a curse to our mental health.",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "i think you have the right idea. it's not the gossip that matters. the fact that you can approach him and let him know how you feel is a great step in the right direction.",

  "i think you should try to smile and let others know you are feeling confident.",
  "i hope that you can find some peace and happiness, and that things will be better soon.",
  "is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "it's not drugs that make us sad, it'd be the people we love and our family.",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. i have felt that way myself in the past. are you able to talk to anyone about your issues?",
  "i understand. i had a similar situation, and it was very difficult to find something in order to get through school.",
  "i am glad that you are taking steps to help with this. i think you have found the right path to take. you are doing your best.",

  "hello, how are you?",
  "you are welcome. i hope you have a great rest of your day.",
  "well, if they don't care, maybe they don t like you, and they do not want to see you.",
  "i think you should be able to find another counseller if you feel like it'll help. maybe you could also get a tutor to help with your homework as well.",
  "it seems that your situation is more than likely due to the pandemic and not just the financial situation.",

  "yes, he would. i am glad that you stood up for yourself. i would not want to be in a relationship with someone that i wasn't happy with.",
  "it is very difficult to feel worthless in a sense that you are not worthy of love. do you have any other family members that you can talk to about this?",
  "what type of work are you interested in?",
  "religious groups are a great idea, you should look into it.",
  "i am happy to help! i hope that you will find something soon, i know how hard it is to find a job right now.",
  "that sounds like it could be a reflection on both of them, does that sound accurate?",
  "it is. what are you doing to cope?",
  "i hope you two can connect emotionally and can get through this.",
  "yes, and we all make mistakes and god is the one responsible for making those mistakes. we should take care of ourselves and not let him ruin it for us.",

  "i think you'll find that the support you need is extremely helpful.",
  "i hope you guys can come to a mutual agreement! i know how difficult it is to lose someone, but i am sure you will be successful!",
  "i would suggest doing this in a more calm setting, but even then i wouldnt do it until you were ready to leave, honestly. if you have a friend or family member who you can confide in, and you are in a relationship with, you will be able to be more comfortable with them. if not, i would recommend getting a professional opinion on what would be a good idea to do.",
  "that is rough. i know that can be very difficult.",
  "what would be something to try and get you back on your feet and help you cope?",
  "i've heard that the more time you spend with your children, the more you can spend with them. do you think that might help?",

  "i'm sure that it'll be good to keep up with the news, given that it is a daily news outlet.",

  "what's going on?",
  "i can understand your frustration. it's really hard to come out from that.",
  "i can relate to that. i have been in a similar situation.",
  "i think the best way to decompresse is to start doing things that make you happy.",
