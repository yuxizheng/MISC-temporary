  "it'll be okay, i know you can do it.",
  "hello. how are you doing today?",
  "i wish you all the best!",

  "i am glad to hear that. is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "i can imagine it is. i can only imagine how long it must have been for you to get through all of this. do you have any family or friends to talk to?",
  "i am glad i could be of help.",
  "i am from new england",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "i'm sorry that happened to you. i think that it'd be wise to be able to speak to someone about this.",

  "that'll be tough, but it'll make you feel better!",
  "is there anything specific that you want to talk about?",

  "it'll be a long time before we learn anything.",
  "do you have any friends in the family who you can talk to?",
  "i completely understand. i have been in a similar situation and i have found that the grass has been pretty dark and i can't really feel any joy or relief from it. i feel like i have to do nothing at all to keep my mind off things or my job. i just try to focus on the things that i can control and enjoy.",

  "i understand that. it is good to have an opportunity to get a new job though",
  "i can understand that. what happen dear? how did this happen?",

  "i know that this pandemic has made things very difficult for many.",
  "i can understand that. i had a similar situation a few months ago and it was very difficult.",
  "i understand how you feel.",
  "you as well!",
  "i would just focus on your own feelings and let them be their own. you are right that you are not worth the friendship anymore. but if you are truly feeling isolated and would like to spend time with others, maybe it is time to start focusing on yourself and your self. i hope this has helped.",
  "yes, i think that's a good thing!",
  "you can try to take a nap or take a walk, it will help you to relax",
  "bye",

  "i am sure you are trying to help.",
  "oh no i can understand your feelings on that. you are not alone in that.",
  "yes, i understand. but i can tell that you are not alone. you need to look for help from your family. and if you are struggling to find help, you need help from others.",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "i can see how you feel that she is mean. i would ask for extension, but you should ask for a grade that is not as high as what you normally get.",
  "good luck to you as well!",
  "hello there, how are you doing today?",
  "you've got this, just talk to each other and see what you can do to make things better",
  "maybe you could invite them for a coffee or something, then go for a walk.",
  "oh weddings can be a fun time, but i don t think it'll be for you. you have to get to spend time with them and take care of yourself.",
  "it could be both! do you think you might be stressed about not being able to sleep as well as you want to?",

  "well, you want to be able to make a career out of it.",
  "i can see how that would make you feel that way. i'd have to agree with you on that. i personally would ask him to not press the subject, but maybe just explain to him how he'd like to express himself to him that his job is being taken away from him.",
  "what did she say to you",
  "no problem.",
  "i know it can be difficult to find something, but i think you can do it!",
  "what sort of work do you have in mind?",
  "i'm doing well, thank you. how can i help you today?",
  "if it'd be possible for you to work things through with her, then i think it would.",
  "i've felt this way before, and i'd suggest you look in to that.",
  "i would recommend starting with a local car store or a local community center. there are free grocery stores and you can get a good deal on stuff like grocery stores, grocery stores or grocery stores that can sell motorcycles and motorcycles.",
  "is there anything specific that you would like to discuss with me about?",
  "oh okay, well, i hope you are able to get some support from your grandson. i know how difficult that can be.",

  "you are welcome!",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "i see, i am also in a similar situation. i have not been able to afford to buy anything at the moment because of the pandemic.",
  "i can understand that. i have had to do this myself before and it was extremely difficult.",
  "i think it might be helpful to look into some classes that you are interested in and try to find some classes you are looking at that are both more expensive and more useful.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that, that must be really hard.",
  "that is a very difficult situation to be in, i've been in it myself. i know how stressing and anxious you can feel.",

  "i hear you, i am also struggling to fall asleep but i try to stay focused and keep my mind on the task at hand.",
  "what would be a good start? i know it can be hard to get back into your old old job.",
  "have you thought about finding a new hobby? maybe even a new job?",

  "i can understand how you feel. i have had to deal with the same issue.",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "i am sure you will be able to find something soon.",

  "i am sorry to hear that. i am sure you are feeling pretty down. how are you?",
  "yes, i have tried a lot of things. i have had to take one day at a time to get through a rough patch of depression and it has really helped me. i also have found that reading, or listening to music, can be helpful.",
  "that sounds difficult. i'm sorry you've been in this position.",
  "i think that it'd be a good idea to take the time to make things back to where they were before you two broke up. you both need to be honest and not judge each other. if he does not want to spend the time he has now, then you may as well just ask him to do something you both like.",
  "do you have a study group?",
  "i know how you feel. i have been in a similar situation.",
  "what is causing you to be so stressed?",
  "i'd like to chat, but i can't see your messages from here. have you tried talking to him yet?",

  "that sounds like a great idea. i think that is a good start.",
  "i understand. losing a loved one can be difficult. what i have found is that talking to people who have gone through the same thing as you can help. i have felt a bit of relief by talking to someone who has been there for me.",
  "i find it helpful to search for new information. sometimes i find a local news group.",
  "i am so sorry to hearing that..",
  "yes, i think it would be a good thing.",

  "if they're getting tired of your work, maybe you can ask your manager if they would like to talk to him.",
  "have you had to talk with them in the last few months? sometimes it helps to talk through things and see if they truly care about you and your feelings.",

  "of course! i wish you all the best.",
  "is there any way for you to communicate with him via text or video call?",

  "maybe you can take them for a walk or go for a run.",
  "i understand that, i have had people who were having mental health issues who were able to keep their jobs. i understand how difficult that must be, but it's also a step in the right direction. i would recommend that you look into talking to someone you trust in the future, someone who has experienced the same type of issues as you and who is able to get help for her.",

  "yes, that's a good thing.",
  "thank you so much! you too!",

  "i completely understand what you are going through. i went through that too.",
  "you can ask me that.",
  "perhaps you could consider looking for other positions that you might be interested in. there are also several websites that offer gig work. perhaps looking into gig work might help you find something that would allow you to get your work done sooner.",
  "i can see how that would make you feel anxious.",
  "have you tried reaching out to them and telling them what is going on?",
  "i can understand your frustration, but i think that you can do it!",

  "what have you seen in the past?",
  "you are very welcome. i am glad to help.",
  "hi. i'm so sorry to hear that. would you like to talk about it?",
  "i think it's just a matter of time, not necessarily a long term thing, but just a normal thing to happen. and i think if he's working, he'll probably find someone else too.",

  "i am sure that your dad has given you plenty of time to look back on his own progress.",
  "no problem. glad i could help.",
  "i hear you! i know it can be very stressful when you are in a cold weather but i have found deep breathing helps me get out of my funk and relax.",
  "i can relate to that! especially since it'll be a long year. i live in a rural area, so i'm not sure if it'd be fun to be in the city.",
  "i'm doing well. i've been having a hard time with work. how is life treating you? are you feeling a little better?",

  "i hope it all works out for you. you deserve to be happy.",
  "you are welcome. i hope i have been able to be of some assistance.",
  "i understand. i also am not allowed to go to social events because i am scared of going out. i have found that going out helps me get away from my depression.",
  "painting can be a great way to reenergize and relax.",
  "maybe try to make it a point to not be afraid to take a step back and look at what you've learned and that's what your family will value.",
  "that is understandable. you are right, it's a big deal to not be able to be close to your loved ones.",
  "that's rough, i'm sorry to hear. are you still able to talk to someone?",
  "oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i've lost a job too and i know how hard that is.",

  "that'll be part of being a student. you're not alone!",
  "yes, it is the right thing to do.",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "i am in my 60s and i have found that people are more self aware than they think.",

  "yeah, i am sure that you will have a great time!",
  "i'd say that you are not alone in this feeling. i think you are going to find someone eventually. you can do it!",

  "i have been planning a new year and trying to get back into the fresh air and outdoor activity that makes me feel better.",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "i completely understand. i am in the same boat as you. it's a long drive to see my family. i still live alone, so it'd be nice to be somewhere outside of the city.",

  "it's good that you are open to talking to someone about this. you can get professional help and it'll take a lot of time to get through this.",
  "i have had to deal with a lot of issues with my friends, so i can relate to how you are feeling. i know how you feel. i would suggest reaching out to someone in your group to talk to and then seeing if they have any ideas on how to help you.",
  "i am sorry i meant town hall, i am not sure",

  "i understand that, i've had a similar situation and i can definitely relate to how you are feeling.",
  "that makes sense, but i think you have a legitimate reason to be anxious.",
  "i can see that... i was thinking the same thing. i think it is a good thing that your friend is wearing a tie. i am sure his real life situation has been better than some of the things he has put on his resumes.",
  "i think you are in the right.",
  "it's hard for me to see people else in my life taking advantage of me, but it'll be worth it. i'm sure you will be able to find some relief.",
  "have you tried any food banks?",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. i have been in the same situation, and it was really scary.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i would recommend moving on if you can!",

  "you can try looking at this as a stepping stone for yourself. i think that would be a great start.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you been feeling this way?",
  "so you don't have any reason to think this is about you",
  "do you think you are being unfair?",
  "i understand how that can be hard to do.",
  "is it the same professor?",
  "i think you have a good head on your shoulders and that is great that you are trying your best to make a positive impact.",
  "you may also want to consider taking some time away from him and taking some small breaks from work. maybe you can take a few minutes to yourself and talk to your friends and family about how you are feeling. this may help him get over his depression. is this something they would be willing to discuss?",

  "bye",
  "yes, you can also learn to write in another language.",
