  "oh no! i am so sorry to here that! it must be difficult.",
  "i know you've been feeling stressed out by your mum.",

  "wow, i can see how that is troubling you right now.",
  "it'll be nice to have someone to talk to and be with.",
  "it'll take a little time, but you can!",
  "i think that is the right call. it would be a terrible thing to not speak with the cops though, especially if they have no idea what happened.",
  "i think that you are trying to find the right fit for your partner. you have to be patient and take your time.",
  "wow, that sounds really interesting! i would definitely recommend avoiding academic probation for now, you will feel better after graduation!",

  "you too!",
  "hello! how are you doing today?",
  "do you think that he might be pushing you to do something wrong?",
  "i do not. i am not sure if there is a club that does. i know that there is an app called zoom for your phone that i use. i just use my phone to talk to people online.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. why is that?",
  "have you tried looking online? there are some online jobs that you can apply for",
  "what kind of job do you want?",
  "yes, you have. i can recommend a few things i can think of if you would like.",
  "i can relate to that. i have been there too. i think this pandemics is the worst case senario. we don'' t want to have anything to do with it. we've become too afraid to do anything about it.",
  "have you ever tried to speak to anyone about the panicking?",
  "that is true. maybe try and see if there is a union around you that can help. or maybe you could try looking for a new job.",
  "okay, so i've been thinking about a couple things that might be helpful to you. one thing that i'll recommend is to not give up on yourself. i think you're doing great.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "ok",
  "i think you should take up yoga and try to stay calm and keep yourself occupied.",
  "you're welcome, i hope you have some good luck.",
  "i can relate to that. i have been through this myself and know how painful it is to be dumped. i know you are going to be able to find someone wonderful and fulfilling.",
  "i understand, that is a very difficult situation. what do you like to do for fun?",
  "i can understand that. i went through a similar situation. i did try to talk to my best friends about it. i was able to get through it though",
  "yes, if you have no evidence then you can take them.",
  "i think it is great that you are willing to seek help and support.",
  "i think if you do that you should be able to find out",
  "i can understand. i have been in a similar situation. i had to start looking online and searching for jobs online. i found a few places that offered me the job. i tried searching locally and looking for a job in the local area, and it worked out!",
  "yeah exactly. you can talk whenever you want.",
  "oh! i am sorry. i thought you were talking about sleeping. i would suggest looking into some meditation apps that you might be able to find on your computer.",
  "hello",
  "i can understand. it is scary. i have been worried about the pandeic as well. i think it will only get worse for everyone and there will be a lot more concern over the next year.",
  "that is a great idea! i would definitely consider learning a loan or a real estate license. i also have heard that they offer some free classes, too.",
  "i know how stressful it can be, but it also helps to remember that you have been studying and doing your best.",
  "you're welcome! i'd also love to know how much you've been trying to find ways to relax and focus your mind.",
  "i understand that you are angry but that is not the problem",
  "bye",
  "is there anything else that would help?",
  "you too!",
  "i think that the best thing to do is to sit down and have a talk with someone and see how things are going.",
  "i think that'll be a good idea. do you have any friends that you can talk to about your health?",
  "i'd say just keep trying, it might not be a final exam but you should try, you really can't go wrong with that!",
  "i think you should. it's good to have support from others.",
  "oh no, that's so hard. i've been there, too.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i have been depressed too. it seems like everyone is.",
  "i've had a similar situation before and it is hard but i'll be patient. i hope you are able to find a support group that can help you and your children.",
  "yes, there is a lot to be overwhelmed. i think the important thing is to stay focused and focus on what is being done to solve the problem.",
  "i know there are a lot online. there is a group called habitat for human being that does a lot for free.",
  "i hope that helped. i am glad i could help.",
  "you too!",
  "oh, i see. you mentioned that you are going to be in hospital for the rest of your life. does that mean you're staying there for your cousin?",
  "i am really sorry that happened to youand i think thats the best thing about being single.",
  "i am not working right now, but i know that some people are getting sick. i know it is very scary, but there is a lot of support available.",

  "you are very welcome. i wish you all the best in your endeavours.",

  "hello, i am here. i am available to talk about anything else.",
  "i would text first to let you know how it feels to be a friend",
  "what type of work are you looking for?",
  "it's okay to feel nervous about your own courses. you have to be careful when you go to choose your classes.",
  "have you tried talking to your doctor? they can help.",
  "i see. what is causing you to feel that way?",
  "i can tell you are feeling anxious about it, but i think you are doing your best and doing your part to get through this.",
  "i see. have you thought about talking to your doctor about this?",
  "i would suggest that he talks to you about it with him first. i would then try to go over how he is feeling and see if he understands",
  "no problem i hope things work out for you!",
  "how are you today?",
  "you're welcome. i know its hard, but just be positive and there for each other. i am sure you will come to terms with it.",
  "it sounds like you are having a hard year. i think you are doing your best and you have done your part to make it through this. i am confident that you will be able to overcome this.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, it sounds like it was a really difficult time for you.",

  "i am so sorry to hear that. cancer is so hard.",
  "do you think you will be able to move up?",
  "yes, that'll be the best way to do it.",
  "i can completely understand how you feel. i also have a hard financial situation and have been in the same situation.",
  "yeah that is a good idea",
  "i know it'll be tough, but just keep working hard. it'sn't easy but it'sworth it.",
  "it seems like you have a good plan.",
  "i can understand why you are worried. i have been in a similar situation and i know how difficult it is to be with someone who is so close to you.",
  "good afternoon. how are things going for you?",
  "i am sorry to here that. i am very sorry to know that your partner doesn't believe you.",
  "it is really not a good time to go any anywhere right now.",
  "i can understand that.",
  "it sounds as though you're doing a great job talking to him. i think you are very thoughtful and kind and have a great heart, and he is a very intelligent person. i would suggest that you all stay safe and healthy. i am sure you will be able to talk through this with him and make him feel good about it!",
  "oh wow! that sounds like such a great experience!",
  "what is making you feel anxious?",
  "i know. but there are always some good advice out there. and yes, they are not just for you. they are for others.",

  "that'sounds like it. i hope you feel better.",
  "hello. how are you doing?",
  "i think it'd be a great place to start.",
  "it's important to remember that the children have a responsibility to protect themselves and others. they will not want to hurt you or your family, and if they do not want you to see them, they won't be able to either.",
  "i can understand how you feel, i've had to learn from my parents before. i had to be very careful about how i was treated and when i did try to avoid getting caught up in too much.",
  "i can tell you are really stressed about this situation.",
  "have you tried to talk to your friends about this?",
  "i listen to hip hop and rap mostly.. lol",
  "oh haha. i was just thinking that too! loll",
  "yes, try to go for a walk and be happy",
  "i understand, i was in the same situation before i started looking for a job. but i got a job and it paid the bills.",
  "i understand how you feel, but maybe you could look at ways to get through this, from chatting to your partner, to getting advice from people you trust, and seeing if there is anything else that would help?",
  "i think that's a good idea, i know it might be hard but it'll help.",
  "i think there are a few agencies out there who offer gig work. i would suggest taking one look at those and finding out what the best place for you would be.",
  "yes, you should do it. i think it would help to put them in a safe place.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "ok. how are things going with you?",
  "i know it can be frustrating when people don't understand a conversation or their communication goes off the deep end. have you tried to explain to him that you feel the same way?",
  "i think that you should talk to them and see if you can solve anything.",
  "i know how you feel.",
  "oh wow, i didn't know you were 90. i've been through some really rough times, but it was a good experience and a good start.",
  "i mean do your job by doing it even though you feel you are not enough.",
  "i think you've got a great plan. i've been in a similar position before and it'll definitely help to get in touch with someone who can help you out.",
  "i understand. i have had similar situation. i think it is important to get professional help when you feel like you need it.",
  "you are welcome",
  "i completely understand! i think we are all in this together and i think that will be the best thing you can make out of this!",
  "i've been getting a little tired as well. what's going on?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. would you be willing to talk about this?",
  "oh i see. how long has this been happening?",
  "that'll be a real bummer.",
  "that's really hard. i can understand how you are feeling, but do you think you could communicate with your girlfriend through sign sign?",
  "i am so glad that you are starting to see things for what they are. it is a tough time, but we have to be strong.",
  "i think it is just going to be another case of you being treated badly and having to prove it",
  "that's great! i am so happy to hear that!",
  "it sounds like you're having issues with your sleep and your work schedule. are there any activities that you enjoy doing that you find helpful?",
  "you too.",
  "i have had a lot of friends who have had their lives changed due to a cheating ex. i know it'll be hard for you, but you can do it!",
  "no problem, i hope it all works out for you!",
  "i'm glad i could help. have a good day!",
  "do you have friends or family that you can talk to about how you are feeling?",
  "it'll be a while until the panda is over but i'd say it'd be worth a shot.",
  "i feel like you may have lost touch with your family.",
  "what has happened in your house?",
  "sleep is important",
  "oh i see, do you guys go out for a walk together often?",
  "oh i know, i can see how you are feeling right now!",
  "oh yeah i hear you. i am in the same boat, my friend went through the same thing and found a job quickly.",
  "i understand how you feel. the best thing i can recommend is to be yourself. do your best to stay positive and keep yourself busy.",
  "i can't wait to see you guys play!",
  "it must be really hard to have depression.",
  "what do you think could help you?",
  "i think the key is to find a balance between the work and your own personal life. if you have a job at home, then it should be okay to work at home while you do online school. if your job at work is at home it may be okay too.",
  "that is good news. is there anything else that you would like to talk about?",
  "it'd be great to be able to move to a different place. i know it'll be difficult, but i believe you can do it!",
  "it is been really tough, but everyone is going through the same thing at this point. i know it will get better for you, and i think you will find your happiness soon enough.",
  "i always thought that was a great way to express my anxiety. you could even say that you feel that you should be more confident in your abilities.",
  "that is understandable, it is a hard position to be in. i know it is difficult for you and your husband to be honest with each other, but there are ways to make it work out in the end.",
  "i know it can be a bit stressful at first but i know you can do it",
  "i understand. i have a tendency to do that when i feel like i'm having too much thoughts.",
  "i don'thing you'll be able to find anything helpful from this.",
  "you can feel proud of your service though, that's something we all need.",
  "that sounds like a great plan!",
  "maybe it is a bad idea to be with someone who is busy.",
  "have you talked to your husband about it?",
  "yeah, that'll help you remember that there are some good memories out there. and you will definitely be able remember those days for sure!",
  "it is very good for keeping your mind off of it and keeping your mental health in mind.",
  "you too!",
  "yes, it can definitely be tough being away. i know you will get through this!",
  "oh i can definitely understand that. it's difficult to see signs when someone has been in a relationship for so long.",
  "i see. do you have a good support system?",
  "i am good how can i help you",
  "do you think you could possibly talk to her about how you feel? if you don t, then you have no right to judge the situation.",
  "have you considered seeking professional help from someone else?",
  "have you tried reaching out to them through social media?",
  "that is a very difficult situation to be in. i can understand how you feel. i would have to go through this myself. i am sure that you have some valid concerns that you feel you can overcome though.",
  "i also love the beach! i hope that you can get out soon.",
  "you don't need to be friends. you need to find the right guy.",
  "that'sn't good. i would suggest you just be yourself, and let her know you'd like to be closer to her. it'll probably be easier to just ignore her... but you'll also have to take some time to sit down with her and let it out.",
  "i completely understand. i was in a similar situation. i tried to be more active but i ended up ending up being a little less productive than i thought.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i understand that can be very stressful.",
  "do you have any hobbies that you enjoy doing?",
  "i've been in a similar situation before, so i understand how you are feeling. i know it can be very difficult to make decisions about what to make but i'd suggest starting small, and then seeing if you can make some sort of plan to move up to higher paying position if there's nothing else available.",
  "you too!",
  "you can't control what you do in the office",
  "there are also a lot of free online resources available to help with your situation. there are some free youtube videos you can download to watch you do not have to use a computer.",
  "i'd love to go there asap!",
  "of course. what was the issue that you had with your cowork?",
  "i can understand how you feel. i have been in a similar situation before and i had a good relationship with my partner but i was very hurt by it.",
  "i think it would be helpful to research for support groups. you might be able to find some information online about your local area",
  "you too!",
  "that is great! what sort of groups are you in?",
  "maybe the other person will feel like they have to change their mind if you have a new job?",
  "what about your kids?",
  "i think it will be a good idea to talk about how your marriage has been going",
  "i have not, but if he did, he should not have cheated.",
  "yes, i think that is a good idea. you are making the right choices.",
  "what is your main source of income?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. do not worry. i have been through this myself and i know how devastating it can be.",
  "i would be furious too.",
  "just do not be so hard on yourself.",
  "if you are having trouble sleeping, perhaps you should try to talk to a professional? they are usually able to give you a professional opinion",
  "of course! i am glad that you are here to help me today!",
  "what is bothering you?",
  "that's really understandable.. do you have any friends or family you know who you can talk to about these concerns?",
  "i can relate to that, especially when i went through that same thing. it's not easy but you can learn from it!",
  "how long have you been together?",
  "if she has a good relationship with her father then i would feel better about the situation.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what is going on?",
  "i am doing well. what is going on?",
  "you as as well",
  "it is very hard to feel alone. i would be very hesitant to do that.",
  "i am well thanks. how can i help you today",
  "i think thats the most important thing to remember, and you are certainly doing your part to make sure they see you as healthy. i'm glad they've been understanding of your decision to stay home.",
  "you should not let this make you feel guilty.",
  "goodbye",
  "that's so hard, but i'm glad that you are doing something for them.",
  "i'll try and remember to do that anytime. i hope you have a good rest of your day!",
  "i am proud of you for being so kind and caring.",
  "i've been well. thanks for asking!",
  "two years is a long time. it's very difficult to get back together with someone you love. i have been in a similar situation where i had to break things off with my best friend. i felt like i was being judged for breaking up with someone.",
  "that sounds like it would be very difficult. have you talked to your friends and relatives about this?",
  "have you reached out to anyone about this issue?",
  "that's good. i've been having a lot of issues with my family lately too.",
  "i am happy to help you and i hope you are able to overcome this. it is really important to take care of yourself.",
  "you are welcome. i've been in a similar situation myself and i know how difficult it can be.",
  "i think maybe you could start small by doing something you enjoy doing, even if it'll take a while.",
  "if he is willing to give you money, then you should be able to do what he says.",
  "i've been there too. i was in a similar situation before. it is normal to feel low energy.",
  "it sounds like you are having a great time and your kids will enjoy christmas as well!",
  "i am glad i could be of some help.",
  "i have had to deal with a lot of abuse when i was in a relationship. i know how difficult it can be to deal from a family standpoint.",
  "that's a good idea, if you do end the relationship you can end the friendship",

  "i have not, but i have tried to reach out to my friends and family and see what they think about it",
  "wow, that's so terrible. it sounds as though he has a lot of issues.",
  "i think that might be a good plan.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i think you should tell him that you are seeking treatment and you need a mediator. you should not let him control you.",
  "i am not sure what that is.",
  "i can understand your frustration. it is difficult when you have no one to help you when you struggle.",
  "well i took it one day at a time and just talked to my coworkers about the things i was feeling down about.",
  "i am doing well, thank you.",
  "i've got two kids and they love to play with me too. i have tried to set up an indoor play area for them, but it has been hard to do so.",
  "i think you will be able too find something if you search online.",
  "hi! how are you doing today?",
  "oh, i didn'; t see it.",
  "i would just tell them that you are worried about them and that you feel like you can handle the situation, but that you don t want them to be stressed.",
  "thank you for talking!",
  "well, i am not sure if it would be legal to do that.. but you should look into it. you need some sort of counselling.. )",
  "oh no, can you tell me what's going on?",
  "i understand. this is the best time to move on from things that are stressful and stressful. i'm so glad you are feeling better and i wish you all the best!",
  "i know we are going to do great!",
  "it sounds like you are working hard and your parents are just being dicks.",
  "it's always good to be open and honest. you can always talk to them and ask why they don't like you.",
  "i used linkedin and i found a few companies that provided free classes and online courses. i also had a few job boards that i used to check for positions and found some really good ones.",
  "it has been a year or so",
  "i just stopped drinking. i tried to focus on other things, like my hobbies and maybe taking a few walks.",
  "i hope they are able to give you a chance to talk with them. have a good day!",

  "i understand. i also lost my work due to a injury. i worked from home and found a good job.",
  "i had a guy ghosted and he was the one i fell in love with. we met online, and i found him on instagram. i messaged him, and he messaged me back, saying he was interested. he was kind of mean, but he was honest. i just needed someone who cared and that is what i wanted, not someone who doesn't care about me.",
  "i know it can be very difficult when the intensity of attacks become so intense and overwhelming, i've had to deal with this myself.",
  "i've been in your shoes before and know how hard it can be. i also have had some close friends who were extremely supportive of me, but i was also very selfish. they were not always happy but they were also very supportive of my needs.",
  "that is great! it is important that you are trying to make a difference in the situation.",
  "i know it's hard to get through this pandemics, but i know that there is something that will help!",
  "if you feel nervous about it, i'd say make sure you don'' t put too much pressure on yourself. i've had people fail me in the past and i'll tell you this : i'ds not think you'll have a problem until you give the effort to try to help them.",
  "thank you so much! i'd like to chat with you again.",
  "i was planning on going somewhere with my family.",
  "so you found out about him cheating?",

  "i believe there are plenty of online jobs that offer online work.",
  "what has been happening to you lately?",
  "good thanks! how are you??",
  "oh that'll be a great distraction too!",
  "i would try to get another job if i were you",
  "have you tried looking online for other jobs?",
  "i understand, i also have had to deal with the same issue in the past. i have found that talking to people helps.",
  "i have found that talking to someone helps me be less anxious. it helps me feel less anxious and less like i am alone.",
  "i see. well i am glad you are trying to help.",
  "have you considered finding some sort of therapy for yourself? it might help you to think about how you feel about other people.",
  "that'd be a great start. i think you should try to keep your distance from him because he seems like a jerk.",
  "i think you could make it work. i think that a lot of people are in the same situation as you.",
  "how long were you together?",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "it could be a great way to get you some closure and perhaps even make some good friends too",
  "i understand that you are worried about your own financial situation and you feel that you need to take a risk. this is a tough spot to be in, but at the same time, i think it is worth talking to your employer about your options.",
  "it'll be worth a shot to try and see if any other places offer remote training.",
  "you will be surprised how much you like the houseplants!",
  "no problem! i hope that i have been able to be of some help. i am sure you will be able to overcome this in the near future.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i have lost a job before and i know how you feel.",
  "it seems like you are feeling anxious, but you are not being completely wrong.",
  "i am doing good, how are things going with you??",
  "it is really hard but at least you have a plan and a plan. you are in a great place.",
  "i understand completely. i feel the same way. i don t think anyone else has ever heard of me. but it's very difficult to find the motivation to work out what is causing you to be anxious.",
  "exactly. and if he is jealous, he should be ashamed of himself for doing that.",
  "i can understand that. i have been in situations like this as well and i know how difficult it is.",
  "i think that is part of the problem, we all have to be willing to change our ways to cope with things. i think it is important to remember that things are not always a good thing, and that things will come up again, but you have to remember the positives.",
  "i'm doing well.",
  "i completely understand. i have a lot of friends that i feel like i have to be more direct with.",
  "i can see how it would make you anxious to have to stay on the phone with him. do you have a plan for the future or is it just a plan?",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. i have been in this situation before and it really sucks. i think it'll be okay to talk to someone about this and see what they think.",
  "do you think she is willing and able to make the sacrifices for herself?",
  "i am glad i could be of some assistance.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, what was your previous situation?",
  "i would suggest you seek professional help from your boss. that is a really good way to get through this.",

  "thank you! i am very glad i could help you! have a great day!",
  "you've got this!",
  "is there anything specific that is making you feel anxious?",
  "wow, that'll be a very difficult situation. are you afraid of being thrown into an unhealthy relationship?",
  "i know it can be tough, but you can do it",
  "i am in florida. we have some lockdown evictions and they are not always necessary.",
  "what is making you feel this way?",
  "i hope you have a good day!",
  "i think it's great that you are able to discuss this with someone who has such a strong sense of empathy for you. that'll show her how much you value her.",
  "yeah i think you should do that too",
  "you are welcome. i am glad to hear it.",
  "ah, i see. that's a great field to be in.",
  "i understand, i myself have been down this road myself. i can tell that you are trying to keep yourself healthy.",
  "i hope you will get an interview and that you are able to make a little extra money.",
  "i can understand how you feel. i have experienced issues with my own weight and the struggle is so hard right now.",
  "i think you will find that it really helps to take some time to clear your head and get some perspective on the situation.",
  "i think you are doing the right thing. i think we need to celebrate the holiday and your feelings are valid.",
  "i see, so you are saying that you are flirt with her and not with you? is that right?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i think you should talk to your principal about this issue",
  "is it possible to have it cut back? i know some people have done that for years.",
  "i can understand how frustrating that is. i would be frustrated too. do you think that maybe you are doing all of the efforts because you have to?",
  "you too!",
  "i had a bad time during the war, so i stepped away.",
  "i think that you should be able to talk to someone about this. you should not feel like you have to go through this right now.",
  "i do sometimes. i am a teacher. i enjoy reading and talking to others.",
  "yes, bye",
  "what is going on?",
  "i would leave now but i am sure you can find a way to resolve this!",

  "i understand your pain",
  "you sound like a great employee. you deserve to have a chance to make the best of it.",
  "you are not a failure! you are a woman who is being cheated on and you should be proud of that!",
  "i know it is hard, but you will get through it.",
  "i am sure you will be fine.",
  "i'm good. thanks for asking.",
  "i am sorry that you have had such a hard time with your boss.",
  "you too!! you can take care of yourself and your kids in the mean time.",
  "i hope this helps. i hope you find some relief.",
  "i am sorry to here that. i have also lost friends and family in the past.",
  "yes, i think you would be able.",
  "you are very welcome. i wish you all the best in the future.",
  "i think that is a great idea. i think it would be helpful to take some time to think about what you want to do during the stressful time.",
  "that'll be a good idea!",
  "oh i see. so you are just not able to focus as much on what is going on around you. that's great! i know you can do it!",
  "you're welcome. i wish you the best of luck with everything. i know it can be hard at times, but i believe in you.",
  "i don ; t know. i would do what is best for you though, because even if they do find out, you will feel bad for it",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. i have been in a similar situation myself.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "oh no! that is horrible. how are you feeling?",
  "i think you've got this!",
  "i understand. i've also been stressed about my health during my pandemic and i also found that walking outside helped me stay safe.",
  "hello. i am here.",
  "i've had my fair share of breakups over the years and i can tell you that it is very difficult and heartbreaking to see someone else get hurt.",
  "i can understand that. i have experienced similar feelings before and it can be difficult to see what's going on in everyone.",
  "you are not alone in that. i have been through this before and it can be very isolating at times.",
  "i know, i know it'll take time to process the emotions, but i know you can do it.",
  "i think it is the best time to go. i think you will do great",
  "im from michigan and we have been hit hard",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "i would suggest giving them a call and explain the situation in a more positive way.",
  "true : ) we don'' t have a lot of them here though : (",
  "i'd suggest taking a few days off of work so you can talk to someone.",
  "are you okay?",
  "so you are interested in the men more than the women?",
  "that is good news. i hope you are able to get some sort of assistance from the government.",
  "i think it is important to take care of yourself first.",
  "if he does share then you should make friendship",
  "i am sorry to hear that. it'd be great to have something that you can use to get back into the fresh air.",
  "yes",
  "i think he should be comfortable with his underwear, not your feelings.",
  "i have been in the same situation and i can tell you it is very difficult. you are a good worker and your boss does not give you any respect for your work.",
  "how long has this been going on?",
  "i'm sure this will be a very hard time for everyone.",
  "yes, i think that is the right idea. i have found reaching out to people in similar situations has been helpful and i have tried to find a way to connect and connect with those close to me.",
  "i hope i have been able to be of some help. i am glad i could be of help",
  "you don'ts a good question. i have been cheated before. i went through a breakup and it was hard. but if you have the right attitude and know what you want, it'll be okay.",
  "do you think there is a possibility of you being taken advantage of?",
  "i can tell that you are extremely stressed about this.",
  "what're you feeling down?",
  "what is troubling you?",
  "it sounds as though this letter is a way to express how you feel about the situation.",
  "i know it seems like you are trying to be helpful, but i think that you need to be strong to handle the situation.",
  "i know you are going through a lot right now but try to focus on what you are doing right now and you will feel a lot better",
  "i can understand how you feel, i have been in that situation before.",
  "it sounds like you have been able to work from home for a while and have a good opportunity to meet new people. is that correct?",
  "yes, you too! you can come back anytime!",
  "if they refuse to leave, you can still reach out.",
  "i hope that i have been able to help you. i am happy to listen and support you as you are feeling this way.",
  "it will pass eventually just take your time",
  "bye",
  "i understand that you are feeling down. i am also having this same issue.",
  "i've been doing that since high school. it'll be tough, but it've helped me a lot.",
  "i've been doing both. i have a lot of online work but i'd like to be able to go home more often.",
  "i can'; t tell you how to do it, but i can tell you that i can see that you are an excellent worker and i believe you will find something you love!",
  "hi! how are you today?",
  "i completely understand that. it'll be tough to get through a lot at first, but it is worth a try.",
  "bye!!",
  "i am so sorry to hear that, are you able to find any help at all?",
  "i can't imagine the pain and pain that you will be going through with your children.",
  "hi there, how are you?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have your doctor heard of any other strategies you can try?",
  "i've been in a similar situation. i had a good friend who was in a relationship with someone else, but he broke up with me. i told him i was happy without him, and he left me.",
  "i am really sorry to see that. how long have you been in therapy?",
  "is this something you have in common with your friends?",
  "i understand, it'd be difficult to see your daughter in person, and it might be difficult for you to see her as well, even though it'll be easy for you.",
  "how are you today?",
  "i've been in your shoes before and i think that if you ask her, she'll be understanding and willing to give you extensions. if she's not, you should be able too.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "no problem i hope things work out for you and i wish you all the best",
  "i think that a movie that you can see would be a good way to connect with your loved ones.",
  "yeah i can imagine. it can be hard to make friends during the holidays when you don'' t have anyone to talk to.",
  "it does sound like you have a really low standard of sleep. do you feel tired during the day?",
  "i totally understand. it's difficult to find people who fit your interests, and i'm sure you can find someone else!",
  "bye",
  "that is a very hard thing to feel...",
  "what is on your mind?",
  "okay, well i hope you are feeling relaxed and relaxed.",
  "have a great night : ).",
  "but you have done nothing wrong. you're not a stranger.",
  "there is no shame in wanting those things, they are important tools for us to learn from our mistakes.",
  "okay, so, let's start with one problem at a time. i've had depression for years and i found that the best way to cope was to talk to a therapist and get help. sometimes, it can be helpful to talk with someone who has experienced it before.",
  "maybe, but he might not be. he may be just a weird guy.",
  "what's his reasoning behind his spending habit?",
  "well, if you'd like to go into the new startup field, you could consider taking the path to being an investment banker.",
  "that'll be a difficult conversation to be having, but i'd recommend that you have a conversation with him about this and see if he can respond in a more mature way.",
  "that is a good idea",
  "i hope it helps. i hope you find the solution.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i am sure you are feeling at least a little bit better now.",
  "have you tried looking online for jobs in your area? i know they have a lot of online job boards.",
  "im good, how are things going for you today?",
  "it might not be the best solution, but it'd be a start.",
  "you are welcome! i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day and thank you for chatting with me.",
  "i know that it is hard when you are in a hurry but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. i hope you are able to keep her safe and happy. i have faith that things will be better for her and her family soon.",
  "that is a great strategy. it is easy to do when the stock is so low.",
  "oh ok, i misunderstood.",
  "i also have had to cut back. i used to drink, and it has helped a lot. but i also started drinking again recently.",
  "you are welcome. i wish you the best of luck.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. have you tried to talk to your co workers about this?",
  "i think it would be a good idea.",
  "hi there, how are you doing today?",
  "i'm glad i could be of some help.",
  "you're welcome! i'd like to hear what you have in mind when you are ready to take the survey again.",
  "i've been there myself. it can be very upsetting to hear that you are depressed. can you tell me more about it?",
  "oh dear, that is not good. i would definitely be worried too.",
  "i am so sorry that you have to deal with this, i know how hard it is for you. it is so hard to not be able to see your child, but you're doing the right thing by reaching out and talking to someone about it.",
  "i think that is a good attitude to have - if the situation is not pleasant, just don'tgo ahead and make sure that you have someone to talk to and see if there is anything going on that could help",
  "maybe they can hang out with you and get you some vaccines",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have you tried any exercises to help you feel better?",
  "hi, how are you?",
  "oh yes, that is so hard.. i'm so sorry.",
  "i like to read. it helps to have something to do while i'm at home.",
  "i'd say that if you're in a stresssituation where you've been laid off, then you should be able to choose your own hours. if you work in a place that allows you to leave early, then that is a different story. but if you just want to leave, that is the way to go.",
  "i hope you have a good day and have a lovely evening!",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "i understand completely. i have had to close my business down due to pandemic.",
  "yes, it is. i am currently trying to work from home, so i have to stay at home with my partner.",
  "i know that it'll be very hard but you can do it!",
  "i've been there myself. it's been a very difficult time for me too. i know how difficult it must be to get through it.",
  "i hope that this has been helpful for you and you'll be able to overcome your worries with some rest.",
  "are u working from your home",
  "if he is older than 25, i think he needs a break. but you can always talk to him and see how his behaviour is affecting you. and see if he changes.",
  "ah, i see. i think that'll be a great time to get started!",
  "it'll get easier with time. it will take time, but it will get easier. just keep trying and you will get better.",
  "yes, it is quite common in the medical field to feel anxious about failure.",
  "i am doing well. thank you for asking.",
  "i believe that the world is full of problems that need to be resolved. there are many things we need to do to get back on track.",
  "i hope you have a lovely day and good luck with your future endeavors!",
  "it is! its easy to feel upset when we're so upset.",
  "you as well. you too.",
  "you could also try to find some sort of support group for your friends, family, and community to help you through this.",
  "it seems like there are lots of places that are hiring right now.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. are you trying to relax in the daytime?",
  "do you feel like you'd have enough free time to look into something else?",
  "i have a bit of a different perspective. i used to play video games all day and it was really hard to keep my head high. i just had to get some sleep and relax.",
  "oh no! i'm so sorry to here that. that's horrible. i've been through that myself and i know how painful it can be. have you had to go to a doctor or anything recently?",
  "how are you today?",
  "exactly. maybe start slowly and slowly. maybe take some time to think about the situation for a few days. then get back to focusing on the bigger picture.",
  "i understand. losing a working job is difficult.",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. i also feel like i am not doing as well as i would like to. i have a lot of anxiety and depression.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "i understand how you feel. i think you will be fine.",
  "well, i have been trying to find a way to get myself out of a funk and take care of myself. it is important to keep yourself busy.",
  "i hope that helped!",
  "i'll take your words as encouragement!",
  "if you do that it will be okay",
  "i would start by finding a new hobby that you enjoy and maybe just taking a break for a bit, then find a new activity that you like to do, and try to take some time away from the work and maybe go out for a walk.",
  "i am glad i could help. i hope you get the book out in time.",
  "i'm female and i have dealt with similar issues with my husband. it is a very common issue.",
  "you as well!",
  "i am glad i could help!",
  "do you have any family you could reach out to?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. would you like to talk about it?",
  "i have also had to deal with depression before and found it helpful to take a few minutes to breathe and take a deep breath before doing anything else.",
  "i see. have they ever tried to speak to you about how your feelings are affected by this? sometimes it helps to talk to people who have been in the same situation before and see what they can do to help.",
  "if it is something you want to do, then you can do that. sometimes it is best to try to make things work for yourself and not for others.",
  "you don'y think they are human with emotion and feelings?",
  "it's been a really tough time for me. i think most people do miss pegging but i don't know if that is possible for everyone.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i am really glad you are okay.",
  "yes i am. how can i help you today",
  "have you tried reaching out to friends?",
  "i know it can be difficult when someone is struggling financially, but i have learned that it'll only get worse from here. i have been in your shoes before and know how hard it is.",
  "i live in the south and it snowed here but i can tell you that it'll be beautiful soon. i hope that you have a safe trip to the park or something to do with your family and friends.",
  "and if she is willing to forgive and forgive, then you are doing the best you can.",
  "yes, i have. i am not sure if you are familiar with this or not but depression is a mental illness that affects people in a lot of ways. it affects people differently than we think.",
  "i think you've made the right decision and i think that you'll find that your family and i have a lot in common.",
  "i see. it sounds like you have a plan for your son. do you have any siblings or kids that you can spend time with?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i have had to go through a similar situation when i was going through a family loss.",
  "i used to use zoom, but i found that it was so helpful to zoom in and focus on things i really enjoyed.",
  "i can imagine that would make it hard to find work. i have found that when i am looking for a job, i usually have to do some sort of online search. i've found that a lot of people are very receptive to help when i need it.",
  "yes. it sounds like you have put yourself through the best of times. you are doing the right things and you are going to do the best you can. i think she will appreciate that.",
  "i can see how that is stressful.",
  "what do you think is making you feel worthwhile?",
  "i've had some similar situations in the past. i think you should just move on and be happy that she didn't do anything illegal.",

  "that's a good point.",
  "you are very welcome, and thank you for sharing with me.",
  "what field of business are you in?",
  "i don't think so. i would just try to look for another job if i were you.",
  "i had a lot of experience in it, but i just kept trying to focus on the things i wanted to do that i loved and found a job that i enjoyed.",
  "what do i do to help?",
  "yes, i think that a therapist is a great idea. it's a great way to help with your anxiety and to take care of yourself.",
  "thank you! i hope i was able to help you! it was very nice talking to you! have a wonderful day!",
  "i am glad i could be of some help.",
  "do you have anyone that you can talk to about it?",
  "do you have any hobbies?",
  "i know it is hard, but i think we can all make progress.",
  "i am male and i have had girls do that to me.",
  "you've been so welcome, i'm glad i was able to help!",
  "maybe you can write some journal or journal journal for yourself, you never know what you can do with your ex.",
  "sorry i didn't realize. i am in a bad mood",
  "have a lovely day",
  "i am glad to hear that, i wish you the best of luck with everything.",
  "yes but don't give your kids more attention when you can do it for free",

  "i would suggest that you should be honest with your friend and tell them that you are there for them and that you do not want to see them destroy their lives.",
  "yes, i think there may be some hateful thoughts, but i don t think there should be hatehateful opinions.",
  "it is a good resource for everyone. i think it is good that you have found a solution to your feelings.",
  "i know how hard this can be to deal with. it is not easy to understand.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i know how difficult it is to leave someone when you are feeling down.",
  "i think you can do it, i hope you can",
  "have you spoken to your boss about it?",
  "i think that it's important that you understand that you can't provide for your family. you could be providing for your own family, or your coworker.",
  "what kind of job do you have?",
  "i'm glad i could be of some help.",
  "do you think you will recover from this lockdowns?",
  "i know it'll be helpful to you in the long run.",
  "that sounds very difficult. why do you feel like everything is going to be down?",
  "i see, is it something that you like to do?",
  "yes i know you are right and i believe that you will make a great employee.",
  "ok thanks for sharing.",
  "you too!!",
  "that's a lot to deal with, especially after you're already dating.",
  "you need to press quit from your end",
  "i understand completely. i had a similar experience at the grocery store and the manager did not care for my honesty.",
  "have you considered talking to a professional about this? i have found that talking to someone about this can help me understand why i'm feeling so down and how to work through these feelings.",
  "i understand. it is a very difficult situation.",
  "i am glad to hear that. what are you having trouble with?",
  "is there anything else i can do for you? i can try to help by providing you with some good information and advice.",
  "i have found that zoom meetings are very helpful.. i don t worry about the people who are close to you, i worry about how they are treating me",
  "you'll find that a lot of people are feeling the same way. i hope things get better for you!",
  "that's great! what do you do for work?",
  "i can totally understand. my youngest has been having trouble sleeping too. it'll be tough when she is sick.",
  "it'll definitely be a great time!",
  "that is an awesome line, do u have any family or friends in the same situation?",
  "yes, that'll be a good starting point.",
  "i hope everything works out for you!",
  "have you tried to talk to your doctor about this?",
  "i would try to take some deep breaths. that helps me a lot. i think you are probably feeling a little bit less depressed now.",
  "i am in texas too and i have found that people who live near me are more than friendly.",
  "hello. how are you today?",
  "you too!",
  "i can see how that would be overwhelming. i am sure you will get through this.",
  "bye",
  "i think this will help you to get a little bit of extra time off. it also might help to give yourself time to do other things. like go for a walk or even do some exercising.",
  "i am in college too so i understand how you feel",
  "that's not good, what is the news?",
  "i understand that. it has been frustrating for sure.",
  "i would suggest not giving her any more information, because if she is a thief, you can see her for who she truly is. you don't want her to be a friend, you want her for your own sake.",
  "take care and be safe",
  "i can definitely understand that feeling.",
  "i can see how you would be concerned with that. i had a similar experience with online classes when i was in college",
  "i think you are right! i think it is important to be able too open up and discuss things with people who care about you!",
  "i hope you two can get through this and find peace",
  "well, my first breakup was when i was in college. i had a lot of breakups that i didn't want to deal with. i was very depressed.",
  "well if you want to go into engineering, i would recommend looking for a course that shows how to solve problems in a real world environment.",
  "counseling can be very helpful in this situation. counseling can also help you find a solution to the problem",
  "i understand completely. i've been there myself. it's not easy at all.",
  "yes, that would be a good start. i hope you've spoken with her and that she can be understanding.",
  "i understand that feeling of not being good enough. do you have a plan to improve?",
  "you're welcome.",
  "garbo's love for small animals can lead to a lot more damage than the regular dog.",
  "i think you will be okay. i think your going to be fine.",
  "i also use a timer. i set it on my phone and go through the timer and do tasks for 10 minutes each, then i have my phone in my hand and when i get done, i go back to my phone, and do my work for 10 mins. this way, i know i am not giving my child too much credit.",
  "why do you think that is?",
  "i understand. i have been in a similar situation myself. it was very upsetting.",
  "i'm glad i was able to help.",
  "it sounds like your daughter is being bullied in this area, and your son and daughters are going through the same thing.",
  "yes, it is a tough one, but perhaps you can take a few weeks off to retrain? or maybe do something fun like painting or baking?",
  "that must be a tough situation for you. is it an upper level supervisor or a higher one?",
  "i am well. how can i help you today?",
  "no, but i have had depression before and found it really helped me to stay away from it.",
  "you too!",
  "it'll take time to get used to them being there for you. i hope that i have been able to help you a little bit today.",
  "have you tried talking to your husband about this issue?",
  "i understand that. i have been in a similar situation before and it was very stressful.",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "yes, i think you should try to make your fiancée happy and then just be yourself.",
  "that sounds like a very thoughtful gift! i'd be really sad if my kids didn't get me anything too.",
  "it sounds like you are doing the right thing, and i can understand why you are feeling down.",
  "i had no idea what to say. i was afraid to say anything.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, is there anything specific you'd like to talk about?",
  "i'll definitely be here for you if you need me!",
  "i see that you feel that you don'; t like the architecture path. i'm sure you will get there eventually.",
  "i've been in similar situations before, and it can be very frustrating when you feel like you're being bulled.",
  "bye",
  "oh wow, that is not ok.",
  "you could move with them and your dad will be your friend",
  "yes, i can help. i have found that when i find a new hobby, i find that i find myself more interested in new hobbies: reading, writing, etc., and i find it helps to take a break from reading and spend time focusing on other things.",
  "i'm really sorry that you've been through that. i know it's hard to be in a relationship when you'll be in your own.",
  "i am also excited for those!",
  "you are so motivated to do it though.",
  "have you been able to talk to any of your family members about covid?",
  "yes it has been very hard for me to see my family. i can tell you that i have had a lot of hard times with people who were close to me and were just taking advantage of me.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that, i can relate. i have had ulceratives colitis and it is scary.",
  "oh wow, i've had a similar situation happen to me before. i had a neighbor that attacked my cat, and he tried to get the dog back home. i told him that i had to get it put to good use so that he wouldn't have to get another one, but he didn't respond at all. he just got mad and said it was wrong of him to do it.",
  "you are welcome. i hope you can get some relief.",
  "of course, i hope everything goes well with you!",
  "good luck to you as well!",
  "that sounds like a great idea! i think you are going to do really well on all of those things.",
  "yes, it'll be much easier to use zoom now. we need to get used to zoom!",
  "so you're looking for a job right now but you are not sure if you are going to get one or not?",
  "yeah, it has been a long year. but you can always do it, even if it is tough.",
  "oh i see. that can be hard to come to terms with when emotions are being taken out on you.",
  "i am sorry to hear this.",
  "have you considered talking to your friends and family about this?",
  "haha! that'll be a challenge!! i can understand why you'd feel that way. i believe you'll get through it!",
  "i would recommend you to look into the support groups there, or even seeking professional help. i think that you can do a lot with your time and money now.",
  "from what we have seen, you have felt very negative about the situation and are seeking help.",
  "you too!",
  "i am doing well. how are things with you? what can i help you with today?",
  "i hear you. i also have a relatively small amount of savings. i think it's important to make sure that you have a safe amount of money to save.",
  "i'm good. how is your day going?",
  "do you feel that you have been able to take care of your pets while they are out of the house?",
  "i understand that covid is stressful, i also lost my career due to it.",
  "i love zebradas!",
  "you said you were in a lot. that must have been difficult for you to move away from your best friend.",
  "i think you are in a good place. we have to find ways to make new friends, and you need to learn to be open to new challenges.",
  "are you in a class that you feel is important?",
  "i would try to focus on yourself and your future. maybe you could take a break from her and give her time to heal.",
  "i would start looking online. there are many opportunities out there for people who are looking for new careers.",
  "i've been there. i have had to deal with it myself. i also had to get up and change my clothes for a while too. i felt really bad about it, but i did it.",
  "i have struggled with anxiety and anxiety.",
  "that's understandable. i have been in a similar situation, but i had a close friend who was in a much better place than me and it took a little time to build up the tension.",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "i understand.",
  "i think there is a lot of opportunities for that at university. i was in a class with a guy who had excel skills and he did great. he was a professor and he made some great money.",
  "i've been there myself. it'll be tough, but it'd be worth it. you can always try to find something new if you have a chance.",
  "i understand. it was hard for me to get out of the house, but i did manage.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. what is going on?",
  "thank you! i have a lovely day!",
  "i understand that, i have found that trying to focus on my studies helps me more than others.",
  "i hope i was able to help you.",
  "i have found that dealing with people who don ; t like or respect me has been very helpful.",
  "i understand your concern. i myself have dealt with the same concerns before.",
  "yes, you will have plenty of time to do your own things.",
  "is there a way you can work from home without having to deal with the pandemic?",
  "i think that is the right time to reach out. i think you will be able to recover in time.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "that is really hard. what was the reason you switched careers?",
  "i understand that you are struggling with communication. i myself am not a sociable guy. i find it very difficult to socialize.",
  "what type of work are you looking for?",
  "have you talked to him about this issue?",
  "i am so sorry that this happened to you.",
  "you too!",
  "i'd like to encourage you to seek professional help but i know it might not be for everyone",
  "oh no! that sounds like a very difficult situation. i can understand why you are upset.",
  "thank you. have a wonderful day!",
  "so you are feeling sad about something?",
  "i'll be sure to reach out anytime, and yes i'd love to help you out!",
  "i would say that fighting is never a good idea. it is a losing fight.",
  "hello. how are you?",
  "i understand, and i am sure your parents will support you. good luck",
  "you are right, the house is a big source of stress. but i think you are taking the steps to get back to normal. it sounds like you are doing the right thing.",
  "you are welcome. i am glad that i helped.",
  "glad i could help. i hope i have been able to help.",
  "if they're not even together, then you have no control over this. you have the right to say no.",
  "that sounds like a great idea! i think you are definitely on the right path here!",
  "i would be too. i have been in an office job and it is really hard to trust people.",
  "i am not sure if that would be helpful for you personally but i know that there are lots of people out there who can help you get better sleep.",
  "what is going on?",
  "i hope you are able to find something that works for you",
  "what type of work did you do?",
  "you've been so welcome! have a wonderful day!",
  "i know it's hard right now, but you'll get through this.",
  "i understand. i'd like to offer some advice, but i don't know what i can provide you with.",
  "did you ask her why she did it? maybe there's some legal advice on there?",
  "i loved to read and i did some online reading as well.",
  "i am glad to hear that you are feeling a little better. i think you have a great outlook on things.",
  "i am happy to help you. you are doing the right thing by not fighting bullies, and it will make you feel better in the long run.",
  "i think that is a very difficult situation for both of you.",
  "i've been good, thank you.",
  "hello! how are you?",
  "it really does make me feel bad when i think of that. i think it would be a good idea to try to find a way to work out a way through it, even if it'd only be a little bit.",
  "what type of job are you looking for?",
  "i've been in that situation myself. i can tell you from experience that it's tough.",
  "i can definitely understand how stressful that would make you. i would be so upset if that happened to me.",
  "that'sn't very good. i'd feel bad for you too.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, what do you want to talk about?",
  "have you thought about trying to find a local group or just a local community of people who are close to you?",
  "i've had similar situations with my best friends, they always want to be the first to leave but i'll bet you feel the same way.",
  "i think it'd be best for her to get a mentor. she needs to be able to communicate with you as well as to how you're feeling.",
  "i've been there before myself. it sounds like you are really trying hard, and i'd suggest you try to focus on what you want to do, and not what you feel is causing her to do this.",
  "i think that'll work for a few years. it might help to have a conversation with her and see what her reasoning is and maybe try to talk it out.",
  "it was nice talking to you too.",
  "jack russell is great. i also have a corgi and he is smart and loving.",
  "i'm here for you too.",
  "so you are having trouble getting enough sleep?",
  "thats great! i think that you should be proud of yourself.",
  "that's an awful way to think! i think you are a good person. i'd say you have a great friend and a great family!",
  "i hope i have been able to help you.",
  "i am doing okay, thanks for asking. what's going on with you?",
  "you too!",
  "i've been in that position before, it's a rough time, but you can do it!",
  "have you thought about reaching out to her family?",
  "i have had my share of issues with my husband in the past. i have felt frustrated and frustrated by him too.",
  "that is understandable. do you feel comfortable doing that?",
  "why are you feeling sad?",
  "that'sn't a good sign at all.",
  "i've tried to make sure that i only take small breaks during the week to get some sleep when i'll be up, even if i can't do that at the end of the day.",
  "i used to think like that too. but i found that a lot more work has been done by other people. i think that it'll help you to focus on your own work and not worry about other workers.",
  "yes i completely agree.",
  "oh wow! i'd love to visit canada one day. i think that'd be a great way to help you. do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy doing in your spare time?",
  "i see. i can understand why that would make you feel hopeless. but if you have a plan, you can set it up.",
  "i am a real one. i watch a lot of tv shows online.",
  "i can totally relate to that.",
  "i think you should try to make the best of it. it doesn'' t matter if you are right or wrong, just as long as you are happy.",
  "i understand. it is a difficult time to deal with the pandemics.",
  "i am good. is there anything bothering you? what is bothering you today?",
  "what do you think might help you get a better job?",
  "i understand how you are feeling. i have had that happen myself.",
  "i understand how difficult this is. i went through the same thing in my late 30s. i was so hurt.",
  "yes! i want my husband to be happy too.",
  "i see. i can understand why that would make you worry.",
  "yes, i do too. i wish you the best of luck. take care.",
  "i'm doing good, what can i help you with today?",
  "i understand completely, i lost my husband when i was in college too.",
  "no problem, i really hope that we can help each other through this.",
  "that sounds like a great way to get out of the situation and maybe start fresh again",
  "i see. i understand how you'd be upset. is there any other way to make money besides your daughter's?",
  "ok, i can help you",
  "oh i'm sorry to hear that. what's going on?",
  "so you are trying to study all the way through then?",
  "if you feel that you need the extra cash, you could look for an online job.",
  "sure, what can i help you with?",
  "you've got this! i'm glad i was able to help. i hope you'll be able to find a job soon!",
  "oh i see. it sounds like you were out on the same coast for 15 yrs and he was demanding an explanation.",
  "i am glad to hear you are having some positive conversations.",
  "do you know what your position is currently?",
  "it'll be hard to do when you are so stressed out about the situation.",
  "do you have a balcony or fridge?",
  "it's ok, you should try to keep calm and don't let your anxiety get to you. just make a list of how often you make these mistakes",
  "it sounds like they are being distant because they have not reached out for help.",
  "it sounds like you are having a hard time because you haven't told them why you're drinking. you can tell them that and see if they want to talk about it.",
  "i understand. i have been in a similar situation. i was in a lot of different jobs and i have learned a lot.",
  "i can't promise to help you but i have seen people suffer from financial issues and i know it must be frustrating. i hope that you will be able too soon and i wish you the best of luck.",
  "what is making you feel frustrated?",
  "of course! i hope that i was able to help you.",
  "i understand. i think it would be good to talk with someone who can help.",
  "i can't tell you how many times i have gotten a response for a cover letter. i've had to refill them twice, and it's been a nightmare.",
  "i would suggest taking some time to set boundaries. if you are not comfortable with your boundaries, you should not be treating others like that.",
  "ah, it sounds like you are feeling anxious because you have no choice but to take a leap and get your degree.",
  "yes, meditating can help me a lot.",
  "of course. i've been there. i felt like a complete failure once i started talking to my friend. i had to seek professional help.",
  "try going to a local university or a local local library or something.",
  "that'sn't a problem at all! i hope that it does work out for you!",
  "i hope so too. you can come out from this if you want.",
  "i am happy to hear that you are with your family and that you were able to reach out to them.",
  "i think that is a great idea. i would suggest looking at resources online, like food banks or other health care services.",
  "hmm i can understand that, sleeping is not good for you",
  "i hope you do as well.",
  "i understand. i was in your shoes. i lost my job a few months ago. i had to move to another country and i was able to find a job.",
  "is there any way you could look at it that you may be able to make some extra money?",
  "have you tried telling her how you feel and see if she is willing to try to be more helpful?",
  "you are very welcome. i wish you the best and hope you have been able to get over this.",
  "i'm doing good. how can i help you today?",
  "maybe god is there for you, god will help you through this.",
  "i know this is a long time. but you could always try to reframe the weight loss goals and maybe consider changing them to be more beneficial for you.",
  "lol - well i wish you all the best. take care",
  "hello, i am here for you",
  "you too, have a wonderful day and good luck!",
  "you are very welcome. god bless you.",
  "thats the spirit!",
  "i can imagine your manager has a lot of trouble with this. i would say to just make sure you do your job well next time.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "are you a student",
  "i think that is the best way to go about this.",
  "you should try it and see if it helps.",
  "oh no! i've been in that situation too. i was in a relationship with someone and he cheated on me and broke up with me. he never let me have my wedding until i was 25.",
  "it is hard but we have to do our best.",
  "i see. is there anyone else that could help you out?",
  "you too : ) i wish you all the best!",
  "yeah, that'd be great!",
  "i understand. i had the same concern when i was in my current job.",
  "mts has a list of forums. you can search for forums and hit hits. you could also search for hits that you would be interested in, such as hits that have only a small number of hits.",
  "well i would suggest looking into local help centers or getting some sort of counselling from her family and friends.",
  "it sounds as though you are trying to decide which is the better choice, and you are choosing between two that are not necessarily compatible.",
  "that is wonderful! i hope that you are able to make a better decision than that. i wish you the best of luck!",
  "i am glad to hear that you are doing so well.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i know that it can feel very lonely to feel lonely, especially since you are writing for a living.",
  "you are welcome! i hope it helps.",
  "i had a lab named dobby. i remember him being so cute and loving. i have a cat and two dogs now. i used to have two. they are so sweet and playful.",
  "that is an understandable situation. what are your family issues?",
  "yes, it can be very difficult to figure it out.",
  "what dressing style is it?",
  "i am so glad i could be of assistance. goodbye",
  "it looks like you have a lot going on, but i am sure you will get through it. i am glad that you are seeking help from others.",
  "thank you! you too!",
  "i can see how this is frustrating for you.",
  "i volunteer too. it sounds like you are trying to find something that will pay the bills and maybe even help you find a better job",
  "it sounds like you are feeling the pressure to move forward and this has led to you not being able to move forwards.",
  "i would suggest you talk to your supervisor and see what they can say. it might help to talk to hr and see how they can help you get a raise.",
  "three years seems a long way away. do you feel like there is something wrong with your relationship?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what made you feel this way?",
  "thanks!",
  "i can see how that is very difficult. it sounds like you are trying very hard to stay positive and you are doing everything you can to do it.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i am sure you are doing great.",
  "yes i find it to be a good start",
  "i am glad to hear you are not as afraid of video as i am.",
  "i did not pay for it. i was able to get a loan through an insurance company. i took it for granted that it was free and i could use it to pay for my mortgage.",
  "i think that a lot people struggle with not being able to make it to bed early.",
  "no, i am not a psychologist. i just have a good support system in my house. i like that you reached out and tried to talk to me about your feelings, and i think you can too.",
  "okay. so you are having some issues with social distance. is that correct?",
  "oh no, i understand. do you have a budget?",
  "is there anything else you'd like to discuss with me?",
  "i have been in a similar situation with a teacher talking too. i can imagine it is very difficult.",

  "i am glad i was able to help you!",
  "i'll bet there's plenty of resources out there for you!",
  "that's great that you think that you have a plan for when you need to take the exam.",
  "what is the problem?",

  "what about something like the movie you guys want to see?",
  "hi larry! i've been there too. i have been there myself and it's very stressful and challenging.",
  "yeah i have had some issues like that too. i had to take vitamins for mine and i was able to treat them by doing a lot more physical activity.",
  "i've felt the same way before... especially since i met my ex boyfriend of two years.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that, it sounds like you are having a hard time with your relationship.",
  "i am sure you are doing just fine now. it is hard to get through this time especially after such a long time.",
  "i've been through a similar situation myself. it was really hard, but i think you'll do fine!",
  "yes, research has helped me a lot. it helps me to be able to give myself some time to reflect on my options.",
  "i understand that, but there are plenty of other people out there that are interested in it and have a good deal of passion.",
  "what is your presentation about?",
  "oh wow, i didn'tsee that. i thought she had depression. i've had to talk to my kids about that.",
  "i think that would be a good first step",
  "i've been in this situation too. have there been any plans of moving forward to help with your loneliness?",
  "oh wow, that's very unusual, i can understand how it feels like that",
  "try to talk to your friend about what made you happy and try to find a good friend that you can talk to",
  "thats great, i think that is a great way to look at it.",
  "it is a natural vitamins and vitamin d supplement.",
  "you are welcome",
  "yes it is. it's an online dating site.",
  "you too!",
  "i feel you. i am an adult and my kids are 4 and 5. i can feel how sad they are right now.",
  "that is understandable. it is difficult to get through a breakup. do your friends help you during this time?",
  "that'll be tough, but i think that you should be able to do it! it'll help you focus on your own problems rather than yourself.",
  "i can understand that. i would say to put them first because they are putting their feelings first and health second.",
  "that'd be a difficult situation to deal with. i've dealt with similar issues myself and i know how hard it is to deal without talking to someone. it'd definitely be nice to talk to someone who has been through something similar, though!",
  "what else do you want to know?",
  "what is going on?",
  "you could always use a pen and ink to help him remember when to stop talking.",
  "yes, i completely understand. i have been in this situation before and i feel isolated too. i think it's hard to get out of the house, especially during this pannoic. i don ; t know if there is a plan for the future, but i think there is an effort to get back into the habit of doing something about the pandemics.",
  "i hope you are able to complete your tests!",
  "oh, i'll bet it hurts. did you break up with him?",
  "hello, what's going on?",
  "you just gotta take your mind off of it and focus on the good things.",
  "i have found that focusing on positive things like reading or doing crafts can help.",
  "you do need to go to a professional.",
  "have you tried seeking any support groups that are also available for you?",
  "i am good, how is your night going?",
  "i've heard of people who get really stressed out when they're doing things that don't allow them to do their job well.",
  "i've been there, i know how hard it is.",
  "have you tried to talk them out of leaving you alone?",
  "i can understand why that would make you angry. i had a similar situation and it really hurt my mood.",
  "painting and reading are my favorites. i also like to travel, i find it really fun and enjoyable.",
  "yeah, sometimes i feel that way. i used to walk around a lot with my dog. he didn't feel as good, but he kept moving.",
  "i understand. i have been in this position before and it was very stressful",
  "i understand, but don't think you are the only one who needs to do this, if he doesn't want to be around you he isn't worth your time",
  "i hope i have been able to be of some help.",
  "have you tried talking to her about this? perhaps talking with someone who is not close to you would help her to understand what is going on?",
  "i can see that this would make you feel really down.",
  "do you have a family member that can help you cope with this?",
  "i hope you can help in the future as well.",
  "bye!",
  "i am glad i could be of some help. i hope that things are going well for you.",
  "ah, i totally get that. cats are great companions but i don ; t think i could be with one d",

  "why can't you sleep?",
  "i am happy to help you out!",
  "i think you should try to find some kind of support from people who are close to you. maybe your aunt will understand and maybe she will help you.",
  "it sounds like you are doing your best with your grades, and i think that is a good thing.",
  "i think it'll be good to give him some space and then try to talk to him about how you're feeling and what you want from him. you want to be his friend, but he doesn't seem to be there for you, so i'm sure you'd want to find a better fit for yourself.",
  "you'm so welcome! i hope you enjoy the rest of your day : ) i hope that you have a wonderful day!",
  "i know it can be hard at the moment but have you considered looking for unemployment?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. have you tried talking to your friends and family about how you are feeling and how you feel?",
  "that is understandable. i have had friends who were so busy and it was hard for me to find one.",
  "i have. it was very stressing. i also did a lot of recalicational work. it wasn't a great experience.",
  "i completely understand. i have been in that situation before.",
  "i know that feeling. i lost my job and now i have no money to pay it.",
  "perhaps you could contact your local school for some guidance or guidance counselling?",

  "i think you should do that.",
  "i hear you on that. we have to be very patient with our kids and we are not the best.",
  "thats great! you will be fine.",
  "what kind of unknowings?",
  "you too!",
  "how are you feeling?",
  "that sounds like a very difficult situation to be in. i've been in a similar situation before.",

  "that must be frustrating for her. i have a daughter and she is the same way. she will turn off the lights when she wants to play or use her phone when she gets home from school.",
  "i think you could always try and see what options are available in your city. it could be beneficial to reach out to a local board and see if they can offer some suggestions based on your experience.",
  "absolutely! i've been through it and i can tell you from experience that it is extremely difficult to get a new job, especially after such a tough time.",
  "i see.. i think it might be because they don'thing you're valued enough..",
  "sometimes you just have to put your head down and take the time to do things.",

  "i hope that works out for you. it'll be a really good team.",
  "i've been trying to find a way to stay positive and keep my mind busy.",

  "i am so sorry to hear that. do you have any idea what type of job you would like to take?",
  "yes you are right, it's not for women and it doesn t work for all women.",

  "i did, but there are also free apps that will let you download tracks to calm you.",
  "do you want to talk about the reasons why you broke up?",
  "there are plenty of people out there who are worried about covid19.",
  "ok so you have a supervisor that is favorable to your manager, and you are being treated badly because of your peers'opinion.",
  "you are welcome. you can reach out anytime and i am happy to listen.",
  "it sounds like you are doing a lot of work for your company, and are not being paid enough. i would recommend a raise.",
  "i'm here for you. how can i help you?",
  "i know it's tough.. i've been in this same position myself and it'll get better.. and it doesn't seem like it'd be a bad thing to tell your wife.",
  "no problem",
  "press quit : ) i am so glad that you feel better.",
  "what is it about the details you wrote that makes you feel like you are a kid?",

  "yes i do feel that.",
  "you should be able too!",
  "it sounds like you are looking for a job that you could possibly use, but you are not sure what position to apply for.",
  "i'd be worried about people being so quick to judge. have you ever tried to talk to your friends and family about this?",
  "i understand you feel stuck. how long have you been there?",
  "i think that you should talk to your ex about it.",
  "hello. how are you?",
  "i think we are all here to help each other.",
  "i would say that it would not be a reflection of you if they were willing to sit down and talk about the situation and not the relationship itself.",
  "yes, setting a schedule will help you to keep your mind occupied while you work.",
  "merry christmas to you too!",
  "i had a similar experience. it took a while for my manager to get over the toxic attitude, but it was worth it.",

  "have you tried any other form of social media support? i know that there are many people out there that can help with this.",
  "it is very difficult to juxta- out of control with the current state of affairs. you have to find a balance between managing and managing, which seems like a great option!",
  "i'd say that the most important thing is to keep busy and keep your mind busy. if you are feeling overwhelmed, don'' t worry too much. do your best to do your work and your grades. it'll help you feel less stressed.",
  "ok. i would suggest just speaking with him and let him know that you are here for him and he is going to respect your decision.",

  "i hear you on that. i have been in the same situation myself.",
  "what's been bothering you lately?",
  "i like to read and enjoy historical nonfictions. i also like fictions that have stories about people who are being forced to live in a dystopia.",

  "i can understand how you are feeling. i am in the same situation. i can tell you are prepared for it.",
  "i see. so you are concerned about how you could end it, but you are worried about what you might do?",
  "why do you think they are being quiet?",

  "i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day!",
  "maybe just wait a little bit, and see if you feel comfortable with it.",
  "do you have any friends or family that you can reach out to?",
  "i would suggest taking a walk or sitting down and meditating",
  "i am glad to hear it! i wish you the best of luck!",
  "i hope i have helped you. i wish you all the best.",
  "i understand. it is hard to see things from a certain perspective. it's hard to know what to do when someone is cheating. i do hope that you guys can work through this together.",
  "oh wow 19 credits! that's rough. it'll be ok!",
  "well, i think it'd be good to start looking for work right now before you move on to the next part time job, then when things start to get better, you can start looking at opportunities for jobs.",

  "i love reading and doing some online things. i also love to go on walks and hike.",
  "do you have any sort of contact information for your boss?",
  "i'm not sure what your skills are, but there are many people who have tried to be in charge of things and have found success.",
  "it is not your fault, but it is just a bit of time to move on. you can't just throw yourself in a new place, it'll happen again, you have to figure out how to get through this.",
  "wow, that must be really hard.",
  "that sounds like a good way to have some fun. do you enjoy the night time with friends?",
  "what kind of work are you looking for?",
  "i don'think you should laugh at yourself. you sound like a very strong person and i think you are going to be fine in the next couple of years.",
  "i know it sounds cliche, but i think it's worth trying to find new hobby\" things that make you happy.",
  "thank you!",
  "i am happy to hear that. i know that sometimes emotions can affect us emotionally, but if you try to just let go and let it pass, it may be a better opportunity to get a new friend and a better relationship.",
  "what sort of things do you enjoy doing in your spare time?",
  "i understand you are feeling overwhelmed by all the news, is there anything else that you would like to talk about?",
  "do you mean you are feeling helpless because you have a bad day?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i would suggest trying to contact your local government or other agencies to talk to them.",
  "i'd say that i like it because it is very rewarding and i like the flexibility it provides me. i am also looking forward to the future and i'll be working in the field that keeps me busy.",
  "i am sure it will.",
  "i don't know.. you can'r not exactly sure. i think you should always be careful though, especially since you are a veteran.",
  "i have always wanted to be a decorator. i love making gifts and making them to my kids!",

  "that is really hard. i am sorry. what do you think the cause of the breakup was?",
  "hi, how are you today?",
  "yes! what would you like to discuss?",
  "or you could be honest with doug and he'd never cheat on her.",
  "i can understand that. i have been in a situation like that myself. i had to get a counselling for covid issues and it was really difficult for me.",
  "i like it because it relaxes me and prevents me from thinking",
  "bye",
  "i'm glad i could help you.",
  "i would just do my best to keep my head down and make a light talking about the situation.",
  "goodbye!",
  "just start slowly and keep thinking about it",

  "i am so sorry.. i can't believe it happened...",

  "you got it! you'll look great!",
  "that'll be a great start.",
  "that must be very hard to move away from your parents. do you live with them?",
  "why are you sad?",
  "i think you should call the credit card company and see what they have in place. you can also try contacting unemployment to see what kind of work they are doing.",
  "i can't remember the reason but i know it sounds like they might be mad that you were invited and they don'thing you did anything wrong.",
  "oh i am so sorry. i can only imagine how hard this must be for you. i have been in a similar situation in the past. i would try to find something to occupy yourself and focus on.",

  "hi there, how are you doing?",
  "i hope everything goes well for you",
  "great!",
  "i'd say it'll help to know who you are talking to.",
  "yes, i am in a very rural area so there are many people with families that don't have any access to those services.",

  "hello, what is the problem?",
  "ok. what is your name?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. how do you feel about the breakup?",

  "i'd be worried that if you were not able to share your feelings with them, you might be worried you wouldn't be able to see them.",
  "i know it feels like it's a long time, but i believe you can make it through it!",
  "i have had a similar experience before where my parents refuse to apologize for me. they would have to forgive me if i did not tell them why.",
  "i think you're absolutely right, it'll be a good year until everyone is ready for it. have you tried to keep your mind off of things?",

  "i've heard that there are a lot jobs there, maybe even jobs there for you too.",
  "i understand that. i also feel that the board is being intrusive and you are not doing your best.",
  "i understand you feelings",
  "i would urge you to be more careful with your friends. it sounds to me that they are a bit selfish.",

  "i would definitely be prepared for that. sometimes the best thing to do is to take the time to make a plan for the task and then plan ahead for it. if there is nothing in particular that you would like to do, you can always go over the resume and take a break and take the survey.",
  "i've had problems with people leaving me out too, i just wanted to be sure i was not alone.",
  "i am confident in myself, i believe that i will be one day \" one day",
  "you are absolutely right about that.",
  "i am in year 4 and i have a good deal of contacts, but you could always look for a position that you can work in that you would be able to provide for yourself in the future.",
  "i went through a similar situation when my fiance was in college. he's away from his family for a few years, but he'll be back soon.",
  "i understand how you are feeling. i am in school as well and i have been stressed about my exams too. it is important to remember that you have a lot of work to do and that your grade is very important.",
  "i completely understand. i was in the same position. i had to wait until my mid 40's to be able to work and i was not able to afford a lot of time to take care of myself.",
  "you sound like you are doing your best. i hope that this goes well for you.",
  "it definitely helps to clear your mind before bed.",
  "ah i see. so you are having trouble studying, and then you are worried about the pandotonics?",
  "i'm not sure if you know what the word stress means, but i can tell you that it means stress.",
  "bye! : )",
  "i would suggest that you tell your friends that you are not drinking at all. that way you are at least able to control how you consume.",
  "you are in school for what exactly?",
  "i hope things get better for you! you too!",
  "it took me a long time to find a new hobby, but i got a new one recently and i have enjoyed it.",
  "i can understand how you feel. it sounds like he is trying to keep his mom safe.",
  "you can also try to use your resume to get a reference.",
  "i know it is very hard right now, but there are also agencies out there that are offering free medical care. i know this is a huge step forward, but you could look into this.",
  "it'll be more of a loss than anything! you are doing your best to help your friend and your feelings are hurting your own feelings.",
  "i understand how you feel. im a little bit of a nerd too, but i think therapy is great!",
  "yes, it did, it helped me to be able to tell people that i am not alone in this situation.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. do you feel like you are having a hard time keeping in touch?",
  "i'd suggest that you take a few minutes to think about what you can do to help your self, instead of just dwelling on the past.",
  "it definitely is!",
  "have you thought about any online support groups or activities that can help you cope with your exams?",
  "hello how are you doing today?",
  "do you think you could talk to your son about it? maybe you can talk to him about his health and also how you feel.",
  "yes, it is.",
  "that is good, trust is key.",
  "i am glad i could help. i hope you are able to work out your fears and you are doing great!",
  "sometimes, it can be hard to start to get into a groove.",
  "i'm good, thanks for asking. what is going on?",
  "i know how you feel. i have had to deal with that in the past.",
  "that makes sense.",
  "you are very welcome.",
  "yes, and just remember that, it is not the fault of you to drink.",
  "you have a good day!",
  "i would definitely take a step back and try to remember the good old days when we were all doing our best, and not being overwhelmed with the new things.",
  "i hear that. sometimes the best way to approach a problem is to seek out the right solution.",
  "oh wow that is a long time. i can understand how you feel, it's been a tough year for everyone.",
  "thanks : ).. good luck!",
  "i hear you, i have been in the same situation. what industry do you work in? have you tried any online work that you enjoy?",
  "it sounds like they are not aware of you making the best choice.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i can feel your sadness and it is hard for me to talk about it.",
  "i've been there myself. it can be very difficult.",
  "i am glad you are reaching out to help.",
  "i've been there. it's not easy, but i know it'll get better!",
  "i understand, but it sounds like you are feeling a little overwhelmed by your relationships. what are some ways to find a new hobby?",
  "so you are saying that you have no people to talk to about these feelings? do you feel that you are alone in your feelings or do you have anyone else to talk with?",
  "i also have found that it can be very helpful when i'll be out of work, or in a busy area, or just in my home, and have to focus on something else.",
  "i see. i think that you might be doing your best to get through this, even though it's not easy.",
  "bye!",
  "well, it's important to be prepared, don't be afraid to be yourself.",
  "i like to read romantic novels, i find they really help me relax and calm down.",
  "yes it was a great sport. i love it as well.",
  "it'll be tough but i think we'll get through it!",
  "that's a good idea, i've done that before.",
  "i am not sure. i have heard of a counsellor that provides free therapy.",
  "ah that's really good to know. is it really affecting your life right now?",
  "what is going on?",
  "i would suggest talking to someone about it and having a talk with them. they might be able to offer some advice.",
  "it sounds like you are trying hard to make her happy but you are not sure if she is really your friend.",
  "it is very hard to stay healthy and have a relationship where both sides are confused.",
  "i'd definitely suggest looking at a few things that are more important than being a consultant. for example, a mentor who is familiar with your resume and your skills and could help you find a job in your current field.",
  "i'm doing ok. what is on your mind?",
  "i've been sad too. i'll be glad to help you today",
  "i like board games as well",
  "what is it that you are feeling lost?",
  "that is great to hear. i am glad that you guys are able to work through this.",
  "i understand. i'd suggest that you try it, and see if there is anything else you could do to help.",
  "have you spoken to your friends about this?",
  "why are you sad?",
  "i think it might be a good idea to get a friend to do that for you - it might make you more comfortable and even more friendly.",
  "do you think it might be a good fit for you to get another friend or family member to join you in this situation?",
  "i love the autumn leaves, but i am not a fan of the crack.",
  "i'm glad you are being kind and being kind to yourself.",
  "i hope you are able to get some help. i think that you will feel better after doing a few things that you like.",
  "i think you'll be okay, you know doug is not the issue. he will find you a better partner. you are making good decisions.",
  "i can understand how you feel. i have been in a situation like that too. it can be very difficult to be able to be honest and listen to others.",
  "so you feel that you are happy when you feel happy?",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "i think that would be a good start. the only thing you can do is to take steps to get some resolution for your anger. if it bothers you, you could take a step back and seek some counseling.",
  "it sounds like you are doing very well in your job, but there are a lot that could be wrong with your training. there are also a lot you could do in your own time too.",
  "do you have any friends or family that can help with your children?",
  "that sounds like a great idea!",
  "no problem! it was nice talking to you. i hope you find a job soon, it's a tough time right now. have a great day!",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that.",
  "are you still there?",
  "hello how are you doing today?",
  "i am glad i could help. have a wonderful day!",
  "i see, i can understand that. i had a little sister who was a teen and we had to buy her everything for her family.",
  "do you think it might be helpful to make a list of things that you can do to avoid being able or able to see her in person?",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that! what are you feeling?",
  "so, you found out about your boyfriend going to see someone else?",
  "i can see how that would be difficult. sometimes, when we're not reaching out we tend to feel overwhelmed and overwhelmed by the person's work.",
  "i'll tell you a secret. i have a son, and he's in high school. he was once a little girl. his father, he'll now be a student. his son, who is in college, is in high schoolgrade. he'sn't ready to be in college yet. but he'd be willing to help. i would say try to let him go of the anxiety and worry. i think it would help him.",
  "yes, i think that'll be a good start. i hope you feel better soon.",
  "thank you! you too.",
  "i had a daughter. i was so overwhelmed by her weight and stress that i went through a period of time where i was overwhelmed and stressled myself.",
  "i can imagine that this is stressful, what do you do for a living?",
  "i can imagine that it is difficult to get your best interest at the moment. do you have any friends that you can talk to about it?",
  "so he dropped on you for a while, but then he stopped the relationship?",
  "what happened today?",
  "have you reached out to him to see if he could help you get the assignment done and help you study for the final?",
  "have you tried to talk to your boss about how you are feeling?",
  "i think it's important to remember that we all have our own experiences. the best thing you can do is to try and see how things turn out, and if they're not fun, just don't be upset about it. i think you're a good person for having a second girlfriend.",
  "sometimes it is easy to forget a loved one but you can do it, its just that we can't remember them all the time.",
  "it is normal to feel this way. we are wired to feel good doing something we can'tact like we want to, but it doesn't work for everyone. it'll take time and energy.",
  "i had a friend who did that and he was able to publish in less than 5 000 words.",
  "what's going on?",
  "well, in the mean time i suggest taking some time to think about the things that are important to you and try to work on them. i know it can be difficult to do things like that when it is so late.",
  "my father died at the end of my life. i think it is important to remember the positive aspects of our family and their lives. do your family care for you? are they supportive of your loss?",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. i would definitely try to find a place that's cheap and not too far away.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "you sound like a very intelligent person. i wish i had that kind of insight, but i can't. i do hope you are able to find a way to move forward with your family and not just be stuck in a rut.",
  "hi there. how are you?",
  "that is a long time. i have had bosses that have acted like this in the past and it was not good.",
  "it sounds like he'd definitely not want to change the subject if he knew the truth. have you tried talking to him about his politics and how you feel about the election?",
  "it is very easy to feel like you are getting revenge on someone when you have no idea why.",
  "yes, it can be very overwhelming. is there something you'd like to talk about?",
  "i think the best thing you can do is to distance yourself from her. i think you should have the courage to talk to her about your feelings and why she decided to break up with her boyfriend",
  "i have been to many free therapy places. there are a lot of charities out there that can help people with anxiety.",
  "i understand. have you tried looking for any other type of work?",
  "yes, that would be great! you could even join a group meeting up with other people and see if they are interested in joining you.",
  "hello, how are you doing?",
  "i believe you can too!",
  "i would try to make sure they know how i feel and that i can give you a list of things that you can do to make you feel better",
  "that'd be good to know. have you tried talking to your teachers to see if they can help you?",
  "i understand that. do you have any family or friends who might be able to help out with that? or are you just a single person?",
  "do you think you can relax a bit before the exam? i know that'll help a lot.",
  "that sounds like a good start! i am sure she would understand.",
  "how are you feeling?",
  "and if you leave everything in writing, you can'ten minutes later find out what happened.",
  "you as well!",
  "you can take your time and try to just focus on yourself and let it out",
  "that sounds like a very toxic relationship. have you talked to her about it?",
  "yes, pampering is a great way to help you feel better and improve your looks. i think that is great.",
  "i used too, but it'll probably be worse than that. it'd take a lot longer to finish everything. i mean, i used up all my time on mentoring, now i'll spend it on work and school. i am not good enough to go out to a concert or even go to a movie or a movie.",
  "that sounds like a great idea!",
  "oh yea, i remember when i was younger i worked for a company that was hiring, and they were closing down so crazy",
  "well that'd be a good start. i think we all have to start somewhere.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have you tried to talk to them about the issue?",
  "you'll be fine, i've been there before.",
  "absolutely! i hope you have a great holiday season and i wish you all the best!",
  "i do know that there are many places out there that are hiring for your needs, i think it would be worth looking into.",
  "i think that would be a good place to start.",
  "i understand. it's hard to keep in touch with people when we're all at home.",
  "i've been there myself. it can be hard when you're trying to find someone new.",
  "i can understand why you feel isolated.",
  "maybe, just maybe, he might want to be honest with you. you are in a tough spot right now and it is hard to get through, but you are doing your best to help each other.",
  "i've been there myself. it's a very difficult time for everyone. we all have issues in our lives and we have to work hard to change them.",
  "so you want to know more about the course and the subject?",
  "that'll be a great start. i would definitely encourage you to reach out to them and see if they could give you some support.",
  "you should definitely look into that! they are always helpful.",
  "oh, that does not sound good. i've had to deal with that before myself, especially since my husband was the main parent.",
  "i can understand why you are feeling that way. have you been able to talk to someone about this?",
  "you are so welcome!",
  "if you don't want to share your personal feelings just don'tgo to the video call center",
  "well, it sounds as though you'd like to have a conversation about this and try to figure out how to help her process the emotions.",
  "you just have to be patient, i know the pain of this virus will pass but just know that it is not the end of the world",
  "yes, i think that's the best thing to do.",
  "good afternoon, what is going on?",
  "i am not sure if you have a plan, but you could make a list of the jobs you would like to do and submit it to the resume agency.",
  "yes tell him what happened and see if he is willing to do it",
  "i hope that i was able to help! i wish you the best of luck!",
  "i've been there too, it's a really difficult time.",
  "if you really want to talk to him, i would definitely go to the grocery store or a grocery store to see what they are doing to make sure you get enough food.",
  "i understand. i'm in the same boat as you. i don't know how long it will take, but i would love to get a vaccine soon.",
  "i have found that a lot of people are able to provide for their child through social services and by themselves.",
  "i hope that i was able to be of some help. i am very glad i could be of assistance.",
  "of course! i hope everything goes well for you!",
  "it might be a good place to start.",
  "i can imagine that must be a stressful situation. do you think that she's a good friend?",
  "i think that talking to a professional is the best way to help you get through this.",
  "i think you're doing the right thing.",
  "you're very welcome!",
  "i am happy i could be of some help. im glad i was able to help.",
  "that's a good idea, and i think it would be beneficial for you to keep in touch with people who are dealing with the same issues.",
  "hi. what's going on with you?",
  "that'd be great! i think mturk is really great at keeping you busy.",
  "i understand that. i have two kids and i completely understand the frustration that it makes.",
  "have you tried looking at jobs in your area?",
  "you could try to talk to your friend about how you feel about the virus. it is important to have a safe space for people who are suffering from it.",
  "i'll bet you have a really good handle on it.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. is it affecting your relationships at all?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i hope you are able to get some support now.",
  "i used to feel the same way about my job and my coworkers.",
  "it is important to remember that we are all here for you, and that you can do your best to keep yourself busy.",
  "what is your main priority in life?",
  "it sounds like you are doing the right thing. i don't think that'd be the case at all.",
  "i am good. just waiting for my kids to be asleep. i am glad you are having a nice day though!",
  "ok.. so you're male..?",
  "have you tried looking for work at a local job agency or online job center?",
  "i understand that feeling. i also have struggled with that myself. what is your problem?",
  "i've had to deal with people who were so stubborn and stubborn that i found it hard to be patient with them. i hope that you can get through this, and i wish you all the best!",
  "i think you should try to work hard at your job and keep your head up.",
  "if you feel that the people you have to talk to are sympathetic, i would say that is worth a shot.",
  "i am sorry to hear that - it is certainly a terrible year. but i believe you can get through this.",
  "riya! thank you riyah!",
  "i am so sorry for your loss.",
  "i've been there with my daughter. she doesn't like sharing and i know it can be hard to be around someone else.",
  "i understand how you are feeling. do you have a support system available in your area? i know you are able to support yourself through this.",
  "i understand that. it is a hard time to think about a relationship.",
  "it is a very difficult time, but i think it will get better. do you feel that you can take a break now?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i've been in a similar situation myself. i can definitely understand how difficult that must be.",
  "is it cold where you live?",
  "oh no, that is a lot of money. what are you currently doing for the extra time being?",
  "i understand that you feel trapped and would like to move but that is ok. you can try and reach out for support to your loved one and your friends. i know it is hard but you are trying your best.",
  "ok bye",
  "you too!",
  "it will help you feel better. remember that you are doing the best you can, and that is all that matters.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "i would suggest taking it down to upper managmanager and see what happens.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, please let me know if i can help you",
  "what is going on?",
  "i am so glad! i hope that i was able to help.",
  "have you thought about getting a new job?",
  "i am doing well, how may i help?",
  "can you tell me what happened?",
  "that is very understandable, as a former employee i am sure you are aware that your manager is not going to want to be involved in a situation where you don't feel comfortable.",
  "i have had some breakups before and found them to be helpful. it'll take time to get over them, but you can do it.",
  "i think the best way to approach this is to let them know that you care and that you can talk to them about the issue.",
  "i am waiting for mine to arrive.",
  "i completely understand. i have also been in a similar situation before, and it was a lot harder. i was able to get through it, but it was also hard at the time. i think you have every right to feel like that.",
  "do you have anyone who can help you with your bills?",
  "thanks for talking!",
  "is there anything else bothering her?",
  "yeah i understand how you feel. it has been a long time. i've been in prison myself for over 10 years now and i'll never forget the horrible things i went through.",
  "i understand, i have a friend who lost her job recently and it really helped her.",
  "i'm so glad to hear that!!",
  "i can understand why you are scared, covid has been going on for a while",
  "i see. i understand. i have been in a similar situation when it comes to money and i have found that i have had to use a lot of savings to keep my job.",
  "that'd be great! i think that'll be a great start, if you want.",
  "have you talked to your manager about your frustration with her? sometimes it helps to let her know how you feel about your situation.",
  "of course! have a great day!",
  "i've been through a few of these and it has been very stressful.",
  "i think that you should be able to talk to her and see her everyday, but not only every week.",
  "hello how are you?",
  "oh wow. i can understand how that feels especially with all the uncertainty and all the changes.",
  "i think you are doing your best and i think that you are capable of doing your research and continuing to be successful.",
  "my day is very low but i can still feel my feelings",
  "bye",
  "you are welcome!",
  "skillsharing is very useful.",
  "have you tried setting it so that you can hear sounds?",
  "it sounds like they don't agree on a lot of things.",
  "it sounds like you are feeling a little overwhelmed. have you thought about getting some help from someone in your personal life?",
  "i understand how you feel. sometimes talking to people can help. have you ever tried getting your hands on a mindset to help with stress relief?",
  "i am still here. i hope that i have been able to be of some assistance.",
  "i have done it and it worked for me. maybe you should try it? you need to see your ex",
  "i can understand how frustrating that can feel. have you tried reaching out to your supervisor?",
  "oh ok. i am sure they have a car pool. there is also a harry house house that you could look at. it is owned by harry -",
  "what's going on?",
  "she will also have a list of places to apply for and get an updated resume",
  "i think that would be the best solution.",
  "i would say that you need a place to be that you can find your peace and happiness in.",
  "that's a tough situation. sometimes people just need to vent, and it's important to make sure that everyone is listening.",
  "i hope you have a wonderful year ahead of you. have a good day!",
  "i can definitely understand how that would make you feel frustrated and sad. it's a hard situation to face, but i know you can get through it!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. medication does not always work for everyone. medication has made some people feel more comfortable with their emotions.",
  "that's a long time. i've been doing it for almost 20 years and it still seems to be working!",
  "you too!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i know this is not something to be proud of, but i have been in that position before.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. what makes you think this is the case?",
  "you have to be strong! i think you have a great future ahead!",
  "you're right! you'll get through this!",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i am sure you are feeling good about yourself.",
  "yes, i try to prioritise for the time being and the effort i put into it.",
  "so you are in georgia?",
  "i am sorry to hear that you are suffering from depression.",
  "i can understand how that feels. it's very frustrating.",
  "i think that you should be honest and firm with her. you have a great heart and are very mature about it. it is best to be firm and firm.",
  "i think it was brene blue.",
  "it really does. i think that it'll get worse sooner than later.",
  "it is good that he has been locked up. he is the one who needs to get clean and help others.",
  "i can understand how you feel. it'll be hard to see yourself as the victim when people aren't understanding. i think you should try to have some sort of support from your therapist and see if they can help you with any other issues.",
  "it sounds like you are feeling a bit down.",
  "i would say that you should move as soon as possible. i think you should do it.",
  "i've been in that position before and i found out that i had to quit because of my coworkers. i found that i was better off without them. i did get a promotion and was able to pay my bills with my extra cash.",
  "you are really being supportive, i am sure you all have a great christmas season",
  "do you have any hobbies or interests?",
  "it is true that there are ways of connecting with them through video chat or in person.",
  "i would say try to find another job if you can. i think that is important to keep your mental health safe.",
  "i think you should seek professional help from a professional!",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "it was nice to get to talk with you, i hope everything works out for you.",
  "it'll be okay, it'd be nice to have someone to talk to, i think that's the best way to start.",
  "thank you, you seem like a very mature person who is willing to take the time to try and learn about things that are hard to learn. i hope you have a wonderful day!",
  "i understand that you feel like you need to put your feelings and mental health first.",
  "i can tell you are very anxious about this.",
  "i have had a lot of problems with my ex's, but it is okay. i still try to try to make it work.",
  "of course, i would be happy to help",
  "you should never be ashamed of your daughter. this is not something that you should ever do.",
  "i understand, that is the worst part about facetime. i can relate. i have also found that meeting new friends is very helpful and avoids the temptation of sharing personal information with anyone else.",
  "i am sure you have tried to communicate with him and i can tell that is not a good situation to be in. i have been in a similar situation and found it helps to talk to him about it.",
  "i think that it may be because you are not getting the hang of it, i can tell by your responses that you are very worried.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what has happened lately?",
  "exactly, it'll make you feel better and you won't have to worry about what other people think of you.",
  "have you ever thought of finding a hobby that you really enjoy? like reading, or doing crafts?",
  "have you been able to get any hobbies?",
  "i can understand that. i have had classes that were really hard to focus on, but luckily, i had a good friend who helped me get through them.",
  "do you think that he might be looking for a new friend?",
  "i can understand how anxious you are and you should be prepared for the worst.",
  "you should definitely tell your boss and let him know how you are looking forward to it. also, i know that it might be helpful for you to take a walk and take some time off from your job, since it can be really hard to get out of your comfort zone during this time.",
  "do you like any other things?",
  "have you talked to your boss about the problem? sometimes, covid can help us to identify the problem.",
  "if you are a decent friend, then you should be able to let them know how you are feeling.",
  "oh i see. do you think he was being toxic towards you or just your relationship?",
  "yes, declution is a very hard thing to start, especially if you are feeling overwhelmed.",
  "i have done a lot for my family, i'm a stay at home mom, i love my family and my best friends. i have found that helping others helps me too",
  "what about your friend is causing you to feel this way? is he being a jerk to you?",
  "so, you are being judged by other people and not by yourself.",
  "it was! i am glad that i could help.",
  "it is so hard to lose a pet.",
  "that sounds like a good idea.",
  "i've found that accomplishing new goals is a great way to make yourself feel better.",
  "you are so welcome. i hope i have been able to help you with some things.",
  "hi! how are you doing today?",
  "i understand how it feels to be treated that way. have you talked to your boss about how he is treating you and how you feel?",
  "why do you feel that way?",
  "i think that you are so brave for wanting a cat. i have a cat and i love him a lot, and he is a great companion.",
  "so you feel as though you are having to wait for them to be back home?",
  "i understand. it is tough. i have had to go through this many times in my life.",
  "i'd love to visit pennsylvania sometime, but i'll have to get out of here as soon as possible. i can't wait for the holidays to start.",
  "that sounds really painful. how did you get hurt at work?",
  "you too!",
  "do you have any hobbies or activities you enjoy doing?",
  "i completely get that. part time work is tough, but you have to keep your head up! i've been in this position before and it really helps.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what seems to be the problem?",
  "have a nice holiday season and enjoy your holidays",
  "try to be relaxed and take some deep breaths. try to do something that makes you happy.",
  "i can imagine it has been hard. what kind of work did you do before you quit your previous job?",
  "sure, is there anything specific you would like to talk about?",
  "ah i see, so he'd be doing online work but not in real time?",
  "have you considered seeking professional help for these feelings?",
