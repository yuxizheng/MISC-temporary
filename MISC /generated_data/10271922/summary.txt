EOS 0 0 24 im not sure if i can, but i dont want to live in constant paranoia of him  EOS 0 0 25 im just so lost  EOS 0 1 26 [Self-disclosure] I can understand where you are coming from. I have been in that situation myself and it is not an easy place to be. For me, it took some time to accept that I deserved better than someone who didn't just want me. Is that how you feel?  EOS 0 0 27 kind of  EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Understandably so. I believe that this is just temporary and you will be amazed at how strong you are.  EOS 0 0 29 you think so?

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hi there, I'm struggling to be honest.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] What are you struggling with?  EOS 3 0 3 I've been finding it really hard to motivate myself to do anything for the last year or so, but it's been getting worse recently. Everything feels like hard work.  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] To be honest, I feel the same way sometimes, too. It is nice to have someone to talk to about this. Have you talked to anyone else about this yet?  EOS 3 0 5 I haven't really, I feel like other people have their own issues and I don't want to burden them. It's good that others feel the same. Do you have any advice on what makes you feel better?  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Yes. I agree. For me personally, I noticed if I think back of a time before I lost my motivation, sometimes it helps me to reenergize a bit.  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] What have motivated you in the past?  EOS 3 0 8 Hmm, I'm finding it hard to remember a time I didn't feel like this! I feel like this has been going on forever! I used to enjoy walking, and generally getting things done around the house. I am also self employed and loved putting time into my business but I've been finding that hard recently.  EOS 3 0 9 I've been watching a lot of Netflix and youtube and not doing much else.  EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have been spending a lot of time home by myself as well.  EOS 3 0 11 How do you cope with it? How do you not get bored and restless?  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I noticed if I try to adhere to a schedule, even a very simple one, such as getting up at a certain time, making breakfast, and showering. My days tend to go better.  EOS 3 0 13 I've been finding I have a lot of time alone with my thoughts recently.  EOS 3 0 14 That's a good idea, I could try that. At the moment I get up at around 11am but U have been trying to get up earlier but I just can't make myself do it. I've also been sleeping during the day which is maybe not good.  EOS 3 1 15 [Question] Have you tried reading? I find reading motivates me sometimes, too. Sometimes too much thinking alone leaves me digging a hole for myself.  EOS 3 0 16 I used to get a lot of pleasure from reading and would always have a book on the go. Now reading feels like a chore, as if I am making myself do it.  EOS 3 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I sometimes force myself to exercise when I get sleepy when I shouldn't be tired during the day. 
[reference_response]	i sometimes force myself to exercise when i get sleepy when i shouldn't be tired during the day.
[hypothesis_response]	yes i'd agree. i would like to think that reading is something that i would be able to do, but i don ; t know if that'd be possible.

[contxt]	0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it's really a terrible time. you are definitely not alone in feeling that way. Is there something specific going on?  EOS 0 0 4 lately there has been a project at work in which extra help is required. the volume of things i have to take care of has increased, and my manager doesn't seem to care  EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] Is there a way you can write down in an email why the extra work is required and what specifically needs to get done in order to make this project successful for both you and your manager?  EOS 0 0 6 i have sent her a spreadsheet showing how the project has increased my workload, but she brushes it off.  EOS 0 0 7 it sucks that i'm working so hard and yet my paycheck does not support my basic needs.  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I have had managers like that. It's so frustrating. Is there a way you can have an in-person meeting and show her how extra help will make HER look good? Otherwise what I've done in the past is go over my immediate manager's head - or called a meeting with 3 of us.  EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I have had managers like that. It's so frustrating.

Otherwise what I've done in the past is go over my immediate manager's head - or called a meeting with 3 of us.  EOS 0 0 10 that is a very good idea  EOS 0 0 11 maybe it is time to include her manager  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel for you because I've been there and I completely understand how you feel. And yes including HER and her manager won't make her feel as though you're going behind her back.  EOS 0 0 13 the other thing that has become an issue is her ridiculing me in front of others  EOS 0 0 14 there have been a number of incidents in which she has singled me out, and it has left me feeling disrespected  EOS 0 1 15 [Question] ridiculing you how? that's never ok  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you have every right to feel upset about that.  EOS 0 0 17 i have reached out to HR regarding these incidents but they seem to be uninterested  EOS 0 0 18 i no longer want to come to work but i don't have a choice  EOS 0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I wonder why HR isn't interested. Have you put it in writing? No one likes a paper trail that isn't acknowledged.  EOS 0 0 20 i was vague with my initial contact to HR  EOS 0 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] that has to be a horrible feeling to be in such a hostile work environment. do you have coworkers who would be willing to back you up?  EOS 0 1 22 [Information] there's definitely power in numbers!  EOS 0 0 23 maybe, i'm not sure. it feels like everyone is afraid of my manager but yet no one will speak up  EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] if it's really that bad is there a way to get a transfer?  EOS 0 0 25 i have considered it, but due to the pandemic, everything is on freeze  EOS 0 1 26 [Reflection of feelings] yes and that just makes things so much worse.  EOS 0 0 27 i'm withdrawing from the work and that's bad. i still care about the work, but the toxic environment is messing with me mentally  EOS 0 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] maybe seek out someone more senior in a different department who can help  EOS 0 0 29 that's a good idea!  EOS 0 1 30 [Self-disclosure] When I had a toxic manager I went in and did my work and kept to myself as much as possible. But it does help to have allies throughout the company too!

I use it myself and it's very helpful!  EOS 0 1 27 [Information] There are lots of Youtube videos that show you how to use them.  EOS 0 0 28 I've never heard of it and I don't know what that is.

I was working at a bookstore at minimum wage for 2 years so I totally understand where you are coming from and had coworkers that also had kids.

EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me.

[contxt]	0 0 10 I've tried to talk to him about the control issues, but he doesn't listen. He doesn't know I'm planning to leave and I think he'll try to stop me  EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I have worked at a domestic violence shelter before, the most dangerous time to leave a situation like this is when you leave. Do you have a plan in place?  EOS 0 0 12 I have some leads on apartments and some savings I'm putting aside, and a friend I plan on living with  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] My husband used to be very controlling as well, I dragged him to counseling. He changed. He bucked at first, but eventually he went. We have gone a few times off and on over 20 years. We both came from broken homes.  EOS 0 0 14 I haven't got 100% of the details worked out yet, but I'm trying  EOS 0 1 15 [Question] Has he hurt you physically? or is he mainly emotionally abusive?  EOS 0 0 16 He hasn't hurt me physically  EOS 0 0 17 I often feel like he would but I'm also a child abuse survivor so it's hard to tell if that's true or just a memory  EOS 0 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] I'm glad to hear that. I can understand that you would be really stressed at this time, however, I do encourage you to get a good plan in place, and definitely get counseling.  EOS 0 0 19 I think that's the best idea  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I had child abuse in my life too, I really think counseling saved our marriage, 3 times. But like, I said, he didn't want to go. However, the first time, I did leave and stay with a friend, and that convinced him I was serious.  EOS 0 0 21 that's a good thought, I wonder what he'd do if I stayed with a friend  EOS 0 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I wish I could fix this, but I can't. The road will be rocky and I don't know how I would have made it without people to encourage and support me, so I'm glad a friend is willing to have you stay with them until you can get on your feet.  EOS 0 0 23 hey may not realize I'd leave at all  EOS 0 0 24 me too, that's making all the difference  EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] My husband really loved me, but coming from a broken home, he lost his mom when he was 12, so he thought controlling me was the solution, very messed up, but he had to learn to see that.  EOS 0 0 26 definitely that makes sense  EOS 0 1 27 [Self-disclosure] He feared I would die or leave him or something, but once he saw that, and realized what he was doing was hurting me and making me want to leave, he changed. But honestly, I have never understood men and why they dont' see life the way we do. Sometimes it takes that objective person to help them see it.  EOS 0 0 28 I'm not convinced mine loves me, looking back it's beginning to seem like he was draining me for my income and labor  EOS 0 1 29 [Reflection of feelings] Ouch! That sounds painful to look at.  EOS 0 0 30 it is, I think I was super wrong about him and overlooked red flags  EOS 0 1 31 [Information] People who truly love others become willing to change. Sometimes it takes a DRASTIC measure to wake them up, like leaving. He has not heard you, so many he will "hear" it when you leave. But please be careful and have a plan.  EOS 0 1 32 [Question] How long have you been married?  EOS 0 0 33 eight years, together for 11  EOS 0 1 34 [Others] That's a long time. I will say a prayer for your safety and for you to get some help, hopefully he will join you. Marriage is a lot of work, but it can't be one person, it has to be two.  EOS 0 1 35 [Providing Suggestions] Don't leave anything in writing around until after you leave. 
[reference_response]	don't leave anything in writing around until after you leave.
[hypothesis_response]	i understand, it'll take some time for him to accept you. but i've been married for 10 years and he's not the one!

[contxt]	6 0 1 I do not know what to do. I feel like shit.  EOS 6 1 2 [Question] Okay try not to worry. Can you tell me a bit about why you feel so bad?  EOS 6 0 3 I got kicked out of the home I was living in.  EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Wow I am really sorry. Were you living with family, or with friends?  EOS 6 0 5 I lived in a rented room.  EOS 6 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you were thrown out from a place you were renting? Did you do anything wrong?  EOS 6 0 7 No. The renter said he just wanted me out. He also charged me ninety extra dollars.  EOS 6 1 8 [Information] Wow that is illegal. Do you know that there are organisations that can help you with this sort of thing?  EOS 6 0 9 No. I did not. I asked my exboyfriend at the time for advice. He just say to pay him and move.  EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that was bad advice to be honest. I think that you are being ripped off. Do not worry, there are things that you can do about it!  EOS 6 0 11 That is reassuring. I would like action to be taken for justice.  EOS 6 1 12 [Question] You are definitely entitled to it. Do you have somewhere else to live in the meantime?  EOS 6 0 13 I have a couch to crash on. Another guy said I could store my furniture in his basement. But no official room.  EOS 6 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] It's a precarious position to be in, especially during a pandemic. Do you have any family members who might help?  EOS 6 0 15 Yes, I could call my mother. She has a room to stay in. But I only have the money to drive to her home, not the money for a rental truck to move all my stuff.  EOS 6 1 16 [Question] Would any family members be prepared to loan you money or a vehicle?  EOS 6 0 17 I could ask my aunt to use her car, she has an SUV, where as I drive a sedan.  EOS 6 1 18 [Others] How much stuff do you have that needs to be moved?  EOS 6 0 19 Queen bed, bed frame, small desk, roll chair, bookshelf, rug, boxes of kitchen stuff, etc.  EOS 6 1 20 [Self-disclosure] Try not to worry too much - I was in this position once myself and it did all turn out for the best though it was very scary at the time.  EOS 6 0 21 Yes, I feel almost numb from the depression. Like non of my stuff matters, only that I am physically safe.  EOS 6 1 22 [Others] I think it would be a good idea for you to try and get medical help for your depression.

[contxt]	7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well.  EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you'd like?  EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material...  EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study!  EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted.  EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version.  EOS 7 0 6 Wow, that's actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me.  EOS 7 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Don't worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don't have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot.  EOS 7 0 8 That is true. I will reach out to her now.  EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure you will do just fine, you can do it!  EOS 7 0 10 I still have some self-doubt given that I have failed an exam in the past...  EOS 7 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam.  EOS 7 0 12 I really appreciate this advice. I am feeling better about the exam and feel like I should envision myself passing and doing well.  EOS 7 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, thats the spirit it works for me!  EOS 7 0 14 I will give it a try!  EOS 7 1 15 [Others] Okay is there anything else I can help you with or should I let you go?  EOS 7 0 16 No, I should go study now. thank you for your help.  EOS 7 1 17 [Others] Of course anytime, have a goodnight!  EOS 7 0 18 You too!  EOS 7 0 19 Wait! I have another concern.  EOS 7 1 20 [Question] Yes, what is that?  EOS 7 0 21 Do you have any tips for staying cool under pressure while I am taking my exam?  EOS 7 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I do actually. First make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best. Next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings. Take it easy and do not rush. Just one question at a time, next thing you know its over.

[contxt]	4 0 1 Hi. Yes, I'm having a hard time because last year my dad died a few days after Christmas.  EOS 4 1 2 [Others] Oh I am so sorry! Dealing with bereavement is hard at any time but at this time of year I think that it is even worse.  EOS 4 0 3 When people ask about Christmas plans, I don't want to depress everyone. But I can't pretend everything's okay.  EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] So you feel as though you have to avoid people because you do not want to make them feel bad that you are feeling bad?  EOS 4 0 5 I don't know... I know my friends would be supportive. But then I feel like it's selfish of me to bring people down, when this whole year has been a downer for so many of us.  EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Well let me ask you - if the situation were reversed, would you feel that a close friend was bringing you down if they talked about their bereavement?  EOS 4 0 7 Maybe, but I wouldn't mind that.  EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Well, perhaps your friends would not mind you confiding in them either? That is what good friends are for, ultimately. 
[reference_response]	well, perhaps your friends would not mind you confiding in them either? that is what good friends are for, ultimately.
[hypothesis_response]	i can understand why you would feel that way. i think if they were talking about their own bereaver, it would be hard to take them seriously.

EOS 4 0 4 she has addictions and is living a very dangerous life  EOS 4 0 5 which makes me sad and anxious and angry all at once  EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is nerve wrecking. Did you try to comfort her and tell her that you are there to help her out.  EOS 4 0 7 yes, often  EOS 4 0 8 but she won't go for help, so i have had to be exceedingly patient  EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I love your patience level and would like to keep it going.  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Patience is the key and she will understand eventually. She will be ready to take help.  EOS 4 0 11 i will but it's such a heavy burden to carry. i try not to think about it much, but I carry it, you know? I Hope you are right about her wanting help eventually  EOS 4 0 12 in the meantime I don't know how to be so sad about this, maybe there is no way  EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] I understand your heavy burden however some kids face these problems and we as parents guide them so that they come out with flying colors.

EOS 0 0 2 I found out I'm losing my job on January 1.  EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You lost your job? thats a tough situation. Is it due to covid?  EOS 0 0 4 No, not due to covid. It's a gig job, much like mturk, but the company is dropping people from my state on that date.  EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know its tough especially with the holidays and all. You have so many great skills and are such a hard worker I dont think you will have a problem at all finding something different.  EOS 0 0 6 I've been looking at other companies, but learning a new system after all these years is difficult.  EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I remember a time I lost my job and felt my whole world crumbling but then I realized when one door closes another door opens. when those doors close it seems that its usually for the best because it opens the path for something bigger and greater for you.  EOS 0 0 8 That's true. I've thought about looking into new fields.  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Have you looked into some evening classes or maybe online schooling? I hear there are so many different options when it comes to online learning.  EOS 0 0 10 I was looking into that last night, but with covid, classes have had to cut enrollment and are already full for next semester.  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] They are full? well what about surrounding towns? Have you sat down and really thought about your passions and what you enjoy doing? Maybe theres an elderly person who needs some companionship or something like that in town for the time being.  EOS 0 0 12 I don't have a car, so I'm stuck doing classes locally. I think I'll just have to wait for the next semester.  EOS 0 1 13 [Question] Is waiting until next semester something your willing to do? That would give you time to reflect on yourself and your future and figure out what you want to do as a career. I could give you a list of other online opportunities to make money if you would be interested.  EOS 0 0 14 I would be interested in that, thank you.  EOS 0 1 15 [Others] your welcome. There are a lot of online options out there. That may be easier for you at the time being without a car. Do you have a support system of family or friends around here?

EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That's a long time. He's lucky to have you to support him. You said you worry when he's not at home. Is this because of the injury and not acting like himself?  EOS 3 1 7 [Information] Supporting someone with a brain injury can be stressful. Are you taking are of yourself as well? You can't be of help to your boyfriend if you are not doing well yourself.  EOS 3 0 8 well yes but no, he got in a car accident on 9/6/2018 and i fall pregnant exactly a year later my due date was 9/4/2019 but i had her 8/22/19 and  EOS 3 0 9 i was going to say alot more but it wouldnt let me so i copied it but it wont let me paste it so im not even going to try to type all of that up agin lol  EOS 3 0 10 but long story shot he cheated on me a half a year after i had my daughter and now the girl is pregnant wanting me to take in her child bc its either her life or the babys and me being the person i am i ant let the baby go into foster care or my baby not being able to see her sibling  EOS 3 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] If I understand this correctly your boyfriend cheated on you after you had a child together.

EOS 4 1 2 [Providing Suggestions] I am sorry to hear that - how about reaching out to any family members?  EOS 4 0 3 I have my husband, but with COVID he's the only person I've really had interactions with lately. He's great, but it's just not the same as having a friend to turn to. I feel every time I reach out to the friends I do have they are too busy with their families to talk.  EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel a lot of people are in your situation especially with Covid going on. Do you connect with friends on social media at all (like facebook)?  EOS 4 0 5 Yea, I do comment on their social media and follow up with their lives there. I do not actively post about my own life because we have been extremely cautious with covid as I am high risk, so we don't even go grocery shopping. I think I am just feeling fatigued of being stuck inside, which makes me feel sad about everything else.  EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] I can totally understand where you are coming from. I think it is great that you are at least getting a little communication with facebook. I am guessing you will be in line for a vaccination also in the up coming month which I think will help your mood as well.  EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I am awaiting my turn for the vaccine and I am very much looking forward to getting it so I can get back to some normalcy. I miss being able to go shopping or sitting in a coffee shop. These activities helped me in the past, so I look forward to being able to get out and do them again. I used to visit my friends too and we'd have lunch or coffee at their house, but obviously I haven't been able to do that lately. I will be able to once I get the vaccine.  EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I was able to get my first dose of this vaccine this past Sunday. I was very surprised how good I felt this week like a weight being lifted off my shoulders. I work with high school kids so it was nice not thinking about covid all the time. I not it might not help for you today but I think it will give you something to look forward as you move forward in the upcoming weeks.  EOS 4 1 9 [Others] *I know  EOS 4 0 10 That's so exciting for you! I am hoping I will be able to get mine in the coming weeks. I've definitely been looking forward to getting it. I decided a week ago that I would get a puppy as a companion. So I am looking forward to that, but he will not be coming home until the beginning of May. But you're right I need to look forward to the things that will bring me happiness even though it's hard right now.  EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Absolutely. The weather seems to be getting nicer as well. Do you like any outdoor activites (ex. walking outside)? 
[reference_response]	absolutely. the weather seems to be getting nicer as well. do you like any outdoor activites ex. walking outside )?
[hypothesis_response]	i'm sure it will. i also have a dog and he is my first love. it is amazing to see the little ones grow up and be able with us!

EOS 0 0 2 I do have an idea about it but I am anxious about choosing wrong and boxing myself into something I wish I hadn't chosen  EOS 0 1 3 [Providing Suggestions] Even if you chose wrong, you will generally have plenty of time to make up your mind and choose something that you really like : ), plus, you can reach out to academic advisors, for example.  EOS 0 0 4 I suppose you're right, I think I don't have confidence in myself that what ever I do choose, I will be good at it. Good enough to make a life out of it.  EOS 0 0 5 fear of failing myself because i lose interest in things over time  EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently.

It's normal to get bored of things even if we really liked them at some point  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Of course, some topics like those are more serious, but as I said, even if you chosed wrong ,you can always change your major.  EOS 0 0 10 I guess thats right. All I care about is helping others so as long as the choice i make supports that then it will be fine.  EOS 0 0 11 thank you for your help  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] No problem, and it's great that you like helping others.  EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I am a firm believer that ultimately making others happy is what makes us happy.

EOS 4 0 6 The accident was Thursday February 25th but he held on until Sunday the 28th  EOS 4 0 7 He was only 26 years old  EOS 4 1 8 [Information] There's nothing that can prepare you for unexpected tragedies like this. We just have to deal with them as they come.  EOS 4 0 9 I understand what you are saying but that's the problem. How to deal with such a terrible unexpected loss  EOS 4 0 10 I feel helpless because there is nothing I can do to make her feel better.  EOS 4 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you're sticking close to your friend, although it doesn't feel like its helping.

EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over.  EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future?  EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world.  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] it's true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online?  EOS 3 0 7 Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful.  EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] it is like there's a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression  EOS 3 0 9 How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things?  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] the "little black rain cloud" people?

EOS 3 0 20 My dad and my GF's dad both have their own opinons on things  EOS 3 1 21 [Information] so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people  EOS 3 0 22 Yes.

EOS 2 0 4 So, the issue I'm having is work-related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He's also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask...but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6-foot boundary. A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills.  EOS 2 0 5 My son just turned 2.  EOS 2 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy.

[situation]	I was in a relationship with someone that took 5 years. We were planning on building a home together and he liked the idea and promised we would pull through together. I loved him so much that I would literary do nothing to heart his feeling. We built friendship for years and we had something beautiful and close to perfection. As time went on, I did not know what went wrong but he started showing disinterest in matters that concerns me . When it started we had the conversation. I was worried and he assured me nothing was wrong. I later found out with a great dismay that he was going out with one of our high school acquaintances . It really hurt the more when he told me what I thought we had was over. it shattered me emotional. He went from avoiding my calls to not wanting to see me around. it hurts me badly. As I recall this am feeling emotional because tit was a terrible period for me.

EOS 3 0 5 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March  EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Then you've definitely got a lot going for you if you're 90!

You deserve someone that's better than leaving someone because of their age.  EOS 3 0 12 I thought it would be nice to have a younger man when we got married. He eventually told me he just married me for my money, and was waiting for me to pass so he could inherit all of it. He said he got tired of waiting, so he moved on to someone else.  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] Personally, if that's how he felt, then you're better off. I know that doesn't stop the hurt you're feeling, but you are worth more than that.

[contxt]	0 0 1 Hi, I'm actually pretty stressed about an upcoming deadline.  EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You have some work related deadlines and you are worried about that. Correct me if I am wrong.  EOS 0 0 3 That's exactly right. It's a deadline for a journal that I recently submitted a paper to.  EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard, but I know you will finish it on time.  EOS 0 0 5 I know, I always get worked up about deadlines even though I rarely miss them. This one is a bit more important than usual, however. I am just so stressed!  EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It seems it must be very challenging for you.  EOS 0 0 7 Exactly! This is a big step for me in the PhD program I'm in, so it's definitely a bit more pressure than previous deadlines.  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] In such situation, I make the strategy by distributing the time and work load equally. That's how I stay energetic and motivated..  EOS 0 0 9 That's a good idea. Do you mean just do a little bit each day?  EOS 0 1 10 [Others] Take a rough estimate like how much can be done in a day. It will reduce your work load  EOS 0 0 11 Well I have 30 more revisions to address and 15 more days to complete it. So, maybe I can make a goal of 2-3 revisions each day?  EOS 0 1 12 [Information] Apparently when we start working on such project, things start coming at right place itself.  EOS 0 0 13 Thank you, you have helped me make a trajectory for how to accomplish this. Although, I am still very anxious about the difficulty.  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Don't think too much about the remaining, just focus on what you are doing presently.  EOS 0 0 15 Good idea, the present moment is better to focus on. Any recommendations on relaxation techniques?  EOS 0 1 16 [Others] Try to take shot break or do deep breathing in middle. It will help you in staying energetic and focused.

EOS 1 0 6 So she asks me to do something for her which isn't possible. Like give her a report on data that we don't have access to.

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hello  EOS 4 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Hello how is your day going  EOS 4 0 2 I guess my day is going fairly well.  EOS 4 0 3 I just got some bad news and its got me down.  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that please tell me about it  EOS 4 0 5 Well I was given a promotion at my job to take a supervisor position. The only thing that my supervisor needed from me was my 12th grade transcripts, and I'm having a hard time getting them.  EOS 4 0 6 They have given me a total of 3 weeks and I wasn't able to accomplish it .So they had to go with someone else.  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that can be flustering. Have you tried contacting your school for help?  EOS 4 0 8 So it pretty much has me down, because my other co-workers were looking for me to step up and i feel that I've let them down.  EOS 4 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to let your coworkers down but you could be honest with them and tell them what happened .  EOS 4 0 10 Yes I've tried asking the administration office and they said since its been over 10 yrs that those files are stored in another building. They went to the building and wasn't able to find it. So at this point my hands are tied and I'm screwed.  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] One thing you need to assure yourself of is that it wasnt your fault.  EOS 4 1 12 [Information] You do have some other methods available to you to get the transcripts.  EOS 4 0 13 I've done that but so many people look up to me and its just hard to for me to be there on a daily basis knowing that I had this big opportunity and that I want be able to fulfil.  EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Have you tried contacting your State or county board of education?  EOS 4 0 15 Are you saying that I do have other methods? But they have already moved forward with another candidate.  EOS 4 0 16 Yes that's who I contacted at the beginning of my search  EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The good news is your coworkers will always look up to you even if you are not in the supervisor roll.  EOS 4 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your coworkers look up to you because of the person you are.  EOS 4 0 19 Thats true in some aspect  EOS 4 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] You can still be a big influence to your coworkers without being in the supervisor roll.  EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] I think if you spent some time being a mentor to some of your coworkers you would feel better about the situation.  EOS 4 0 22 I believe that's the only positive part dealing with this situation,  EOS 4 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] Your coworkers obviously look up to you and would appreciate your leadership in mentoring.  EOS 4 0 24 Ive been a mentor 3 years out of 3 1/2 years Ive been with company  EOS 4 1 25 [Self-disclosure] Take this oppertunity to share your experience with your coworkers and reach out to your management for more training that is available to you.  EOS 4 1 26 [Information] Perhaps you can take some online classes on your own and show management that you are taking an interest in advancing in the company.  EOS 4 0 27 Thats a good ideal ill think about doing that. Thanks for your advice  EOS 4 1 28 [Self-disclosure] Your welcome I'm glad I was able to help. Is there anything else I can help you with? 
[reference_response]	your welcome i'm glad i was able to help. is there anything else i can help you with?

You are not alone. I myself lost a job not long again and it took me awhile to find a new one  EOS 3 0 9 How did you go about it?  EOS 3 0 10 What did you do before getting a job?  EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Well, I just keep appling and applying. I got down but keep at it. In the meantime I did some work for UBER, INSTACART, etc.  EOS 3 0 12 I wish I could do that. But I don't have a car I can't afford insurance for now.  EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There are other options. There is dog walking, house sitting, handy man work, etc? I'm sure you are good at things like that.  EOS 3 0 14 I do dog walking, babysitting. But as you know that really can't help with the bills.  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] No, but you never know who you are going to meat. The more people you work for, the more contacts, etc you have.  EOS 3 0 16 You're right. But I like to believe in what I actually see not what I think might happen.  EOS 3 0 17 I'll keep applying for other jobs.  EOS 3 0 18 I really need to get something better soon  EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes, you just have to have hope. I know you will find a job. You will find something better.  EOS 3 0 20 Thanks for your kind words.  EOS 3 0 21 I'll keep applying. Hopefully something good comes my way  EOS 3 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are welcome.

EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night.  EOS 4 0 4 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now.  EOS 4 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well?  EOS 4 0 6 Today was my one-year anniversary with my boyfriend.  EOS 4 0 7 He broke up with me today.  EOS 4 0 8 We were at school (our college campus), and we had a huge fight.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run.  EOS 4 0 10 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don't know what to do with myself.  EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation.  EOS 4 0 12 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately.  EOS 4 0 13 That's true, but that doesn't make me feel any better about it right now.  EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress.  EOS 4 0 15 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays.  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts?  EOS 4 0 17 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate.  EOS 4 0 18 I suppose I just need to practice more.  EOS 4 1 19 [Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind.  EOS 4 0 20 Like the Calm app?  EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma.  EOS 4 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, the Calm app is one.  EOS 4 0 23 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately.  EOS 4 0 24 What else can I do besides meditation?  EOS 4 1 25 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds?  EOS 4 0 26 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick.  EOS 4 0 27 Candles are much better for me.  EOS 4 1 28 [Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil.  EOS 4 0 29 I haven't heard of that website before. I'll have to check it out.  EOS 4 1 30 [Providing Suggestions] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships.  EOS 4 0 31 Well, I haven't been in a long-term relationship like this before.  EOS 4 0 32 My past relationships were all in high school, and they only lasted a few weeks or months at a time.  EOS 4 0 33 I really cared for this one, and we were together for so long.  EOS 4 1 34 [Reflection of feelings] I feel obligated to help during Christmas because I had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts.  EOS 4 0 35 You had a fight with your partner? I'm sorry, it's the worst when people fight over what's supposed to be something nice.  EOS 4 1 36 [Question] What was the fight over? Food? Money? Sex?

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hi. I am worried about my exams.  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Exams are a stressful time. What seems to be the problem?  EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Exams are a stressful time. What seems to be the problem?  EOS 0 0 3 I do not feel like I am properly prepared, even though I have studied.  EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can assure you that countless students including myself have gone through the trials of studying for exams and do feel overwhelmed but it passes.  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you studied?  EOS 0 0 6 I have studied. However, I still feel like I am not prepared. One big problem is that I have no quiet place to study.  EOS 0 1 7 [Information] I get it, distractions can be challenging to overcome at times. Have you thought about going to a library, or a book store?  EOS 0 0 8 I have not. Both of those are great suggestions. I wonder if I should take the time to walk to the library (30 minutes), or just continue to study? Maybe, I know as much as I can know. The anxiety is too much.  EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If it helps you study then the library may be worth the time and effort. Sometimes we can stress out over worrying about not having enough time to study. But trust the work you have done and you will know if it is enough.  EOS 0 0 10 This is very good advice. Have you completed college?  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] Yes, and it wasn't easy but with hard work, it is completely doable. And you have the power within yourself.  EOS 0 0 12 What do you think will happen if I fail this test?  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes it is not about the amount of studying, but the way you study. I like reading my textbooks and highlighting the important parts and then rewriting them so they become ingrained in me. But let us not jump the gun, you haven't failed anything.  EOS 0 0 14 Very true. Thanks for reminding me. I think I worry more about the outcome than I need too.  EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Don't forget to breathe.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hello  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How are you today?  EOS 3 0 3 Really bad. My 10 year marriage is failing. Things have not gotten better.  EOS 3 1 4 [Question] What happened?  EOS 3 0 5 That's the thing. Nothing really happened. No cheating, drugs, or abuse. I suppose the euphoria has worn off, and she just doesn't find me interesting anymore.  EOS 3 1 6 [Information] I understand how you feel. Have you guys tried spending more time with each other? Maybe going out on dates?  EOS 3 0 7 Maybe we haven't done this enough in the past. We both had busy careers. I tried initiating this last year, but without success. Maybe, I was too late.  EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Its never too late to put spice back into the relationship.  EOS 3 0 9 I hope you're right. Do you have other suggestions about how to do so?  EOS 3 1 10 [Information] Show her that your still love because by being spontaneous. Surprise her with gifts. Maybe take her on a random vacation somewhere. Have a deep conversation about how you are feeling and that you still love her and want her in your life.  EOS 3 1 11 [Information] It might take a little bit but its better to try than not to try at all.  EOS 3 0 12 I think your suggestions are very helpful. A vacation is currently out of the picture due to COVID. I want to try having deep conversations, but I don't know where to start.  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Start by talking about whats going on. Tell her how you think you guys should spend more time with her. Or that you dont want to lose her. Ask her if there is anything she might want to discuss. She maybe having issues shes afraid to talk about.  EOS 3 0 14 I think you hit upon something. She is quite hesitant in talking about issues. Do you have any thoughts about marriage counselling? We've never tried that.  EOS 3 1 15 [Information] I think that would be a good idea. Having the chance to get things out and getting more advice is always helpful. Make sure you leave any issues at common ground. 
[reference_response]	i think that would be a good idea. having the chance to get things out and getting more advice is always helpful. make sure you leave any issues at common ground.

EOS 0 0 3 Yes, me and my partner are considering breaking up as she wants to move to another state to be with her cousin and have a fresh start. I want to stay and be around my family. So that is the dilemma.  EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it sounds to me like you're experiencing stress about choosing between staying in your current relationship, or staying close to your family. Do I have that right?  EOS 0 0 5 Yes and its very hard for me to make a decision on which to choose.  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how that feels. Anybody would have a hard time deciding between those options.  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] May I ask you a question about your relationship?  EOS 0 0 8 Yes, sure  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] Compared to other relationships that you've had in the past, how strongly do you feel about this one?  EOS 0 0 10 I would say compared to every relationship I have had, this is the best relationship I have been in. Plus we have children involved.  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That helps me understand that this is quite a problem, however talking to you now I feel like you can trust yourself to eventually reach the best decision.  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Have you talked this out with your family and your partner together?  EOS 0 0 13 I think that after speaking with you, I realize the choice I must make though difficult. And yes we have talked with everyone close with us or connected.  EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How did that go? Did everybody feel like they had their voice heard in a cooperative manner?  EOS 0 0 15 I feel like everyone respected both of our wishes as they were different but everyone also offered advice and shared their experiences. Everyone was cooperative.  EOS 0 1 16 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you had a cooperative conversation, but not a very productive one, is that right?  EOS 0 0 17 Yes we listened to each other but it was still a more agree to disagree conversation. No over talking or arguments.  EOS 0 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how those conversations go, believe me we all have them. They don't seem to solve much a first, but we better off doing it than not.  EOS 0 0 19 Yes I have come to understand that we must have those hard conversations rather than avoiding it. Thanks for the talk!  EOS 0 1 20 [Others] You're welcome, I hope you have a better understanding of the problem now. 
[reference_response]	you're welcome, i hope you have a better understanding of the problem now.

[contxt]	1 0 1 My friends won't even call me half the time even though I am always reaching out to them and trying to get together. \  EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are trying to reach out to friends and they don't reciprocate as much as you'd like?  EOS 1 0 3 Not only that, they don't seem to ever call me. I am the one doing all the efforts.  EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That can be hard when friends don't reach out despite all your efforts. Have you discussed this concern with them?  EOS 1 0 5 I haven't really tried to bring it up, but maybe I should.  EOS 1 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes friends don't realize that they aren't fulfilling their end of the relationship and just need to become more aware.  EOS 1 0 7 That makes sense.  EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Do you think you might want to have a conversation with your friends and see if they feel the same way?  EOS 1 0 9 Yes, that seems to be a good idea.  EOS 1 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I've had friends in the past who didn't call and I found out later that they were having personal struggles and it wasn't anything against me.  EOS 1 0 11 I see your point. Maybe I should be asking if my friend needs anything instead of expecting so much from them. I will have to talk to them to find out what is going on.  EOS 1 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I can see it being hard not knowing for sure.  EOS 1 0 13 You make a good point.  EOS 1 1 14 [Question] Sometimes people also grow and change so relationships evolve as well. Is there something you would hope to gain from the friendship that you think could change?  EOS 1 0 15 I just would like to get some answers if I am the one to blame. I feel guilty sometimes that I should have done something differently.  EOS 1 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] I can see that being a challenge feeling guilty about whether you did something to affect the relationship. But, you sound like you are really trying to make things work and maintain the friendship.

EOS 0 1 6 [Information] Some anti anxiety medication can be addictive but if you're sensible with it you should be okay. Talk to your doctor?  EOS 0 0 7 Yes, she suggested so.

[contxt]	1 0 1 Hello. I recently broke up with my boyfriend. We'd were together for 5 years.  EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am so sorry to hear that. That can be a really hard time and problem to navigate. Five years is a really long time too.  EOS 1 0 3 It was unexpected and sudden. I found out he was cheating on me.  EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a horrible shock to hear something like that. I thank you for expressing yourself today it can be hard to share a disappointment.  EOS 1 0 5 I am really strict about lies and he broke my trust, so I felt like I had to break-up with him.  EOS 1 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have good instincts when you can face a situation and make a judgment and decision.  EOS 1 0 7 I feel like that's true but I miss him so much. Five years is a lot to just throw away.  EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, you can feel like you have invested a lot after 5 years. I can imagine you have a lot of the same friends and that can be hard too.  EOS 1 0 9 We also have two dogs and own a house together. I just don't know what to do.  EOS 1 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I can relate to on that level. When I went through a divorce I had to part with my house and pets. I went to live in an apartment and met a really nice guy next door and wound up marrying him. There can be light at the end of the tunnel.  EOS 1 0 11 I guess... I'm just not sure how to get to the light from where I am right now. I'm just so angry.  EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Being anger is valid and you have every right to be mad.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hi, i've been feeling really depressed lately and I'd like to talk to someone about it  EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is very understandable. Depression is tough to deal with.  EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Do you have specific things that are causing you sadness right now or is it an overall feeling of being sad?  EOS 3 0 4 It's a bit of everything. I've recently lost my job and I'm just really worried about how my bills are going to get paid. I feel so tired, you know?  EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I totally understand. Losing your job is a very rough thing to go through, I'm sorry that happened to you. Feeling constantly at red alert is taxing both mentally and physically.  EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] There is a concept called Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and sometimes I find it useful to think about if my needs are being met, and which is lacking. Which is to say, obviously financial security is your primary need at the moment, but there are other needs you must attend to as well, including your physical comforts.  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] In times of great stress and upheaval, there is only so much you can do. The rest is worry, a hamster running in a wheel, a huge output of energy that does nothing at all.  EOS 3 0 8 Yeah that makes sense but I've spent so much time thinking about my finances that I've sort of burned myself out  EOS 3 0 9 Like I have no energy even to be thankful for the other little stuff  EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] That makes sense. You sound emotionally exhausted.  EOS 3 0 11 Definitely, I feel like I could sleep forever but with my kids to worry about I don't have that option  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Gratitude is one of those things, I've found, that is self-perpetuating. Even if you begin by doing it robotically, eventually your mind and heart will want to be more sincerely grateful. I have in the past challenged myself to find five things to be grateful for in the morning and write them down. Whether those things are "I have hot coffee and electricity" or "I won $1000 for free", they will begin to start a small fire of joy.  EOS 3 0 13 Messages could work, I could stick them around and I guess they coudl help not just me but my little ones too because I'm sure my moods been affecting them as well  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a great idea!

EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Uniball makes really good pens that the option to switch colors on the pen, but they sell packs with different colors too. I like to use red ink for really important things, and blue for things I might think I will need later but aren't sure.  EOS 0 0 9 I think that's a really good idea for helping to improve my focus. If my notes are more eye-catching, it'll help to keep my attention when I'm looking over them again after class and trying to study. I think your suggestion of waking up earlier is good too, what time do you suggest waking up in the morning? I usually don't set an alarm and find myself rushing around before class  EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I personally wake up around 6AM and have just gotten used to it so I wake up that time no matter what. I blame the army. But, an alarm on your phone or computer can be effective. Even having someone you know that wakes up early call you can be a help, provided you are not grumpy at being woke up :)  EOS 0 0 11 I think that would really help. I sometimes have trouble waking up to my alarms in the morning too, but maybe making the ringtone louder would help with that as well or putting it further away from me so that I have to get up further in the morning to get it. Do you think those would be effective too? Or would getting a different alarm help?  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a really good idea actually!! I should try that and put my phone on the other side of the room next time I want to wake up earlier. I personally use the most annoying thing I can find as a ringtone/alarm, so that I will make every effort to turn it off but a lot of the alarm clocks you can find in stores are plenty loud and annoying.

[hypothesis_response]	i think the best way to start is just to try to do things that you feel are easy to do, like reading a book or reading a video game.

[contxt]	0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems that Covid has had a negative effect on your employment and financial insecurity is weighing heavily on you.  EOS 0 0 5 Yes that is correct, and with the job market, how am I supposed to find a secured job.  EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that feeling of insecurity, and how helpless you feel. I myself have been in the position of loss of income and financial insecurity in the past, and while it was hard while I was in the valley, I was able to walk out of it with some valuable lessons.  EOS 0 0 7 That is true, I just have to work hard for myself. I am learning valuable lessons like the idea that companies don't care about their workers, etc. Working more on myself sounds like the better option.  EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are already identifying areas of self improvement. A person with confidence in themselves and the ability to reflect and grow are promising attributes potential employers look for.  EOS 0 0 9 Thank you for all that you've done today, I couldn't get through it without you dude.  EOS 0 0 10 Thank you for your time today, hearing my concerns about the future!  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are so welcome. I know that you will succeed in your employment search as you have the skills and humility that potential employers are looking for.  EOS 0 0 12 I'll continue to keep on the lookout for new job opportunities, as well as improving myself for the long term. I appreciate it!  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] As you continue your job search, can you think of ways that you could trim your cost of living for the short term? Returning to the basics for a time could help save you money while you take the next steps with your career. Things like planning meals ahead of time, using items you already have instead of buying new, letting go of subscriptions you don't use daily or don't deem necessary.  EOS 0 0 14 I could definitely reduce my spending like going out less for fast food, cutting my Netflix and Hulu subscriptions, and prepare my own meals for the next week weeks, as I try to find a new job. This would definitely help with my concerns about income and financial security.  EOS 0 1 15 [Information] Our lifestyle seems to be all about convenience and instant gratification, I myself being guilty of wanting those as well. But I think when we strip our needs down to the basics for a while we allow ourselves to find what is really necessary, as well as what is truly important to us.  EOS 0 0 16 Very true, people definitely need to find their fitting for when things go wrong. Failure or bad events give us time to think about the important things in life, as well as our true needs.  EOS 0 1 17 [Others] And it is important to remember that everyone goes through cycles of feast or famine, and that when you are walking through a famine you yourself are not a failure. As long as you know you are doing your best to succeed under the circumstances you have been handed, you will never truly be a failure to yourself or to others.  EOS 0 0 18 Thank you, this has really helped me overcome my anxiety and fears of the events from the past year!  EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] I am so glad you have been able to look within yourself to see that you have all the resources you need to handle this period of life. You have a optimistic attitude and a can do spirit, and those will take you far!

[contxt]	1 0 0 Hey  EOS 1 1 1 [Question] How ae you feeling today? Is there anything you need to talk about?  EOS 1 0 2 I feel drained, honestly. I'd love to talk about my current dilemma in my friend circle.  EOS 1 1 3 [Question] Can you share the dilemma you are having?  EOS 1 0 4 Basically. This has happened for as long as I can remember, even back when I was a little kid. Any friend i've ever had has just used me for SOME gain. Whether that be boredom, money, or an emotional support pillow. I'm so sick of it. They'll literally ignore me for months and randomly text me for money. If i respond theyll read my messages then ignore me until they need money again. Or, they'll use me to throw alllll their problems onto me and never do the same for me. In some way shape or form- every person I become friends with uses me and throws me away when theyre done.  EOS 1 0 5 Sometimes I feel like it must be me. Maybe i',m annoying? This happens so often the common denominator is ME. But i'm friendly, im assertive, im out spoken, im kind. I don't LET people walk all over me but it seems like that;s all I attract.  EOS 1 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel under valued in your relationships because people tend to take advantage of you.  EOS 1 0 7 Pretty much. it just happens every single time. It's kind of discouraging and just makes me an angry person  EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this is really bothering you. It is good that you are talking about it though. 
[reference_response]	it sounds like this is really bothering you. it is good that you are talking about it though.

EOS 0 0 5 Right, I can't decide what I should do, should I leave my job or not.  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Do you feel as though another job might be more intellectually fulfilling for you?  EOS 0 0 7 That's a really good question. I think it would, but I'm worried I wont be any good at it.  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I understand how difficult it can be to take what might be a life changing move. I have been in that position myself. I can't tell you what to do but I can say that it worked out very well for me.  EOS 0 0 9 I don't like feeling lots of anxiety, so I feel like I want to keep doing what I'm doing. But then I don't want to miss out on this new opportunity.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Have you contemplated seeing your doctor? They might be able to help with your anxiety.  EOS 0 0 11 I haven't thought about seeing a doctor. It could help. But I also feel like nothing can help me.  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know things can feel hopeless when you're in a bad mental place but please don't lose hope. Things will definitely improve but I think you should take steps to help yourself too  EOS 0 0 13 Yes, that is it, it feels hopeless. I've always had so much anxiety over my life, I'm so sick of it. I wish I could just feel calm for a little bit.  EOS 0 1 14 [Information] I know that a very large percent of the population suffers from anxiety at some point or another. There are therapies that can help.  EOS 0 0 15 Maybe I should seek treatment, I haven't thought about doing that.  EOS 0 1 16 [Information] There are lots of different routes you can go down when it comes to treatment. Some people prefer therapy whilst others take medication, or a combination of the two.You have to find what works for you.  EOS 0 0 17 That does sound like a good idea. Since we are in COVID, I don't see or talk to anyone that I used it. So I feel pretty lonely, just going in circles in my head.  EOS 0 1 18 [Question] Do you feel as though Covid is making your situation worse than it would otherwise be?  EOS 0 0 19 Definitely. I can't see people that I used to or my parents. It really sucks. This year has been so stressful.  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] I have been having a really difficult year too. Roll on 2021!  EOS 0 0 21 I think it's hard for everyone.

Let's hope January brings better things for all of us.  EOS 0 0 23 I need to see friends and do activities. It's more healthy for everyone that way.  EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Yes.

Why are people so mean?  EOS 6 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] I do not know - there are a lot of nasty people out there. Have you tried confronting people who are bullying you and asking them why?  EOS 6 0 6 Well, with covid, it's even harder to go talk to people. So, I don't think that's a good idea. I don't have a lot of money, so I can't buy fancy clothes. I don't think I can fix it.  EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] You do not have to buy fancy clothes for the sake of other people! Maybe you could get some counselling to work on your self esteem though?  EOS 6 0 8 I see a counselor regularly. The sessions are virtual. I do wish there were some ways to figure out how to make the clothes I have look better or match better, be more organized with my wardrobe. I have a lot of problems with too many clothes that don't look good on me.  EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried shopping in second hand stores? You can often get some nice stuff there for cheap.  EOS 6 1 10 [Others] But really I think that the problem is your self esteem, not what you are wearing.  EOS 6 0 11 Yes! I love second hand stores! So I should not care so much what they say about me?  EOS 6 1 12 [Others] Right! To be honest I suspect that it's far more their problem than it is yours.  EOS 6 0 13 I agree. Those women were not even in shape. They had makeup, hair done, etc., but they were not nice women. Maybe they are just taking their problems and insecurities out on me.  EOS 6 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes I think that they were. I have had issues like this myself in the past and I know how much it hurts and how hard it is to overcome it.  EOS 6 0 15 Yes. It does hurt.

EOS 3 0 5 I have been very depressed lately.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] What do you think has been causing your depression?  EOS 3 0 7 I was raped when I was a teenager by my boyfriend and as you can see its still haunting me to this day.  EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That definitely is a very impactful event, but you've already been so strong for reaching out.  EOS 3 0 9 Thank you. I feel as if I lost who I am after that happened.  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it would be okay to allow yourself grieve because in a sense the person you were has now changed due to this event.  EOS 3 0 11 It is very hard to be in another sexual relationship after that has happened. Im not sure I will every be the same again.  EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I had a similar event where I was taken advantage of with similar feelings. I personally decided to share all my feelings with my new partner and we went very slow only doing things I was comfortable with.  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] That may be a strategy you could use to help move back into having a sexual relationship with someone.  EOS 3 0 14 That seems like a good idea. But, what if my partner doesn't have empathy for those sort of things. Im worried he will not care.  EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] In good relationships both partners have mutual respect for each which extends into their sexual relationship. Remember you haven't lost your self worth, and you deserve someone who respects you.  EOS 3 0 16 I suppose. I just dont want to burden my new relationship with my past issues.  EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your past is definitely not a burden, it's part of you, even if it's not a positive experience. By sharing your past, it would bring you closer as a couple. 
[reference_response]	your past is definitely not a burden, it's part of you, even if it's not a positive experience. by sharing your past, it would bring you closer as a couple.

EOS 5 0 5 insecure, narcissistic biological sister who a decade older than me  EOS 5 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see. Family arguments are unfortunately very common so try not to worry too much about it. Do you really need to keep this person in your life though? If you're not speaking, why not just forget about her?  EOS 5 0 7 Because I live in the same area as my parents and any get togethers we have I don't even want to go to so I don't have to see her and she has used that opportunity to turn anyone she can against me, I cut off contact back then too...  EOS 5 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am really sorry to hear this. I was in a similar situation with a family member a couple of years ago. I know how tiring it can be.  EOS 5 1 9 [Question] Have you talked to any of your other family members about this?  EOS 5 0 10 I talk to my mom and one brother about it, the other brother I have unfortunately decided to join in with the behind the scenes trash talk (only because he enjoys drama which she's full of) I never spoke much to the rest of my family anyway (they never could understand me even to a degree we could carry a conversation that isn't small talk jabber) so it's not much of a loss except for what she did today has me kind of P.O.d  EOS 5 0 11 O ur father is where she got it from  EOS 5 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] What is it that she did today? I can hear the frustration and anger you are experiencing and I hope that I will be able to do something to help you  EOS 5 0 13 Her daughter (who took more after my personality than hers) came into state and had stated she wanted to stay at her grandparents for the first few days but when she came she ended up going to her moms and when she came to the town we live in she had to bring her mom. Her mom made her to do that for whatever wacky personal issue/emotions she refuses acknowledge and it's a huge bummer because I haven't seen her about 3 years and have small children so I can't really cross country to go visit too easily  EOS 5 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] I am sorry to hear this. It sounds like she is being rather toxic. Have you considered getting professional help about this? Would she be prepared to address her issues too?  EOS 5 0 15 That's a huge H E double L lolol I don't love her or value her company enough to consider that, no. IN fact, I kind of want to solve it by beating the living daylights out of her face lol  EOS 5 1 16 [Others] Well I do not think that that would be a good thing to do. That would be putting you in the wrong.  EOS 5 0 17 Which actually almost happened when we had that silly argument back when but she called our parents and had them intervene and lie for her uuuuuugh  EOS 5 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I think that you need to just totally back away from this relationship before something really bad happens.

[reference_response]	i think that you need to just totally back away from this relationship before something really bad happens. can you try to just think that she does not exist and not obsess about her?

[contxt]	0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I can see that you are feeling a large amount of stress about the situation.  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Would it be possible to take one or more days off from work to give yourself more time?  EOS 0 0 10 Yes this is very stressful. Have you ever had a similar experience and if so how did you handle it?  EOS 0 0 11 Potentially but this is very short notice, usually I have to provide more notice for leave from work.  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I have had to deal with time pressures quite a few times. I am sure most people have in the modern era where everything moves so fast. I have usually gotten help from friends, or done my best to delay or remove other commitments from my life. As a last resort, I have sometimes had to accept that I would be getting less sleep than usual for a few days.  EOS 0 1 13 [Question] Are there any other commitments that you can possibly delay or remove from your life while you prepare for your job interview?  EOS 0 0 14 Perhaps I can ask if I can finish early from work for the next couple of days and get some time that way. I do think however I'll be more nervous due to less time to prepare. The thing is I'd delay the interview but this might affect my chances.  EOS 0 0 15 I suppose I could ask my partner to look after the childcare for the next couple of days.  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems. You seem like a hard working, diligent type of person that can make this work if you make the effort.  EOS 0 0 17 Tanks , I think I need to stay positive about this. Not sure how to handle my interview nerves however?  EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help. If you prepare as much as possible in the time that you have, you can be confident that you have done your best, and that is all that matters. You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident.  EOS 0 1 19 [Question] Do you think any of these ideas might help?  EOS 0 0 20 There are actually some great suggestions there. The naked idea is a classic and it did make me smile. I think I am aiming for perfection when I think I should try and relax and just give it my best shot. That does help actually!  EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Be confident in your abilities. You are the right person for the job, and if the interviewer does not see that, it is their failing, not yours. You will do great.  EOS 0 0 22 Thanks for that. I think the key to this is confidence so I'll go with it. Feeling more relaxed about it all now,  EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Excellent. I am very happy to hear that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?  EOS 0 0 24 No that's great. Thanks from your help  EOS 0 1 25 [Others] You are quite welcome.

[contxt]	0 1 9 [Question] What do you feel when you feel on guard and paranoid? Try to say some more about that if you can.  EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thanks, I hope the same for you.  EOS 0 0 11 I go out pretty much only when I have a purpose and personal admin/errands. I work about one or two days a week out of my home. So with the rising cases, I just feel anxious having to get out of the safety of my home. I was a lot more anxious earlier this year though. I am much more used to it at this time.  EOS 0 0 12 And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after March. My life has been on hold and I am just surprised that it's even november now, because it feels like I am still stuck in March.  EOS 0 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yeah, that makes sense. When this was all new, the uncertainty probably made for more anxiety. Now that we know some more about what is safe and what isn't, maybe less so. But it doesn't mean the anxiety is gone, of course. It's still around in our day-to-day lives.  EOS 0 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well said. You feel stuck. The usual things you would do now are just not available to you.  EOS 0 0 15 yeah I have been adjusting to it and the cases were down and even to zero in my city for most of the last few months, but there's definitely the start of a new community spread now.  EOS 0 0 16 yes correct  EOS 0 0 17 Plus there's a loss of routine or motivation. I procrastinate a lot and get lost in thought or lost without thought. I don't work out as much as I used to (inside or outside of home). I don't eat as well and my sleep pattern is not good at all (I sleep a lot later than I should).  EOS 0 0 18 So I am disappointed in myself to say the least.  EOS 0 0 19 and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive  EOS 0 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can rephrase some of this, if you don't mind. In a way, you're talking about activities that you may have used (gym, hikes, etc) to keep yourself in a good mood. Now that those don't seem available, you just don't have those opportunities to boost your mood. It makes sense that you would be feeling this way.  EOS 0 0 21 now I am more used to it of course, but this summarizes how I have been feeling for most of this year.  EOS 0 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you explained yourself really well. Thanks for sharing how you've been feeling.  EOS 0 0 23 yes you're right. That's exactly it. I think it's going to be this way for a long time. I see other people compromising and taking the risk to go out for walks or runs, and even to the gym. I could have done that for the last few months when we had zero cases for awhile, but I didn't want to gamble and compromise. And I still see those people as selfish when I choose to do what I think is right.  EOS 0 0 24 yeah no worries. It's good that you understand and thank you for listening.  EOS 0 1 25 [Question] Do you think if you went ahead anyway to the gym or out for runs that you would feel guilty for doing them? 
[reference_response]	do you think if you went ahead anyway to the gym or out for runs that you would feel guilty for doing them?
[hypothesis_response]	you'll find a way to overcome this if you take the time to put your mind to it.

I started applying for government benefits none was fast coming forth and requires a lot of processing time. I later got a part-time job that the pay was low and i could not put up with the bills .it was really tough. I almost went into depression but I did not give up home.

EOS 3 0 9 i have discontinued it already  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Okay, thank you for clarifying :-) Your frustration is understandable. Having a job while being in school can be tough, that is true. However if you are discerning you could get a job that would have flexible hours, especially if you let them know beforehand that you're planning on getting back into school as soon as possible.

[contxt]	4 0 1 I'm feeling really sad. I just found out that I was rejected from a job that I really wanted!  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am really sorry to hear that. It seems to be happening to a lot of people right now. Do you have anything on the back burner?  EOS 4 0 3 No. I've had a lot of interviews but no one seems to want to hire me :(  EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I would not take it personally - I have been struggling to find work too. I think it's the pandemic.  EOS 4 0 5 Sorry to hear you've been struggling too! I think it's just frustrating because there seems to be lots of jobs out there, but I must be giving a bad impression during my interviews.  EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Don't put yourself down! That is a really bad habit to get into when job hunting but i know how easy it is to do.  EOS 4 0 7 Interviews are so stressful, though! I can't stand the thought of needing to do more of them.  EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Have you contemplated trying temping agencies? They pay might not be great but it is enough to get you by whilst you find something that you really want to do.  EOS 4 0 9 That's a good idea. I hadn't really thought of that.  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I've done a fair bit of it before ... there are good and bad aspects. You get to go to a lot of different places but it's also difficult to make friends and get settled.  EOS 4 0 11 That does sound hard for me. I'm really shy around new people.  EOS 4 1 12 [Information] Me too. But the upside is you can pretty much choose your own hours  EOS 4 0 13 How did you handle having to work with new people all of the time?  EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] To be honest it was not all that easy. I tended to keep my head down a lot and just smile vaguely when someone made eye contact.  EOS 4 0 15 That sounds hard. I don't know if I can do that. It feels like I'll never get a job.  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] What about something that involves less physical contact? There's always gig work online.  EOS 4 0 17 I wouldn't know where to start with that. I feel like m ost "online" jobs are probably scams.  EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I work on Amazon Mechanical Turk - if you're diligent you can make a fair few bucks there. Not sure it's a living wage though but you could try it  EOS 4 0 19 I've heard of that. Thanks, maybe I'll check it out.  EOS 4 1 20 [Others] Give it a go ..you've nothing to lose but your self respect :P  EOS 4 1 21 [Others] On that note I hope I have been able to be of some help to you today!

EOS 0 0 3 I'm doing well, but it could have been better  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What seems to be bothering you tonight?  EOS 0 0 5 Yes, my boy friend of 3 years has refused to take our relationship to the next level and I'm kind of getting tired, I don't want to play games anymore  EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don't feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,  EOS 0 0 7 exactly, I hate to feel that I'm wasting my time  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand that, as I was in a long term relationship and I felt as though my girlfriend at the time did not want to take things to the next step and I was not happy about it.  EOS 0 0 9 Yes, I love him so dearly to want to settle down with him, but if he doesn't want that for me I would rather call it quits now than continue and be disappointed at the long run.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Have you had that conversation with him? I know it might be a difficult conversation to have, but it is often good to get expectations out in the open so you are on the same page with your partner .  EOS 0 0 11 Yes, sort of and he gave me the impression that he is not there yet and that was a like almost a year ago, I don't want it to look like I'm pushing him if I try to talk to him again about it. His nonchalant attitude in not seeing the seriousness of it is killing me, I'm just not happy.  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] That is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance I am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications.

[contxt]	4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How's it going?  EOS 4 0 2 I've not been doing great to be honest. I'm finding it hard to stay positive with all these constant lockdowns and restrictions  EOS 4 1 3 [Question] I can agree. There are so many places going back to where we were several months ago. Which state do you live in?  EOS 4 0 4 I'm actually from the UK. I live in the North of the country near Manchester and things are bad here right now.  EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I agree it's bad! Where I live in the US our numbers are going back up and the kids are being home schooled again. I just keep thinking this is temporary!  EOS 4 0 6 Yes I suppose it does help to think it possible not for the long term but my friends seem to be dealing with it better than I am and I'm not quite sure why it's put me in such a sad emotional state. I should just get on with it but have very low motivation  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning. With news of vaccines being introduced here shortly, that's what's keeping me afloat. Are you able to hang out with friends?  EOS 4 0 8 no not really because I'm not supposed to mix with people outside of my household. I could potentially try and meet them virtually online or on a video call is this something you've had much experience with?  EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Oh very much so! Zoom and Facetime are my best friends right now. lol I think that's one of the reasons why I snapped out of my depression is because I started doing that more since we couldn't go out and do anything.  EOS 4 0 10 Ok that's interesting so you have also suffered with depression in the past? exactly how did you get out of it yourself?  EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I downloaded Zoom around the end of May. The first two months were the worst. I had never heard of Zoom until a friend said we should have a virtual party so he organized it and there were 11 on the call. It was so much fun despite the fact.  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe organizing a "zoom party" would start to lift your spirits.  EOS 4 0 13 that's a really good suggestion. I could also catch up with friends that haven't seen for a while. I think this would definitely work to boost my mood. The only problem is being depressed isn't something that I'm familiar with. what if it goes a little bit deeper than this?  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Depression sucks I have to say! Just don't let it win. Since you say it's something you have never dealt with, you can fight it by staying upbeat and do something fun.  EOS 4 0 15 Sure, or something conversations like this help perhaps a support group would be a good idea also?  EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Start off by not being hard on yourself for feeling the way you do. Music, tv and books does it for me - and zoom  EOS 4 1 17 [Question] Most definitely. Do you have Meetup over there?  EOS 4 0 18 I've never heard of this, what is it?  EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] It's an app on mobile devices where you can (when there's no pandemic) meet up with folks who share common interests as yourself. Nowadays instead of meeting in person, they are doing virtual meetups. I do it with a book club.

I know a lot of people are worrying about their jobs because of this.  EOS 0 0 3 I think it’s partially due to the pandemic. I am struggling progressing at my company and have been up for a raise for a year now that still hasn’t gone through. It’s making me feel like they don’t value me.  EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that. So, I hear you saying that you feel you are not being valued for your work?  EOS 0 0 5 Yeah exactly. I want to feel like I am an important member of the team and right now I’m not feeling that and it makes me feel like I don’t have a future with this career anymore. But now is not the time for a career change.  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] No I guess that it isn't. Have you tried talking to your employer about this? Or even your co workers?  EOS 0 0 7 I think that’s the part that gets me anxious. I don’t really know how to communicate this to my superiors. There isn’t a lot of open communication now that we all work from home.  EOS 0 1 8 [Information] Is there someone intermediate that you can talk to ? Or perhaps could you contact a union? There is help out there.  EOS 0 0 9 Maybe going to HR would be the smart move?

EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] First of all, fixed sleep and wake times. If you toss and turn for hours, still get up at the same time.

EOS 6 0 11 I was in physical retail before  EOS 6 0 12 But now and even after the pandemic will all shift to ecommerce  EOS 6 0 13 I am not sure if I can acquire new skills  EOS 6 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You seem like a bright, open minded person.

EOS 6 0 15 My sister works for Amazon and tried to put me forward twice but just no luck.  EOS 6 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] There are still many brick and mortar stores that will open after the pandemic is over, hopefully that will bring opportunity.  EOS 6 0 17 I tried to stay hopeful.  EOS 6 0 18 how about you? why did you pick to be a supporter?  EOS 6 0 19 You are very nice by the way.  EOS 6 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Are you interested in taking any classes to improve your skillset? There are many free courses available online.  EOS 6 0 21 Yes, I used coursea and also learning French.  EOS 6 1 22 [Others] Thank you, I enjoy talking with people and helping them in any way I can  EOS 6 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow, learning french must be fun. If you can learn another language, I have faith you can learn new skills for a job. That's really great, good for you!  EOS 6 0 24 Yes, the Duolingo app is quite good.  EOS 6 0 25 I worked for a French company for 8 years, just never really get to pick up until now I am unemployed.  EOS 6 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] Learning new languages can open up new opportunities for work. It is unique to be bilingual. Make sure to put all your unique attributes, such as learning french, on your resume. It might help!  EOS 6 0 27 Thats a good suggestion, I can't really hold a conversation in French yet. But when I do, I would put that into my skillset. I don't want to fake any skills  EOS 6 1 28 [Question] Are there any other fields of work you are interested in working besides retail?  EOS 6 0 29 I know a lot of people do and basically AI are screening all the resume which I don't think I did a very good job in catering to that. But integrity is very important to me.  EOS 6 0 30 I am also close to L&D, HR.  EOS 6 1 31 [Providing Suggestions] I would recommend calling the company or searching for a contact via LinkedIn or just google and trying to make a connection there.

EOS 6 0 34 Did you pay for the premium package on LinkedIn?  EOS 6 1 35 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Earning a license for loans or for real estate sounds like a great way to add to your skillset.

EOS 3 0 14 yeah mostly working and meditation  EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] That's great! Meditation is also something I've picked up during this time. It's really helpful and can keep you balanced. Do you have a routine or do you just do it sporadically?  EOS 3 0 16 i mostly do it sporadically but i do need to do it more often  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] It's great to try to integrate it into your day. All of us tend to have at least a few moments each day to ourselves. Even if it's during a shower or bathroom break, you really can meditate anywhere! It's all about being in the here and now.  EOS 3 0 18 so true  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] When things get stressful, meditation can be difficult. Sometimes we get wrapped up so much in our emotions that trying to center yourself and focus on your breathing and the moment can be hard. One thing I've learned to be helpful when I'm stressed is to breathe in through my nose while internally counting to three and out through my mouth counting to three. The counting tends to distract my mind from whatever stressful thing I was thinking of before.

Most of my teachers just post lessons on the classroom website, and there's not a lot of guided instruction. My grades are slipping. I'm used to getting mostly A's, and now I'm mainly making Cs.

[contxt]	0 0 14 Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school.  EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal.  EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments.  EOS 0 0 17 Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break  EOS 0 0 18 I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe.  EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books.  EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing.  EOS 0 1 21 [Question] HOw man classes do you have?  EOS 0 1 22 [Others] many *  EOS 0 0 23 I have 6 classes  EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] That's a lot but it is totally doable. Here is a good example, If you plant seeds in a garden today, you have to weed it a bit tomorrow, the next day, the next day, you have to wait for rain, then weed some more, the harvest comes and YAY! You are happy. But if you lie on your bed, never planting, never weeding, you procrastinate, you get nothing.  EOS 0 1 25 [Information] If you write your classes down and then write a reasonable time to study each one. Maybe 3 today, 3 tomorrow, then add rewards if you do that, maybe make a list of rewards, so you can pick and choose, then you check off when you do the subject. Like a chore chart.  EOS 0 0 26 Yes haha. That is a good comparison. You have been super helpful. I will for sure try to use your advice. Thank you!  EOS 0 0 27 Have a great day and thanks again  EOS 0 1 28 [Others] You are quite welcome! God bless have a great day!

[contxt]	6 0 3 I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I'm too scared to do anything about it as I don't want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can't help it  EOS 6 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through.  EOS 6 0 5 Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I'm a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are.  EOS 6 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it  EOS 6 0 7 What happened out of interest when you had the conversation?  EOS 6 1 8 [Others] Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist.  EOS 6 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more. Since that time, he denies everything.  EOS 6 0 10 I know. I'm a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It's superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas 'punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends.  EOS 6 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly, its not anyone else's business. IF you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o=is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER!  EOS 6 1 12 [Question] Curiously, why do you think she's cheating?  EOS 6 0 13 I'm almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two.  EOS 6 1 14 [Question] Hmm... So have you two live together? How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation?  EOS 6 0 15 That's just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven't approached it with her because I'm scared see will just leave and I'll be a laughing stock. I suppose I'm a joke either way!  EOS 6 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There's always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations. 
[reference_response]	don't get me wrong, i completely understand why you have suspicions. really i think anyone would in the same shoes... however, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. there's always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.
[hypothesis_response]	just be honest with yourself. you both have a very strong relationship. you want to be sure that this behavior is not a problem.
[comet query]	That's just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven't approached it with her because I'm scared see will just leave and I'll be a laughing stock. I suppose I'm a joke either way!

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hello, I have been feeling very anxious and stressed recently.  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Why have you been feeling stressed and anxious?  EOS 0 0 2 I failed my first exam earlier this week and I have 2 more later on in this week. I am already disheartened about my first failure and I am scared that I will fail again.  EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure you tried your best on that test, as long as you study hard I believe you can ace those next 2 exams!  EOS 0 0 4 I have been too stressed about my other exams, it's making it hard for me to focus on studying and I don't know what to do.  EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] I've heard that meditation can help with stress and focus, maybe you could try meditating for a bit before you study?  EOS 0 0 6 I have never tried meditating before, I have no idea where to start.  EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Meditation is essentially focussing on breathing, you could start by closing your eyes and slowly breathe in an out.  EOS 0 0 8 I feel like a failure and I am scared my parents are going to be disappointed in me  EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] From what you're saying to me, I feel that you don't believe in yourself very much.  EOS 0 0 10 I guess you are right, I need to believe in myself and my abilities more.  EOS 0 0 11 I just don't know how sometimes.  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I've struggled with the same thing before, whenever I doubt myself I look back at all i've accomplished and look at myself in the mirror and tell myself that I can do it. It has worked well for me.  EOS 0 0 13 What if I fail another exam this week? I need at least an 80% to pass my class, I am so worried.  EOS 0 1 14 [Information] Psychologies studies show that spacing out your studying and relearning helps you remember more information, you could try to section off your studying and then reviewing information before the exam!

EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I used to be the same way, but I learned about how to make and keep close friends.  EOS 0 0 9 i think it feels like a problem because I never let anyone too close in order to make friends and have an external support system  EOS 0 0 10 how did you do it  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I joined volunteer groups to help others. I made friends with like-minded people who volunteered to make a difference.  EOS 0 0 12 I actually think that is a great idea. I have never thought of doing that for that specific purpose.  EOS 0 1 13 [Information] Groups like Habitat for Humanity or UNICEF will help you to build long-lasting friendships.  EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It just takes finding the right volunteer groups and being willing to be pro-active.  EOS 0 0 15 I guess it makes a lot of sense. If you go to a party or a bar, you don't know what you will get, as it is a mixed bag of personalities. Whereas if you go to something like what you suggested then you already know that the people you meet have the same kind of heart.  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can do it. I have faith that you can use volunteering as the right method.  EOS 0 0 17 Thank you for that suggestion, that is really helpful and something that I will take with me from now on.  EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Exactly, volunteering is a great option. And there are many organizations to join.  EOS 0 1 19 [Question] Did you need help with anything else?  EOS 0 0 20 I feel ok being alone mostly, but other times I would like to have people I could relate with and hang out with. Probably has a lot to do with ADHD and how I feel misunderstood or my anxiety gets the best of me in social situations  EOS 0 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I understand the ADHD. There are support groups that can help you make friends; especially with ADHD, etc.  EOS 0 0 22 do you know any specific groups?  EOS 0 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] Using tools to build houses helps to release endorphins, which can release anxiety.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Life is bad to day. My bbboyfireind just left me, I am alone in the house. I have no one to share things with.  EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am really sorry about that - you are feeling that you've been deserted?  EOS 3 0 3 Yes, that is exactly how I feel. I was deserted, I feel unlovable, like no one will ever want me again.  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Please don't think that! I have been in this situation and I know how awful it is but I also know that it will pass.  EOS 3 0 5 It doesn’t;t feel like it will pass. It feels like it will only get worse. I don’t want to go to bed alone. I won’t be able to sleep tonight.  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Would you be able to go and visit friends or family members? Get some support?  EOS 3 0 7 My family is out of town. My friends were also his friends and he told lies about me so they wont talk to me. I want to just get drunk and go to sleep.  EOS 3 1 8 [Information] Oh that is not a good idea. Do you think you have an alcohol problem? There are support groups out there who could help you.  EOS 3 0 9 I never drink alone but I feel so bad now and afraid of being alone.  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I hear you. Do you have any pets or anything at all to keep you company?  EOS 3 0 11 Do you think I should call him and ask him to come back? He took our dog.  EOS 3 1 12 [Others] I think you should get the dog back but I don't think you should call your ex - you are better off without him.  EOS 3 0 13 But I still love him. He did sleep with my best friend, but he said it didn’t mean anything. I really miss him,  EOS 3 1 14 [Others] I think you should value yourself more highly than this. If he slept with your best friend then he is nothing.  EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can do a great deal better, I am sure!  EOS 3 0 16 Thanks. You are right, I am too good for him. I had a job and he doesn’t.  EOS 3 1 17 [Others] Well quite! You can easily move forward with your life. He will not find it so easy. But do get the dog back.  EOS 3 0 18 Yeah, I need the dog. He gave it to me as a puppy for my birthday. I can’t believe he took it.  EOS 3 1 19 [Information] Do you know that there are legal organisations out there that will help you get it back?  EOS 3 0 20 But I am still having a hard time getting to sleep, I am so upset. I have been crying for hours.  EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] I suggest you have a nice warm bath and a cup of cocoa and try to relax  EOS 3 0 22 Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. A bubble bath and some warm coco.

[contxt]	0 0 13 Yea, I definitely need to get better at doing that. I end up letting them play video games and with toys in the middle of the day sometimes because I have work that I have to get done as well.  EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] For my example, my daughter very much likes to play video games. In order to earn video game time I need two successful assignments. They have to be small, reasonable tasks, but also an amount of time that allows you to take it one bite at a time.  EOS 0 1 15 [Question] I mean, think about it, how do you eat a cow?  EOS 0 0 16 That's very smart on your part. I really need to learn to actually follow through and do that.  EOS 0 0 17 That is true and a very strange reference.  EOS 0 1 18 [Others] Well, one piece at a time. I apologize for the strangeness of the reference.  EOS 0 0 19 No, I appreciate the different references.  EOS 0 0 20 I was just surprised by it.  EOS 0 0 21 One piece at a time makes more sense than allowing myself to be bogged down by everything at once when I can only accomplish one thing at a time.  EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] You can't do it all at once, and neither can he. It's not a perfect solution, but its a solution that has worked for me.  EOS 0 0 23 You've made some very good points and I just need to get better at taking things one thing at a time.  EOS 0 1 24 [Information] This is a strange new world. Sometimes we have to try strange new things to cope.  EOS 0 0 25 That is definitely true. No one could have possibly been prepared for what has been happening.  EOS 0 0 26 Covid has been disrupting so many people's lives in so many different ways.  EOS 0 1 27 [Information] I'm glad I was able to help.  EOS 0 0 28 It's just nice to be able to talk to someone else who is experiencing some of the same things.  EOS 0 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you will find that a lot of your friends are in the same place.  EOS 0 0 30 That is probably true, but everyone has been so busy that I've only really been communicating with my husband.  EOS 0 1 31 [Providing Suggestions] And that adds to stress beyond the ad-hoc homeschooling. It is important to purposefully socialize by phone or chat with friends. We humans are social creatures, and you are not an island. We all need friends. My wife has been an amazing support, but I still make time to facetime with my buddies.  EOS 0 0 32 That is a very good point and I should really try to talk to my friends more than I do.  EOS 0 0 33 Thank you for the help today. It was nice to talk to someone else.  EOS 0 1 34 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm grateful to be of help.  EOS 0 0 35 I hope you have a nice day.  EOS 0 1 36 [Information] You also.

[contxt]	4 0 3 And sleeps all the time. I just want him to feel better, but the surgery is scary.  EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh wow, i'm so sorry. That's really scary.  EOS 4 0 5 It is. And it happened so fast. He was really just fine in July.  EOS 4 1 6 [Information] It seems like he was in a lot of pain adn discomfort so surgery should really help.  EOS 4 0 7 That's what we are hoping. He was sort of stubborn about talking to the surgeon this week for advice, but finally listened to me.  EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Yeah, it really comes out of nowhere. MY mother was diagnosed with cancer last year and it felt so out of nowhere and unfair.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Good thing he has you! he's lucky to have someone like you in his corner.  EOS 4 0 10 Doesn't it? So you understand.  EOS 4 0 11 You can feel so helpless.  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I do understand. It's really hard. THe only thing that you can do is try to stay positive as cliche as that sounds.  EOS 4 0 13 I think it helps him if I do.  EOS 4 0 14 He will be in the hospital for 1-2 weeks.  EOS 4 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You aren't helpless! So much of this is mental and you being there for him is more helpful than you know.  EOS 4 1 16 [Question] Will you be able to visit him in the hospital?  EOS 4 0 17 I'm a little nervous about what kind of help he'll need when he gets home.  EOS 4 0 18 Yes! I'm so relieved, with the covid restrictions. but I can.  EOS 4 0 19 I think only one visitor at a time, but he moved her to be close to me (met long distance), so his closest friends aren't local. The ones he'd want to visit.  EOS 4 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] Thank god! That will make such a big difference for both of you. Being alone would be scary.  EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well he clearly loves you! I am happy that he's getting the treatment he needs and has someone so supportive like you helping him.  EOS 4 0 22 Thank you... it really helps to talk to someone. I worry about stressing out friends.  EOS 4 0 23 Plus sometimes, they just don't know what to say, especially if they haven't known someone who has gone through it.  EOS 4 0 24 How did your mom do?  EOS 4 0 25 If you don't mind my asking.  EOS 4 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] Your friends probably want to be there for you, don't be stressed about that. They just may need some guidance on how to be there for you .  EOS 4 1 27 [Self-disclosure] My mom is doing great! Still in treatment but doing so well.  EOS 4 0 28 OH, thank goodness. I'm happy for both of you.  EOS 4 0 29 It's just a strange year. I lost both my dogs to cancer in six months, then this. Then my cousin died of pancreatic in July. Plus some other acquaintances.  EOS 4 0 30 It's just felt like a lot.  EOS 4 0 31 Did your mom have trouble eating? And tons of fatigue?  EOS 4 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Oh wow, i'm so sorry. You've had a really tough year. You really deserve a break.  EOS 4 1 33 [Self-disclosure] She did ! Especially when she was in treatment.  EOS 4 0 34 Right, and as I bet you can relate, breaks are hard to get in COVID days.  EOS 4 0 35 that's what's scary, is right now, he's not in treatment. They think because of the cancer's location and the type, that surgery is the better option. So it's really just the cancer that is doing this to him.  EOS 4 1 36 [Providing Suggestions] Definitely hard. You'll have to try to find something for you to relax. Even if it's just walking or reading. 
[reference_response]	definitely hard. you'll have to try to find something for you to relax. even if it's just walking or reading.
[hypothesis_response]	you're a good person. i hope that you and your dog are doing well. i know that there are many people who have had their dogs passed away, and it'll be hard to see them live forever.

How long were you together for?  EOS 4 0 3 7 years  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Wow that is a really long time. I can understand why you are feeling so lousy. Is there any chance of reconciliation?  EOS 4 0 5 probably not. or at least i dont see that happening in the near future  EOS 4 0 6 they cheated on me  EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I remember when my partner left me after eight years I felt that I was never going to get over it. I was angry and miserable for a very long time.  EOS 4 0 8 thats what im expecting to be. oh well, at least with the year we have all had i can just add this to the pile.  EOS 4 1 9 [Others] Yes it has been a really terrible year for all of us. I am so sorry that this happened to you on top of everything else!  EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how bad it feels but I can promise you that it will fade after time.  EOS 4 0 11 thanks, its been tough. i still have my dog at least.

EOS 4 0 15 i actually dont know. she's a rescue from mexico. she's a mix breed. maybe some whipit and lab. she looks like dobby from harry potter lol  EOS 4 1 16 [Others] Rescues are the best. My two are rescues and it took them a while to trust me but now they love me unconditionally. It is good that you have a pet in your life .. much better than your useless ex I think!  EOS 4 0 17 haha yep. i think my dog is thrilled with having the extra bed space, as mean as that sounds  EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] LOL well it's good that you are able to look on the bright side about this.

EOS 2 0 5 Recently identified in london  EOS 2 1 6 [Information] Hopefully soon cases will be lowered due to the vaccine. How are you feeling about COVID?  EOS 2 0 7 Is that vaccine will help to control the new variant of corona  EOS 2 1 8 [Others] I think so. I have my fingers crossed.  EOS 2 1 9 [Question] How are you feeling during this pandemic?

I have been feeling quite lonely too, I find myself feeling lonely at work and struggling to find someone I trust to talk to about these emotions. Do you have a friend or family member that you trust who might understand some of these feelings?  EOS 3 0 5 i do have a few friends that i think i can talk to about how i am feeling however the thought of them being too busy with their work is what prevents me from reaching out to them.  EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand. Correct me if i'm wrong, it sounds like you're nervous to open up to these trusted people because you think they might be distracted by their work to provide the empathy you need and fully understand how you are feeling. Does that sound right?  EOS 3 0 7 you know i think that you are right about this. it has always been difficult for me to open to others even with those that have been there for me when i needed someone. i feel like a mix of emotions nervous but at the same time wanting to reaching out for help  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I understand these feelings very well. Sometimes, my fear overshadows my want for help. I find it easier to open up to others through writing rather than face to face. Have you considered putting your feelings in writing and opening up to trusted friends and family in this way?  EOS 3 0 9 i have been writing for a while but due to my emotions i have stopped writing like i used to. when i did write i did notice a change in my feelings it became more positive and less depressed. now that i stopped writing its like i went back into depression  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It sounds like writing your feelings down helped you greatly in the past. May I suggest going back to writing and even letting someone you trust read what you have written down to understand how you are feeling?

EOS 2 0 3 Well 2020 is bothering me, like everyone else.. earlier this year my job was terminated, then for 3 months I was not bringing in income. Now that COVID is still out there, I fear that my current job will be terminated  EOS 2 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. 2020 has been tough for many, so you are not alone.  EOS 2 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been through a similar situation in the beginning of the year where I have lost my job. I was fearful but I kept thinking positive thoughts and it helped me get through tough times.  EOS 2 0 6 True, I have been trying to think of other things I can do, like start a business  EOS 2 0 7 But I have been working for 20 years, that I feel like I am supposed to work for someone else and not for myself.  EOS 2 1 8 [Information] That is a great idea. The government has great support programs for new business owners like you.  EOS 2 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think working for yourself is great. You can set your own hours, chart your own path. It would help with your employment situation for sure.  EOS 2 0 10 I feel that I have not ideas. I feel like i have been thinking about a business idea for myself and family for some time now. I wonder how others decide on what to do  EOS 2 0 11 Like how to get that motivation in their head to start something really new  EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] My suggestion would be to think what your local neighborhood needs - maybe it is lacking a cafe or a grocery store?  EOS 2 0 13 I know, i really want a niche company.. Something that no one has thought of, or is not yet in my community.  EOS 2 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, I can identify with that. Motivation is hard - but think about your future job situation and your family.  EOS 2 0 15 I would love to do a zero waste company or store, since that is what I am really into.  EOS 2 0 16 Do you think it is hard to set up a business plan?  EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's a great idea! Green is the new way to go! I believe in you.  EOS 2 0 18 Oh Thank You!

EOS 0 0 4 My company just laid off 10% of the workforce and furloughed another 10%. I'm worried I'm going to be in the next round.  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Why do you think you are the next round?

[contxt]	2 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just to clarify, you are extremely anxious about the pandemic and the affect it may have on you because of your weakened immune system.  EOS 2 0 7 Well kind of yes. I am going crazy because I've had this for 8 years now and it's forever changing. I've been hospitalized so many times its crazy. This pandemic has made things worse because stress makes it all worse  EOS 2 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Just from the few messages we have exchanged, I can tell it makes you very anxious  EOS 2 0 9 Its just really depressing not knowing what to expect next. Its hard to trust the good days sometimes because you can have a wonderful day and wake up really sick the next. Its very unpredictable and I think whats worse is that people really don't understand.  EOS 2 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Have you reached out to support groups for people with auto-immune issues? it is often helpful to speak with people who are experiencing the same issues you are.  EOS 2 0 11 Yes I am part of many on facebook, and yes it does help a lot. I just wish my husband would be able to understand. He says and does some things that make me feel even worse. Almost like he thinks I'm making it up at times. Like, dear goodness no.  EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Have you talked to him about the way he reacts to your immune issues? Sometimes people don't realize they are not being helpful and they think they are doing good when they aren't.  EOS 2 0 13 I have tried to talk to him but he seems very uninterested at times. I even tried going to counseling with him and that didn't work. It's just frustrating. He was with me when the one doctor had said just how bad it was and he didn't seem to really pay attention. He was also there when I had to have an emergancy blood transfusion and it was really hard to read him. He just doesnt say or so much  EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Have you asked what his feelings are towards it? Maybe he is afraid and worried about your health and he isn't sure how to express it and sometimes it comes off as uninterested.  EOS 2 0 15 Yeah whenever I try it's like pulling teeth. I know some of it is how he was brought up. I don't think his dad ever showed much emotion/  EOS 2 0 16 so yes I'm sure that has something to do with it. I also feel bad a lot of the time because I have two kids. I feel like I fail them a lot  EOS 2 0 17 our oldest was born before I got sick. Our youngest was a miracle baby. I was on birth control and he was determained anyway :) He is definatly a gift but I feel bad often  EOS 2 1 18 [Question] Have you been able to talk to your kids about this as well?  EOS 2 0 19 My oldest yes, he seems to understand, he is 8.5 years old. Our youngest is only one so he doesn't understand any of this yet.  EOS 2 0 20 He says he understands, but I'm not sure on just what level.  EOS 2 1 21 [Others] Yea, with young kids it is hard to tell sometimes 
[reference_response]	yea, with young kids it is hard to tell sometimes
[hypothesis_response]	is he on medication? that could help. i think there are free online resources that could be used to help you with this.

[contxt]	4 1 3 [Question] OK, thanks for explaining. Can I ask what makes you think she has moved on with her life? how recently did you guys split up?  EOS 4 0 4 About three months ago. I have started to miss her badly. I saw her with another guy when I was out at the supermarket at the weekend. She lives near me so I wasn't surprised but I don't know who this guy is.  EOS 4 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So to clarify, you ended things and think this wasn't the right thing to do. You have seen her with someone else and now you think you want her back.  EOS 4 0 6 Yeah that's right. I can't believe she has moved on so quickly.  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Can I ask, for how long have you thought you have made a mistake by ending things. was it when you saw her with someone else?  EOS 4 0 8 I must admit it was only when I saw her with someone else that I started to really miss her. do you think I'm just feeling jealous because we were so close and now I've seen her with someone else?  EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I had a friend who was in a very similar situation to this. he was in a long term relationship with a girl for 5-years. they split up and stayed friends. It was only when he saw her with someone else that he decided he wanted to give things another go.  EOS 4 0 10 I think you might be right actually. I didn't really miss her until I saw her with someone else. is this normal I don't know what to do about this?  EOS 4 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] I'd say this is completely normal. I can tell by talking to you that you did have strong feelings for this person once and seeing her with someone else has made you remember the good times.  EOS 4 0 12 Well that's good to know. I'm not normally the jealous type but I suppose we did have good times and I want her to be happy I suppose. I do think I've made a mistake though now I've thought about it!  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can tell you are a caring person and really do care about your ex-girlfriend happiness. I'm sure you will do the right thing but you need to think of yourself.  EOS 4 0 14 do you think I should try and get in touch with her and tell her how I feel?  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I think you need to think carefully about what you really want. If you feel like this then I would suggest you do talk to her about it, however you may be best talking it through with a friend or family member first  EOS 4 0 16 That's not a bad idea. I think I will speak to one of my friends about this ,he's normally pretty good with that kind of thing.  EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] yes it's really good to talk it through with someone first just really understand if trying to restart your old relationship is the right thing to do for you.  EOS 4 0 18 I think I conversation has actually helped me understand my motivations a little better. you have also given me some good suggestions so thank you for that  EOS 4 1 19 [Others] I'm happy to hear that.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hello there, i am having a hard time because my boyfriend and I just broke up  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I'm so sorry to hear that. Was there any reasons that lead to the decision?  EOS 3 0 3 I think I was feeling overwhelmed by his political views and with the election and everything it became much more obvious that we weren't right for each other. But Im nervous with the holidays coming up that I will be sad to be alone  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel you, it's scary to not be with the person you love so suddenly, especially during holiday  EOS 3 0 5 It is!! we were together for 5 years, so this is uncharted territory for me  EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] However, from what you told me, it's no longer fit for you two to be together as your views are opposite. Maybe this is for the better  EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] You can plan to spend the holiday with your friends or family instead. We are usually busy and neglect the most important people. This is the time to take care of that  EOS 3 0 8 That is true, and that was why I broke it off. He supported Trump, which I knew 4 years ago during the election, but this year it was overwhelming.  EOS 3 0 9 I will be with family thankfully, we have a small family so COVID isn't something I have to worry about.  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. You made the right decision, if not now you will get in even more arguments in the future. He is just not the right person  EOS 3 0 11 Overall, I know im going to be ok, but it feels so fresh and like it hurts still.  EOS 3 1 12 [Others] Spend the time now that you have on yourself too. Be an even better version of you  EOS 3 0 13 Thank you for vaildating my decision.  EOS 3 0 14 Yes, that is my plan. Focus on me and finding out what it is that I truly want in life.  EOS 3 0 15 He's helped me understand what I don't want.  EOS 3 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] That's the right attitude. With the right person, you learn what you like. With the wrong person, you learn what to avoid  EOS 3 0 17 Have you ever gone through something like this?  EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] No I have not, but I have someone ghosted on my before. It hurt and actually helps me realize who cares and serious about me  EOS 3 0 19 That can be just as hurtful! I heard something helpful once that if someone is into you youll know it and if you dont know it, then you dont want to be with them anyways.  EOS 3 0 20 Or that you shouldn't be with them  EOS 3 1 21 [Others] Yeah, it took me quite a long time to break it off, and I'm glad I did. I'm glad you decided to call it off with your ex too, it's not an easy decision  EOS 3 0 22 Thank you for all your help!  EOS 3 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] you too, it's very nice talking to you

EOS 4 0 10 I tried it. But I couldn't concentrate on it.  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] you could try going for a walk or mediating, they are great ways to clear your head.  EOS 4 0 12 Yes.

You feel as though you don't have any friend's currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It's so hard to see people and keep relationships right now  EOS 3 0 5 Well it's more that I think I've never had friends. Not anyone I can confide in or laugh with  EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's a really hard thing to be going through. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any really close family members that you are able to confide in?  EOS 3 0 7 I don't think I'd want to let them know how unhappy I am to be honest  EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn't have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it's 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do. I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that. Have you heard about those or looked into them?  EOS 3 0 9 I've never heard of friendship apps to be honest  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Yeah! They are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with.  EOS 3 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] But it sounds to me that you are pretty overall sad right now. You don't want family to know about how sad you are. Do you think it's more than just feeling like you don't have any friends?  EOS 3 0 12 I'd really like someone local though, someone who I could meet up with face to face and who knew my town  EOS 3 1 13 [Information] On most of the apps, it connects you with people in your town!  EOS 3 1 14 [Information] people close by  EOS 3 0 15 I don't know if it's more than that. What do you mean?  EOS 3 0 16 The problem is that I lack the courage to go out and meet people.  EOS 3 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Well personally, I have struggled with putting myself down a lot and blaming myself for things that I shouldn't blame myself for. You shouldn't blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people, or blame yourself for not having any friends! And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you! You can create those bonds and connections with people close by to you on there first, and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up  EOS 3 1 18 [Information] That way it's less awkward to hangout with someone you don't really know  EOS 3 0 19 oh you mean chat online first, before actually meeting in person?  EOS 3 1 20 [Information] Yeah, that is what is great about those friendship apps. You can get comfortable with them before you hangout :) 
[reference_response]	yeah, that is what is great about those friendship apps. you can get comfortable with them before you hangout : )
[hypothesis_response]	yes! that'll give you an opportunity to talk to people you don ; t know about, and not have to deal with people you know for months. i think that'd be a great first step.

EOS 1 0 5 I haven't really tried to bring it up, but maybe I should.  EOS 1 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes friends don't realize that they aren't fulfilling their end of the relationship and just need to become more aware.  EOS 1 0 7 That makes sense.

EOS 1 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I've had friends in the past who didn't call and I found out later that they were having personal struggles and it wasn't anything against me.

Have you looked on the internet such as indeed?  EOS 6 0 15 I've tried LinkedIn they have many companies hiring  EOS 6 0 16 maybe my CV is just bad  EOS 6 1 17 [Others] yes they do i am familiar with that  EOS 6 1 18 [Others] how is your resume looking?  EOS 6 0 19 I think I could improve it  EOS 6 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Have you talked to someone in your family and see if they could help you with your resume to improve it  EOS 6 0 21 I've asked some friends, I think a friend will help me out when he's not busy  EOS 6 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient  EOS 6 0 23 Yes I know  EOS 6 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] have you tried to go to place and talk to a hiring boss about a job?

[contxt]	0 0 0 The virus is making it hard on me and causing me loneliness even more this season  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] I'm so sorry that you are feelingly lonely. If I may ask you a question, when did this start?  EOS 0 0 2 It has been for awhile.  EOS 0 0 3 about 3 months ago  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Were you feeling lonely before the virus came this year?  EOS 0 0 5 Not really. I had people to talk with  EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds that you are feeling lonely because you cannot talk to people face to face. Do I have that right?  EOS 0 0 7 I WFH. I am a writer  EOS 0 0 8 Basically because I can not at least have the nise of the people around me at times  EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I WFH as well. It can be very liberating, but oftentimes I feel lonely too.  EOS 0 1 10 [Others] Do you have more than one job that you do at home?  EOS 0 0 11 The only connection we have is like this  EOS 0 0 12 I try to write for a company. Personal views  EOS 0 0 13 My current living arrangements does not help either.

We need to push through these next few months and then it will be over.  EOS 0 0 15 Do you feel that way?  EOS 0 0 16 Are you taking the vaccine  EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I do feel that way. And yes I will take the vaccine.  EOS 0 0 18 I won't take the shot  EOS 0 0 19 I don't trust teh vaccine as it has side affects  EOS 0 1 20 [Information] Apparently, the side effects are usually minimal and temporary if you have them at all. The people that are having severe reactions have had issues with vaccines previously. I would keep an open mind. It might help to ease your anxiety about the future.

[contxt]	4 0 0 hi  EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello! How are you doing today?  EOS 4 0 2 im good. getting tired. had a long day  EOS 4 0 3 hola?  EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you worked really hard today. How are you taking care of yourself?  EOS 4 0 5 im good. just talked to my friend who is going in for heart surgery next week  EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard. I'm glad that you were able to make time for your friend who is going through a difficult time.  EOS 4 0 7 thank ya. yeah it's important im there for him right now. he has to be nervous. they're going to open 4 or 5 valves.  EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are handling the situation well, given the stressful circumstance. What are some things you are doing to cope with this difficult situation?  EOS 4 0 9 thank ya. nothing that much different. i told my sister about it. she seems understanding about it.  EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It's wonderful that you have a support network that you trust and that you can talk with about this. I know that talking through things is really helpful for me too. Have you considered seeking professional help during this time?  EOS 4 0 11 nope. i feel that i get enough support from family. it might've been an option if I didn't have a strong support system  EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's fantastic. Having family around during a tough season like this must be such a blessing. It's great that you can be there for your friend, almost as if they were part of your family, too.  EOS 4 0 13 yeah they feel like part of the family. i've known them since i was in college 20 years ago. we haven't always talked the whole time but....  EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] 20 years is a long time! It takes a lot of commitment to your friendship to not only keep in touch for that long, but also make the time to support them emotionally when it matters most. You are a loyal friend, and your friend is lucky to have you around!  EOS 4 0 15 thank ya. him and I are there for each other. We dated briefly at first but have been friends ever since. He said I was the one who got away. But he was the one who ended it lol  EOS 4 1 16 [Question] It sounds like you and him have had quite the history, but your friendship has proven to remain strong through thick and thin (20 years!). I can't imagine how stressful it must be to be for him to be waiting for surgery, and I'm sure it means the world to him that you are by his side. How has your friendship been in the midst of everything these days?  EOS 4 0 17 It's been good. We've been talking about Covid and the election too. I know I'd be nervous to go in for heart surgery.  EOS 4 1 18 [Question] That's great to hear. Both COVID and the election have certainly been stressful. What are some ways that you have been able to support each other? 
[reference_response]	that's great to hear. both covid and the election have certainly been stressful. what are some ways that you have been able to support each other?
[hypothesis_response]	oh yes, i hear you on that. i would be worried to go to the office. i also have a friend who's a doctor who knows a lot about heart surgery and that can be stressful.

[contxt]	5 0 8 I'm 53 so going through menopuase while she is going through puberty.  EOS 5 0 9 True.  EOS 5 0 10 I just wish she would take some pride in her things and herself.  EOS 5 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Ah that's a bad combination. I hear you on the menopause thing. Do you think maybe it is making you more touchy? It is me!  EOS 5 0 12 She hasn't showered in a week and hates to brush her hair.  EOS 5 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought of offering rewards if she smartens up a bit?  EOS 5 0 14 Sure, that's probably true.  EOS 5 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that once she hits puberty she will probably change her feelings about showering etc a lot :).  EOS 5 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Teenagers tend to get very very involved in their appearance :D I used to spend an hour in the shower each day  EOS 5 0 17 Unfortunately I have spoiled her rotten so that she has most everything she could want (well, not an I-phone and nintendo switch! lol)  EOS 5 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps you could gently explain to her why it's anti social to not shower for a week?  EOS 5 0 19 I think she is getting very close to the age where she will pay attention to herself and general appearance, but she's not there yet.  EOS 5 1 20 [Others] Ah you have all the fun of her teenage years to look forward to. I would not go through that again :D  EOS 5 0 21 I have, lol.  EOS 5 0 22 She is getting much better about putting clean underwear on everyday at least.  EOS 5 1 23 [Others] Well that is definitely something!!  EOS 5 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe try to help her take pride in her appearance? Give her some make up lessons?  EOS 5 0 25 She also loves to go through my personal things. Takes my nail clippers. Tries on my blush and lipstick. Looks through my drawers.  EOS 5 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that's pretty normal for a tweenage girl :) She's probably starting to be interested in make up and things  EOS 5 0 27 I don't wear makeup, except for rare days where I put on a little blush and lipstick.  EOS 5 1 28 [Self-disclosure] I don't either to be honest but a lot of young girls are interested in it  EOS 5 0 29 She does do makeup and stuff at her friend's house.  EOS 5 1 30 [Question] Are her friends a good influence on her/  EOS 5 0 31 True. She hates to brush her own hair but could sit for for an hour while I brush her hair! lol  EOS 5 0 32 Yes, for the most part.  EOS 5 1 33 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe you could treat her to a new haircut, give her a new pride in herself?  EOS 5 0 34 With the pandemic, we have not been out too much. I gave her a much needed haircut about a month ago. Trimmed off about six inches, but it's still way past her shoulders. We will hopefully go for a professional cut soon. I need one too!  EOS 5 0 35 That is a very good idea.  EOS 5 1 36 [Others] Oh of course I had forgotten about the pandemic. It seems ages since we had normal life!  EOS 5 0 37 Agreed!  EOS 5 0 38 We went to a sit down restaurant last week for the first time in a year!  EOS 5 1 39 [Others] Well I hope I have been able to be of help and it has been nice to talk to you! 
[reference_response]	well i hope i have been able to be of help and it has been nice to talk to you!
[hypothesis_response]	it'll be a long time before you can get a haircut, but i think you should do it : )

[situation]	One of my oldest friends is extremely insecure. She's been this way for a long time, but fear and immaturity have made it worse recently. It's become super frustrating to have to constantly reassure her that I love her, and she's really my friend, cause her insecurity makes her doubt anyone could love her. I'm anxious about it.

[contxt]	4 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] That is a lot to deal with, I am so sorry.  EOS 4 0 13 i am very saddened by the breakup  EOS 4 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] I hear and feel your grief. Would you call it grief? Please let me know.  EOS 4 0 15 close to grief but she is still alive  EOS 4 0 16 i saw her last week and it was like a bomb was dropped on me  EOS 4 1 17 [Question] i understand. Grief is the emotion of sadness and loss, does that resonate with you?  EOS 4 0 18 exactly  EOS 4 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I was just going to ask you if you still see her, that must have been so difficult.  EOS 4 0 20 very difficult  EOS 4 0 21 she looks soo beautiful  EOS 4 1 22 [Self-disclosure] The hollidays were very hard for me after my break up, we were going to marry like you. Isort the season and all the expectations and memories of exacerbated the loss for me. Do you think that might be making you feel worse?  EOS 4 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered that You must be beautiful/handsome for her to be attracted to you.  EOS 4 0 24 i think our problem started when we moved in together  EOS 4 0 25 i always felt soo lucky to have her because she is always perfect  EOS 4 1 26 [Information] I just want to say that the hollidays will be over soon and that may help.  EOS 4 1 27 [Reflection of feelings] I'm sorry, it sounds like you loved her very much.  EOS 4 0 28 i loved her just too much  EOS 4 0 29 and the holiday is not helping the matter because i felt soo lonely  EOS 4 1 30 [Information] Experts say that feeling your feelings and talking about them is really good for you to help get over a long breakup. Also that it takes a year or more to process. So know that you are doing the right things.  EOS 4 0 31 really  EOS 4 1 32 [Providing Suggestions] I was really lonely after my breakup too. I had to make myself spend time with other people that cared about me like friends and family. Even though I kind of just wanted to stay sad making myself be around other people that reminded me of the good, perfect and lovable things about myself made me feel better and gave me hope. Maybe easing your lonliness would give you some relief?  EOS 4 0 33 so you are advising me to go out more and mixed up with people  EOS 4 1 34 [Others] You sound like a sensitive and loving person. Those are wonderful qualities. I noticed them and we are strangers. I'm sure you have many more.  EOS 4 0 35 you are soo kind  EOS 4 1 36 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you don't feel like going out?  EOS 4 0 37 i dont know what i think of my self really  EOS 4 0 38 i rally dont feel like going anywhere  EOS 4 1 39 [Reflection of feelings] It's normal to feel the way you do as you sort out what happened and how to go forward.  EOS 4 0 40 ok  EOS 4 0 41 i will do that  EOS 4 0 42 thanks  EOS 4 1 43 [Information] If you dont feel like being around people, what really helped me was reminding myself of the good things about myself. Sometimes I even made a list so I didn't forget. And staying distracted sometimes helped too. Experts say coming up with some goal or project really helps.  EOS 4 0 44 ok, thats a good idea  EOS 4 1 45 [Providing Suggestions] There are also so many articles and support on the internet, don't be afraid to just search "getting over a relationship" or 'bad breakup advice" there are so many people that have gone through this. Ypu are not alone.  EOS 4 1 46 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know that nothing I say can take away your pain or make it not have happened, but I care that you have these feelings and I care about you. 
[reference_response]	i know that nothing i say can take away your pain or make it not have happened, but i care that you have these feelings and i care about you.
[hypothesis_response]	there is a reason there are a lot of people saying to quit, and if you don t, it can be a bad time to start a new relationship.

[contxt]	5 0 1 hi  EOS 5 0 2 i'm nereida  EOS 5 1 3 [Question] Hi, do have any issues that you would like to share with me today?  EOS 5 0 4 i am in disputed mod with my friends  EOS 5 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that. So, you and your friends are not seeing eye to eye? Do you mind telling me what the issue is that yo are not agreeing on?  EOS 5 0 6 I explained my personal problems but they are not giving proper response  EOS 5 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That can be difficult and I can relate to that too. When friends do not respond the way that we feel that they should it can be really hard. Do you have any family that you are close with?  EOS 5 0 8 They need more money from me, but i couldn't give that much amount  EOS 5 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I understand the issue of money can cause a lot of problems in a relationship. I had a best friend borrow money once and it lead to her never paying it back and we stopped being friends. Do you plan on trying to talk to your friends soon? Maybe I can give you some advice on how to approach them.  EOS 5 0 10 I want to speak with them because they are in good nature  EOS 5 1 11 [Others] Maybe you could chose a place to meet that is neutral, somewhere at a park or at a cafe. You can ask them to reflect on the good memories in your friendship and then express how you value them as people and friends. Does that sound like something you can try?  EOS 5 0 12 Yes, i want to do some moderate friendship with them  EOS 5 1 13 [Information] That is a good idea too. Having boundaries is the healthiest part of a relationship so that neither party gets taken advantage of. Setting up lines not to cross is a great idea.  EOS 5 0 14 I want to do some help to them but i don't do expect more from them  EOS 5 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I understand that friends can disappoint us sometimes and friendships can take a lot of effort. I would recommend starting a journal. A daily journal can help you express your feelings on paper and it can help you from getting to frustrated and keeping your feelings inside.  EOS 5 0 16 Yes, some disappointments show us about real face of friends, so it was an experience to me.  EOS 5 1 17 [Information] I am proud of you today because you reached out and have tried to find help outside of yourself. You are growing and trying to do your best.  EOS 5 0 18 Sure, it is my new way of relationship to me with others  EOS 5 1 19 [Information] Yes, you're growing and trying to do your best and wanting to expand your boundaries and make them clear. You have taken the right approach and are on the best track to having a successful relationship in the future. Great Job! Thank you for sharing your story with me today. 
[reference_response]	yes, you're growing and trying to do your best and wanting to expand your boundaries and make them clear. you have taken the right approach and are on the best track to having a successful relationship in the future. great job! thank you for sharing your story with me today.

EOS 3 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i think you are going to be okay, there are definately tough times but you seem to have a grip on knowing what you need. that is great  EOS 3 0 33 Yeah, I gotta do therapy thats a must and I think it has to be in person so I can try to let some of it out with someone face to face.......but that's going to be very hard, to trust someone and open up about everything because its not just depression  EOS 3 0 34 Online is convenient but its just too much going on  EOS 3 1 35 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i agree, just with all the covid crap i know it can be hard to get a face to face! :)  EOS 3 0 36 Right...  EOS 3 1 37 [Affirmation and Reassurance] its great that you know what you need to do though adn that you know what helps  EOS 3 1 38 [Question] is there anytihng else you want to talk about?  EOS 3 0 39 Ah I don't know it's too much, I don't want to make this hours long  EOS 3 0 40 But thank you for talking a little bit about it with me and sharing those resources  EOS 3 0 41 Hopefully I can find a 'natural' way to fix these things without taking meds that might change who I am for the worst or something  EOS 3 0 42 Hope you have a nice night and stay healthy, you and your family  EOS 3 1 43 [Affirmation and Reassurance] hang in there!

[contxt]	4 0 0 I'm still sad about it.  EOS 4 0 1 Do you think I should contact him?  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Please tell me more about your story  EOS 4 0 3 I am living abroad and was really into this guy. We dated for almost a year but both wanted to do our summer vacation with friends. When he got back, he told me he was with another girl. I broke up with him. Now I miss him.  EOS 4 0 4 I want to call him or text.  EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Please don't do that. You made the right decision to break up with him as he doesn't respect you at al  EOS 4 0 6 It was just one time, but I wonder if he'd do it again.  EOS 4 0 7 But I thought I'd live in this other country forever and we'd be together. Now I may have to go home.  EOS 4 1 8 [Others] I would say this, if he does it once, he will do it again  EOS 4 0 9 How can I know that for sure?  EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe going home isn't too bad after all. You may even meet someone better there  EOS 4 1 11 [Others] From my experience, people who cheat always cheat again  EOS 4 0 12 I really like it here though, and with Covid, it's hard to think about traveling.  EOS 4 0 13 Has someone cheated on you?  EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Luckily I have never been in that situation but my friends have  EOS 4 0 15 It never happened to me before.  EOS 4 0 16 I feel betrayed.  EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But trust me, you made the right decision.

[contxt]	4 0 0 I am worried about being perfect on my job. I don't want to lose my job.  EOS 4 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you are trying to be perfect on your job because you are worried about losing your job. How long have you been at your job?  EOS 4 0 2 I have been working for about 4 months, but I just am not as fast at it as everyone else. I'm trying so hard working late and everything but it's never enough.  EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That can be hard when you are working so hard to try to do your best. Can you consult with a supervisor or co-workers to get some help?  EOS 4 0 4 Maybe I could ask my friend and co-worker for some tips. I'm a little embarrassed to do so, but don't know where to turn. I don't want to get fired.  EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Asking for help isn't always a bad thing. I asked for help at my last job and they gave me someone to help out. I was so relieved.  EOS 4 0 6 That's true maybe it could turn out for the better. But what if they see me as incompetant?  EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I can see that you have worry of being seen incompetent but as long as you are doing your best, they have to see the efforts you are making as positive.  EOS 4 0 8 That's a good way to put it.  EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes deep breaths can help keep you calm when approaching others in an anxiety provoking situation.  EOS 4 0 10 I will have to try that. That might help.  EOS 4 1 11 [Information] Have you thought of doing additional work related trainings? Sometimes they can give suggestions to improve work abilities.  EOS 4 0 12 That sounds great. Do you think my work would be supportive?  EOS 4 1 13 [Information] Work can often pay for trainings or offer suggestions what may improve work strategies.  EOS 4 0 14 Wow, I hope I can take advantage of that. I will have to check into that. Who should I approach at work?  EOS 4 1 15 [Information] You could ask your immediate supervisor or sometimes Human resources for support.  EOS 4 0 16 I can do that. I think I'll reach out tomorrow to Human Resources for some help.  EOS 4 1 17 [Question] That sounds like a good plan to reach out for support. Is there anything else I can help with?  EOS 4 0 18 No that should be all. I am feeling more confident in strategies to use to help me. Thanks  EOS 4 1 19 [Others] You are very welcome. 
[reference_response]	you are very welcome.
[hypothesis_response]	i am glad i could help. i hope you find the solution you need.

[contxt]	4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know those feelings of sadness can feel like they will never end- I have felt that way too before.  EOS 4 0 6 Do you feel like the best part of your life was over? That is how I feel now. Its seem like all of my plans for the future are over and ruined.  EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] But they do pass eventually and become easier to manage- with time and care. Do you have anyone in your life, a friend or family member who you can lean on when you're feeling so sad?  EOS 4 0 8 I have a best friend but she told me that she didn't like my boyfriend from the beginning so she is glad that we broke up. Well, that I got dumped.  EOS 4 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like it's hard to have your best friend not be as supportive as you want during this hard time. What has been helping you to pass the time these days- do you have any activities or hobbies that you like to do to relax, have fun, or take your mind of things?  EOS 4 0 10 I have been wanting to buy a bike and start taking my dog out for little bike rides. I want to get one with a basket and have her sit in the front. I just hate being alone and I feel so sad about doing everything alone now.  EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] That's a great idea. I love taking walks and bike rides outside when I feel down. I also have a little dog and she helps me whenever I'm feeling lonely- dogs are great at providing comfort and unconditional love.  EOS 4 0 12 I just bought my puppy and she is super comforting. I think that because she was a recuse dog I feel a greater attachment. It is kind of nice having her.  EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] My dog has also helped me meet other people and make friends- sometimes I'll walk my dog with others or go on bike rides with friends. If there is a dog park or local park nearby, maybe you can go and talk to other people there- talking about your dogs is a great icebreaker!  EOS 4 0 14 I know about a local dog park and think I will visit it today. That is a really good idea. I don't need a bike for that.  EOS 4 1 15 [Information] I'm glad to hear that! I hope you have a great time there! Research has also shown that spending time outside everyday is really good for our mental health.  EOS 4 0 16 You are giving me something to think about that isn't related to the break up. I feel like a weight is sort of lifting off of me. I think I needed to talk and get some of my feelings on the table today.  EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] If you are still interested in getting a bike, I'd say go for it too! Biking is a great stress relief and form of exercise that often makes me feel better.  EOS 4 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am so glad to hear that and am so happy you are talking to me is making you feel better.  EOS 4 0 19 Yes, I really want to get one but since I don't have a lot of money right now I will waitr on that and go to the dog park instead. I also heard about yoga iin the park.  EOS 4 1 20 [Information] Those are both great ideas! Yoga in the park sounds awesome. Yoga is another great stress reliever and form of exercise that is often free or very inexpensive. 
[reference_response]	those are both great ideas! yoga in the park sounds awesome. yoga is another great stress reliever and form of exercise that is often free or very inexpensive.
[hypothesis_response]	it sounds that you are very committed to getting your dog out of the house. i wish you all the best in your future.
[comet query]	Yes, I really want to get one but since I don't have a lot of money right now I will waitr on that and go to the dog park instead. I also heard about yoga iin the park.

[contxt]	5 0 1 Good evening, thanks for taking the time to talk with me.  EOS 5 1 2 [Question] No problem. How can I help you tonight?  EOS 5 0 3 I am having issues dealing with my feelings about ending my long term relationship with my children's father.  EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand, you are struggling with dealing with ending a long term relationship with your child's father.  EOS 5 0 5 Exactly right, after 15 years and 4 kids, he cheated on me and the affair produced a child.  EOS 5 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I am so sorry to hear that. My ex-fiance cheated on me and got pregnant with another man, so I know how rough this type of thing is.  EOS 5 1 7 [Question] Have you been able to talk to him about it yet?  EOS 5 0 8 At this point, I don't want to talk, I am so disgusted I want nothing more to do with him, regardless of the kids.  EOS 5 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Have you talked to the kids about it? It will be important for them to understand what is going on and why.  EOS 5 0 10 The kids are pretty smart, they found out and was mad at first, but now they are accepting, which is making me even more disgusted. I have even started to resent my kids for it.  EOS 5 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I think it would help to sit down and have a conversation with them about it. It is important that they know how you feel and that you are there for them, and that they aren't the reason for the issues.  EOS 5 0 12 I did at least sit down with the kids about it, told t hem how I felt, explained the nature of the situation. But they weren't on my side, they acted like they were on my side at first but then switched up on me, made me feel like I was the one wrong!?!  EOS 5 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about seeking a group of people who have been through this same situation that you are going through now? It often helps to talk to people who have been through the same things and get their help to get through the situation.  EOS 5 0 14 Apparently that's you smh lol.. How did you feel? What did you do?  EOS 5 1 15 [Self-disclosure] This is true I suppose. I made sure to have a conversation with her first in order to get some closure on the situation. After that I focused on more of my hobbies that I hadn't been able to do in a while in order to keep my mind distracted and off of the situation.  EOS 5 0 16 I'm still not ready to have that conversation with him. He's acting like I made him cheat on me. Maybe I should find some hobbies to distract myself until I can myself to that point.  EOS 5 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I think that would definitely help!  EOS 5 1 18 [Question] What are some things you like to do? 
[reference_response]	what are some things you like to do?
[hypothesis_response]	it's good that you're looking to help others through this.

I am not all that familiar with that, and it does sound intriguing.  EOS 2 0 5 I have not done very well in my exams and i'm worried about what my parent's reaction will be when they find out  EOS 2 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] I tend to worry at times too, and it almost always helps to talk about it with someone.  EOS 2 1 7 [Question] Do you usually get along well with your parents?  EOS 2 0 8 I agree, thank you for being open to talking to me  EOS 2 0 9 Yes, I do, but they have invested a lot in my education  EOS 2 0 10 And I feel that I have let them down  EOS 2 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds to me like you're thinking that you've disappointed your parents by falling behind in class a little?

EOS 3 0 11 yes it does and I have no support because i moved to a new state so all my family is in tn and i am in ga now, no i do not i might think about that though i was thinking of maybe doing something online, but my finance is and i are doing a long distance thing for now and I do not want to accidentally go over a line if i happen to be paired with a male to talk to so i am just here waiting for him to get home  EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] well, when it comes to support groups, you can choose your sponsors and people who you want to build your support group with, i know it can be hard living in a state away from your family, i live in California and my family lives in Texas. You could also look at married men as an acceptable solution to avoiding that line as well.  EOS 3 1 13 [Question] are you religious at all?  EOS 3 0 14 no i dont think that would go over well. No i am agnostic. I do wish i had a good friend that knew me who I could talk to. he told me i could talk to one friend in tn and i call when i need something but it bothers him so i try not to do that.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] there are always groups on social media, some are even local.  EOS 3 1 16 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so your fiance is upset when you talk to your friend back home?  EOS 3 0 17 yeah it bothers him. and i don't want to bother him.

EOS 4 0 8 January 15th is my last day  EOS 4 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] That's not a good spot to be in, I completely understand.  EOS 4 0 10 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021.  EOS 4 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why?  EOS 4 0 12 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID-19 lockdowns.  EOS 4 1 13 [Question] How long have you been working there?  EOS 4 0 14 I am very sad about this country and my work situation.  EOS 4 0 15 For 5 years. I work in accounting.  EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID-19 really has got us all down.  EOS 4 0 17 What a great nation we live in.....a future 3rd world one.  EOS 4 0 18 Yeah, but I was a good accountant.  EOS 4 1 19 [Others] WOW, I'm sure that is a big change for you...  EOS 4 0 20 Yeah, I have not told my wife about it just yet.  EOS 4 1 21 [Others] I agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them  EOS 4 1 22 [Question] Uh, oh, how do you think she will react?  EOS 4 0 23 Yeah, I am not sure. I better wait to break the news in 2021.  EOS 4 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] The good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there.  EOS 4 0 25 And I am not the only one who is losing my job. Seems that all of accounting is going to be getting the axe. It makes me sad....  EOS 4 1 26 [Information] You could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. Do you have a resume?  EOS 4 0 27 Plus, I have a 50 dollar a day spending habit on lottery tickets to one day hit it BIG  EOS 4 0 28 Yes, I have a resume that I have not updated just yet.  EOS 4 0 29 I have a college education and a CPA to boot, but I need one lucky break in life.  EOS 4 1 30 [Information] Sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath.  EOS 4 0 31 Maybe I can spend some quality time with my kids without them knowing I will be out of a job as of 01/15/2021  EOS 4 0 32 It is almost Christmas, too.  EOS 4 1 33 [Information] I hear ya, I feel like that quite a bit. Like if isn't one thing it's another. I'm sure your wife will understand how the economy has gotten and that she knows that it isn't your fault.  EOS 4 0 34 Maybe, but we have a huge mortgage and two BMW's. We spend lavishly....  EOS 4 0 35 Plus, I spend 50 dollars a day on lotto  EOS 4 1 36 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes it's hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had. Those would not be good times if it were'nt for tough times.  EOS 4 0 37 True, but the Office was my home away from home. I need to figure out how to deal with my sadness.....  EOS 4 1 38 [Providing Suggestions] Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times.  EOS 4 1 39 [Question] Do you have any hobbies?  EOS 4 0 40 Yeah, that is a good point. Should I change careers?  EOS 4 0 41 I like to walk and do pushups on a regular basis; does that count??  EOS 4 1 42 [Others] I don't think a huge change like that is neccessary, maybe just looking into options. Unemployment and government help until something else comes up.

EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] you are right about others looking for work too. Are you signed up with many job seeking apps?  EOS 2 0 9 I have not been using apps.

EOS 5 1 8 [Question] Oh no, do you want to talk about it? What hapepned?  EOS 5 0 9 She barely speaks to me - she didn't even message me on my 50th birthday - but then she texts to demand my mom's wedding ring  EOS 5 0 10 ... because she wants to give it to her 16 year old daughter. Who will also be getting a Lexus for her birthday.  EOS 5 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating. Do you speak to your brother?  EOS 5 0 12 How is a diamond solitaire an appropriate gift for a 16 year old?  EOS 5 0 13 He is so rabidly defensive of her, if I bring it up, it won't matter if he agrees with me or not - he'll take her side.  EOS 5 0 14 And both our parents died last year - I can't lose him too.  EOS 5 1 15 [Self-disclosure] That's so inappropriate, my husband's brother is the same way with his kids. They are giving such inappropraite gifts for their age.  EOS 5 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh wow, i'm so sorry about your parents. Losing parents is so hard. Definitely need to make sure you don't lose your brother as well.  EOS 5 0 17 She's the only granddaughter - she'll get the ring eventually, if she wants it (probably won't). My SIL apparently thinks that was the only valuable thing about my mom - she didn't want any of the books, or art, or photos...  EOS 5 0 18 Are you too busy to do this right now...?

EOS 2 0 3 I am afraid about changing my job during COVID but I am not happy at my current job.  EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are unhappy at your job and want to do something else? What exactly are your fears?  EOS 2 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have found writing out a pro and con list helps me -- On one side I look at the benefits, then I put the cons on the other side. They I weigh them, even if there are more cons, sometimes the PROS are much better.  EOS 2 0 6 I am a helpdesk associate for a large telecom company. I don't like the hours and the pay here but I am afraid if I can get a job outside in this time.  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand that looking for a job can be stressful and challenging at this time, but one thing is for certain, you will never know if you don't try.  EOS 2 0 8 I have tried the Pros & Cons method. Pros are better pay and hours, cons are tougher interviews and more rounds  EOS 2 0 9 Yes, I think I need to give a try but I lack the confidence to put my resume out in the market.  EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I like the "Do it afraid!" method. I can still try even if I feel nervous. You really do not need confidence to put your resume out there, you just need to do it afraid. And when I "do it afraid" I realize it was easier than I thought.  EOS 2 0 11 "Do it afraid"? Do you mean do it even if I am afraid? It sounds a bit too optimistic to me.  EOS 2 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I used to be paralyzed with self confidence, but the truth is, your confidence doesn't come from your job, your confidence comes from being a lovable person. The confidence that you are the person you want to be.  EOS 2 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds optimistic but it is the truth, when I step out to perform, I'm always nervous. BEING nervous looking for a job, that is NORMAL. To expect to feel like you are super confident is unrealistic. Most people are nervous, but they do it anyway. 
[reference_response]	it sounds optimistic but it is the truth, when i step out to perform, i'm always nervous. being nervous looking for a job, that is normal. to expect to feel like you are super confident is unrealistic. most people are nervous, but they do it anyway.

EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I'm sorry to hear, that can be really straining on someone, sounds like you're stressed about the situation  EOS 3 0 5 I guess, I mostly just feel really depressed, like I didn't do a good job.

EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's great that your willing to speak to someone about it.  EOS 3 0 9 I think it might help, maybe I won't feel so sad afterward or so useless.  EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like being fired has made you more self negative. Does that sound right?  EOS 3 0 11 Yes.

EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That can be hard when you are working so hard to try to do your best. Can you consult with a supervisor or co-workers to get some help?

[contxt]	4 0 3 You have to read the topic part of it  EOS 4 1 4 [Others] I can't see the topic area of yours  EOS 4 0 5 Ok  EOS 4 1 6 [Others] What happened? Who is jealous of what  EOS 4 0 7 So I had posted in that the following.  EOS 4 0 8 I just had a baby a couple days ago. Two weeks before I found out a really good friend deleted me on facebook  EOS 4 0 9 No reason given she's just gone  EOS 4 0 10 She deleted my husband and mom too. We have mutual friends that she did not delete  EOS 4 0 11 I'm thinking maybe she's jealous about me having a baby. I don't know why else out of the blue she would of done that.  EOS 4 0 12 The only other thing I can think of is she was dating this one horrible guy and maybe she's back with him but I feel like she would of dated other mutual friends because she knew none of us liked him  EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] She may have been jealous but also may secretly want one, and she shouldn't stay with a guy she doesn't like  EOS 4 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she thinks you are more ahead than her in life or something  EOS 4 0 15 I think she maybe wants a baby/husband/family and just hasnt found it yet. It never seemed to bother her before.  EOS 4 0 16 Some of our other mutual friends have kids so I don't understand  EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe it was one of those things she always wanted but never had the chance like you said. And maybe it just got to her at one point. It's not your fault though, with time she will ease out  EOS 4 0 18 I wanted to reach out to her but since I didn't do anything I figured if she wants to talk she can reach out to me  EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe she would be too scared since she already blocked you, you should give her time to ease up and then start a conversation and hopefully she will be good again  EOS 4 0 20 Ya I will give her some time to maybe think about things and come back around  EOS 4 0 21 It just sucks not having my friend around during this  EOS 4 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, it will but she will come back eventually  EOS 4 0 23 I hope so  EOS 4 0 24 But then a part of me is like do I want her back.  EOS 4 0 25 You know if she can just check out so easily  EOS 4 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] That is your friend so you will miss her eventually and just give her time ;)  EOS 4 0 27 Ya you are probably right.  EOS 4 0 28 I think I am just mad now that she couldnt just talk to me about her feelings  EOS 4 1 29 [Providing Suggestions] Yeah, don't take it out on her  EOS 4 0 30 I'll try not too  EOS 4 0 31 For not I have enough to keep me busy. It's just a sad situation  EOS 4 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, i agree its unfortunate but it will work out somehow  EOS 4 0 33 It is  EOS 4 1 34 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Anyway, just keep your mind of off it  EOS 4 0 35 I will  EOS 4 1 36 [Others] Okay, thats good to hear  EOS 4 0 37 Well thanks for talking to me  EOS 4 1 38 [Others] Your welcome have a good day

[contxt]	6 0 0 Hi, how are you today?  EOS 6 1 1 [Question] I am okay. What is going on with you?  EOS 6 0 2 School's going badly. I really wish I had chosen a different major.  EOS 6 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like it must be overwhelming to keep up with all of your school work.  EOS 6 0 4 I’m majoring in computer engineering. It’s really #%$& hard! Everyone else is way smarter than I am.  EOS 6 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That does sound very difficult, but I think you can do it! Just getting into a program like that shows how smart you are!  EOS 6 0 6 It's kinda late to switch. I'm at the end of my third year. My parents keep bugging me about getting a job.  EOS 6 1 7 [Self-disclosure] To be honest with you, I switched majors a lot in college. I eventually let go of what my family thought and pursued a career I would truly enjoy for myself.  EOS 6 0 8 I wish I were in your shoes! If I change majors now, I have to redo at least a year of school, maybe more. I don't think my parents want to pay for that.  EOS 6 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Personally I took three years longer than it should to get my degree and accrued some debt because of it. Although I feel it is worth it now.  EOS 6 0 10 That's good to know. Maybe I can convince my parents to let me borrow some money. I don't want to be a computer engineer.  EOS 6 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] I'm hearing its difficult for you knowing that you are on a path that you don't really want to be on.  EOS 6 0 12 That's a good way to put it.  EOS 6 0 13 I've thought a lot about my options.  EOS 6 0 14 I've thought about take a leave of absence, switching majors, going to trade school, traveling abroad...  EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] A lot of people I know benefited from talking to an advisor or counselor for some direction. Have you done that recently?  EOS 6 0 16 I talked to the school counselor. They laid out some options. It's really about money and time. If those weren't concerns, I would switch in a heartbeat.  EOS 6 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] What about meeting with the counselor with your parents, since it seems they would need to support you financially over any extra time it might take?  EOS 6 0 18 That's a good point. Maybe we could have a Zoom meeting, even for just 15 minutes. I need to get my parents to understand my feelings.  EOS 6 0 19 The counselor might help me with that.  EOS 6 1 20 [Information] It's been shown that healthy communication can help people listen and respond more considerately when things seem difficult at first.  EOS 6 0 21 I hadn't thought of it that way. I'm so worried about schoolwork that I hadn't stepped back from the whole situation of school itself.  EOS 6 1 22 [Others] I definitely can understand that, but it is important to think about your future happiness and security too! 
[reference_response]	i definitely can understand that, but it is important to think about your future happiness and security too!
[hypothesis_response]	yes, it seems like you are very mature about this and are willing to take some steps to make sure you have a plan in place. i think it'll be a great idea to have a talk with your friends and family and see what they think about it. i would suggest you also talk to a counselor about it as well.

[contxt]	4 0 1 I'm okay I guess  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] You seem a little down. Is there anything you'd like to talk about?  EOS 4 0 3 I just don't feel like I'm good enough lately  EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are experiencing feelings of inadequacy? That is very sad. Can you tell me why you think you feel this way? Has anything changed lately?  EOS 4 0 5 Yes I feel very inadequate. Recently my best friend and I can't get along. She's always upset at me about things I'm doing  EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry to hear that. I've experienced difficulties with friendships too. Do you think you can talk with her?  EOS 4 0 7 I've tried taking to her, usually she gets very angry with me and starts yelling. She never listens to what I have to say.  EOS 4 1 8 [Others] It sounds a little as though her behaviour is toxic. Does the friendship really mean that much to you?  EOS 4 0 9 She means so much to me and she's my only friend.  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] So you feel that the friendship is worth fighting for, but she is not being responsive?  EOS 4 0 11 More than that, she's not being supportive of my decisions and that's all I want  EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Was there one specific thing that triggered this or had it been coming for a long time?  EOS 4 0 13 She hates my boyfriend, she wants me to leave him. If i don't she doesn't want to hang around me as much. She said I have to choose him or her.  EOS 4 1 14 [Information] Would you consider having some counselling together? Perhaps talk through what is going on?  EOS 4 1 15 [Others] She has no right to issue you with an ultimatum like that.  EOS 4 0 16 She moved all of her things out of our dorm room we share just because I'm still with my boyfriend. I woukd do counselling but I'm not sure she would  EOS 4 1 17 [Others] I really feel as though you are the one putting all the effort in here and she is just making selfish demands on you.  EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps it is time to try and make some new friends? Join a society or something?  EOS 4 0 19 I've realized I want to spend the rest of my life with my boyfriend and I don't think she'll like that.  EOS 4 1 20 [Others] I think you know deep down what is the best thing to do. You don't need selfish people in your life.  EOS 4 0 21 I'm a little reluctant, I'm very shy and struggle with making new friends, that's why she is do important to me.  EOS 4 1 22 [Others] You have your boyfriend though :). He will always be there for you - and not treat you as badly as she has!  EOS 4 0 23 Yes that's true. What do I say to her?  EOS 4 1 24 [Others] I don't think you owe her an explanation after how she has behaved. Leave her to make the next move  EOS 4 1 25 [Others] I hope I have been able to help you a little!  EOS 4 0 26 The problem is we technically share a room. She does come in occasionally.  EOS 4 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know that you must feel that this could be a problem but I think you will be able to just ignore her. I am afraid I must leave for my next appointment now.

She is deaf she cannot hear.  EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Hmm do you mean literally or metaphorically?  EOS 4 0 7 Literally. She cannot hear. She was born deaf.  EOS 4 1 8 [Question] Well can you communicate with her through sign language?  EOS 4 0 9 I can, But I have no hands.  EOS 4 1 10 [Others] Gosh, life hasn't treated the pair of you very well, has it?

[contxt]	0 0 25 I really don't have anyone to physically hangout with  EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok. Do you enjoy chatting with people online? You seem to chat well with me, so I think that you could connect with others virtually.  EOS 0 0 27 it's always been a struggle to make new friends to hang out with  EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Hobbies are a good way to connect with people. What do you like to do?  EOS 0 0 29 after high school it has been a struggle to meet new people to hang out  EOS 0 0 30 I tend to just hang out with new people I meet probably once and never see them again  EOS 0 1 31 [Providing Suggestions] Ok. My suggestions is that you find a friend or two to connect with virtually or physically. Perhaps joining a club, a gym or a class would help. This is one way for you to gain control of the situation.  EOS 0 0 32 I used to enjoy Zumba since I like dancing , I spend most my freetime watching movies and different series on Netflix also like to watch the home remodeling shows  EOS 0 1 33 [Information] Passive entertainment is not bad, but it does not help you make friends. Zumba and other activities are great for health and can help you meet people. Is there a place in your neighborhood?  EOS 0 0 34 I feel like I have social anxiety and that prevents me from having a conversation with someone  EOS 0 0 35 I think there is a gym nearby  EOS 0 1 36 [Providing Suggestions] You might want to see a medical doctor about that. There are probably treatments that would help you adjust to social settings.  EOS 0 0 37 I don't have insurance  EOS 0 0 38 I think psychological therapy can be expensive I don't know how much it will cost  EOS 0 1 39 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes there are free clinics, and perhaps a university has programs so that their students can learn to help patients.  EOS 0 0 40 those free clinics usually have a long wait  EOS 0 0 41 I don't know if they have improved their system  EOS 0 1 42 [Others] True, but it is important to take steps toward changing your situation.  EOS 0 0 43 I get im patient sometimes  EOS 0 0 44 yes I agree  EOS 0 1 45 [Others] I hope that this chat has helped you.  EOS 0 0 46 I think it has to do with my father being mostly a single parent raising my brother and me he used to keep us inside the home  EOS 0 0 47 most of the time  EOS 0 1 48 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. Life is about change. The past can loom large and we need to understand how it affects our perspective on life.  EOS 0 0 49 my father and brother are even worse than me now  EOS 0 0 50 they don't really have any relationships with anyone just family and they barely talk to them  EOS 0 1 51 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok. You are not them. You are a different person. You can make your own choices.  EOS 0 0 52 I don't want to be like them  EOS 0 0 53 that's why I moved out from my dad's home  EOS 0 1 54 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a good first step. Good for you!  EOS 0 0 55 its been almost 7 years since I moved out  EOS 0 1 56 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Now it is time for more steps.

EOS 4 0 3 yes it is a horrible time. I dont know what to do and i dont have a lot of support and my rent is due for over 2 months  EOS 4 1 4 [Information] There are organisations out there who can help due to the exceptional circumstances .. do you have anyone helping you?  EOS 4 0 5 i dont have anyone helping me and i am new to this city so i dont know who to turn to  EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Hmm, could you google for local organisations such as Citizen's Advice? I have found them very useful personally.  EOS 4 0 7 i have neve rheard of them but i will google them up  EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] They provided me with loads of helpful advice and other people to get in touch with. Also, have you considered using a food bank?  EOS 4 0 9 i did look up food bank, but there is none located where i live but i might be able to drive to the nearest one outside the city  EOS 4 1 10 [Information] There are religious organisations that can sometimes help too and would not expect you to be of their religion.  EOS 4 0 11 that sounds super helpful. I can check them out as well. I also dont know if iam applying to the right jobs. It makes me so sad to be rejected every week  EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to worry about it - it is not just you. The job market is awful right now but it will pick up again!  EOS 4 0 13 what else can you recommend  EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Are you eligible for unemployment benefits?  EOS 4 0 15 no because I didnt lose my job coz of covid.

EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I realise the prospect of legal action can be daunting and potentially expensive but you should be able to get legal aid and it sounds as though you really have been badly treated here.

Can you give me more information?  EOS 3 0 3 Basic story, got back to the United States from deployment.  EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, so you were overseas and were conducting the relationship long distance?  EOS 3 0 5 She kept me going while I was gone, but since I returned, she's been so cold to me  EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Do you feel that is unfair of her to have done this whilst you were away serving your country?  EOS 3 0 7 Kind of, I know that life moves on while people are away  EOS 3 0 8 I just don't get it though, I return and this is what I get  EOS 3 1 9 [Others] But she should have understood that you were doing your duty whilst also providing for the pair of you  EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Do you think it is possible that she has been unfaithful, or is it something else?  EOS 3 0 11 Possibly, but we weren't official boyfriend/girlfriend  EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Ah I see. How committed did you feel to her?  EOS 3 0 13 Maybe it was my indecision to ask her about our relationship  EOS 3 0 14 Now that I think about it, it seemed more of 80% me, 20% her  EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I know, as a woman myself. that it is quite difficult when you are seeing someone but have no idea what their intentions are.  EOS 3 0 16 Sure, I guess sex and cuddling is nice, but what I really want is someone to shopping with and eventually build a future  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered getting some sort of counselling, either just you or as a couple?  EOS 3 0 18 It has peaked my interest, but at the same time, I wonder how much of this is just me buried in the idea of a relationship, even though it's pretty one-sided now  EOS 3 0 19 Should I seek counseling for a relationship that technically wasn't official?  EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am hearing you say that you still have feelings for her but you are not sure whether to totally break away or not, given that she has  EOS 3 0 21 Yes. I hate how I love her, but I'm not getting the same energy back  EOS 3 1 22 [Others] I can't tell you what to do but I think it might be best to go with your gut instinct.  EOS 3 0 23 It will hurt, but it's definitely better just to move on, right?  EOS 3 0 24 My gut tells me that I'm not going to take 2nd place in her heart  EOS 3 1 25 [Others] It has to be your decision but I think you will know if you've made the right one.  EOS 3 0 26 I really appreciate it.  EOS 3 1 27 [Others] I hope that I have been able to give you some good advice and that you feel a little clearer about things now.

I'm ready to listen :)  EOS 0 0 3 I have been tired a lot lately, even when I sleep for 8 hours. I am not sure what to really do to help myself gain more energy and recover my sleeping schedule to normal.  EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I see. Are you finding it hard to function on not enough sleep? I have experienced that at times as well, and found it quite frustrating!  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] How much sleep are you getting now? Do you keep irregular sleep hours, e.g. the time you go to bed and get up?  EOS 0 0 6 Yes, I had a bad sleeping schedule, when I would go to sleep around 2-3am. I now get around 8 hours of sleep but I feel like it isn't enough still.  EOS 0 0 7 Would this relate to a health problem of not being active or maybe stress?  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I used to be a night owl, going to bed early in the morning. I reset my schedule very gradually. I went to bed 15 minutes earlier, and set an alarm for 8 hours later. I did that for 3 days, then I would ratchet it back another 15 minutes. It was a gradual process and the only way I could fix it.  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] Are you getting any exercise during the daytime?  EOS 0 0 10 I see, I should set more alarms for myself. I have not put the time to exorcise as I would like to. I was planning on ordering a pair of weighted jump ropes for myself.  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] Even a walk may help you sleep...I know it does for me, Jump ropes are a great idea! I was advised it's better to exercise earlier in the day, not too close to bedtime or it can affect sleep.  EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you have trouble getting to sleep or waking up in the night? Or is it more a case of just not feeling rested after your sleep?  EOS 0 0 13 I mostly work and go to school during the day so there really isn't too much time unless I decide to exorcise early in the morning. By the end of the day, I already feel exhausted from work and most of my motivation to exorcise is gone.  EOS 0 0 14 I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night.  EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see. Sleep problems are very common you certainly aren't alone in this. With some changes I am confidant you can improve your sleep. 
[reference_response]	i see. sleep problems are very common you certainly aren't alone in this. with some changes i am confidant you can improve your sleep.
[hypothesis_response]	i understand that. i also go to work during the evening, and i feel exhausted during the night as well. i usually go to class and then go to the gym before the day ends, and have to reschedule to get more rest.

[situation]	It started during my childhood, when I was 9 years old, living my father. He had a bad temper and was impatient with me, especially with school. He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes. After the age of 10, I ended up living with my mother but I would spend most of my time with my friends because I enjoyed their company more than anything. I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well. Today, I still try my best to tolerate going to college and do my best in classes even when my anxiety comes back.

[contxt]	4 1 26 [Information] I just want to say that the hollidays will be over soon and that may help.  EOS 4 1 27 [Reflection of feelings] I'm sorry, it sounds like you loved her very much.  EOS 4 0 28 i loved her just too much  EOS 4 0 29 and the holiday is not helping the matter because i felt soo lonely  EOS 4 1 30 [Information] Experts say that feeling your feelings and talking about them is really good for you to help get over a long breakup. Also that it takes a year or more to process. So know that you are doing the right things.  EOS 4 0 31 really  EOS 4 1 32 [Providing Suggestions] I was really lonely after my breakup too. I had to make myself spend time with other people that cared about me like friends and family. Even though I kind of just wanted to stay sad making myself be around other people that reminded me of the good, perfect and lovable things about myself made me feel better and gave me hope. Maybe easing your lonliness would give you some relief?  EOS 4 0 33 so you are advising me to go out more and mixed up with people  EOS 4 1 34 [Others] You sound like a sensitive and loving person. Those are wonderful qualities. I noticed them and we are strangers. I'm sure you have many more.  EOS 4 0 35 you are soo kind  EOS 4 1 36 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you don't feel like going out?  EOS 4 0 37 i dont know what i think of my self really  EOS 4 0 38 i rally dont feel like going anywhere  EOS 4 1 39 [Reflection of feelings] It's normal to feel the way you do as you sort out what happened and how to go forward.  EOS 4 0 40 ok  EOS 4 0 41 i will do that  EOS 4 0 42 thanks  EOS 4 1 43 [Information] If you dont feel like being around people, what really helped me was reminding myself of the good things about myself. Sometimes I even made a list so I didn't forget. And staying distracted sometimes helped too. Experts say coming up with some goal or project really helps.  EOS 4 0 44 ok, thats a good idea  EOS 4 1 45 [Providing Suggestions] There are also so many articles and support on the internet, don't be afraid to just search "getting over a relationship" or 'bad breakup advice" there are so many people that have gone through this. Ypu are not alone.  EOS 4 1 46 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know that nothing I say can take away your pain or make it not have happened, but I care that you have these feelings and I care about you.  EOS 4 0 47 thanks, i will check them out  EOS 4 0 48 thanks for the show of love  EOS 4 1 49 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are welcome. i hope you feel supported and encouraged. I know this will get better for you. take care of and love yourself, friend. you are worth it.  EOS 4 0 50 i will do that. thanks  EOS 4 1 51 [Providing Suggestions] and one last thing that worked for me was when I was really fixated on how perfect my ex was, i'd make a list of why they weren't and why we weren't good together. It made me think in a more balanced way.  EOS 4 0 52 really, and it worked?  EOS 4 0 53 i will try that  EOS 4 1 54 [Others] yeah, it did work. even when all could see was how great my ex was i could at least see why we didn't work and i wanted us both to be happy so writing that stuff helped me keep it in perspective. Its been a privilege listening to you . i'm wishing you all good things.  EOS 4 0 55 oh, thanks  EOS 4 0 56 thanks for the advice  EOS 4 0 57 i will work on it  EOS 4 0 58 bye  EOS 4 1 59 [Others] you're welcome. don't be afraid to reach out to others in this time, you are valuable. i hope you have a good rest of the week.

[contxt]	4 0 1 terrible, i got dumped. the other day. im alone during a pandemic.  EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your partner has left you? I am very sorry to hear that. How long were you together for?  EOS 4 0 3 7 years  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Wow that is a really long time. I can understand why you are feeling so lousy. Is there any chance of reconciliation?  EOS 4 0 5 probably not. or at least i dont see that happening in the near future  EOS 4 0 6 they cheated on me  EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I remember when my partner left me after eight years I felt that I was never going to get over it. I was angry and miserable for a very long time.  EOS 4 0 8 thats what im expecting to be. oh well, at least with the year we have all had i can just add this to the pile.  EOS 4 1 9 [Others] Yes it has been a really terrible year for all of us. I am so sorry that this happened to you on top of everything else!  EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how bad it feels but I can promise you that it will fade after time.  EOS 4 0 11 thanks, its been tough. i still have my dog at least.  EOS 4 1 12 [Others] Ah dogs are absolutely wonderful companions aren't they? Especially when the world is so isolated right now  EOS 4 0 13 she is super cuddly. this would be extremely hard without her.  EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] What breed of dog is she? I have two cats and they have been really helping me when I've been feeling low.  EOS 4 0 15 i actually dont know. she's a rescue from mexico. she's a mix breed. maybe some whipit and lab. she looks like dobby from harry potter lol  EOS 4 1 16 [Others] Rescues are the best. My two are rescues and it took them a while to trust me but now they love me unconditionally. It is good that you have a pet in your life .. much better than your useless ex I think!  EOS 4 0 17 haha yep. i think my dog is thrilled with having the extra bed space, as mean as that sounds  EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] LOL well it's good that you are able to look on the bright side about this. Have you considered making plans for the future, once the pandemic is over?  EOS 4 0 19 Yep, ill be getting back to my life and plans after. i have a bad heart condition so ive had to stay inside pretty much all year. also another messed up thing my ex did to me, cheated on me and then came back into the house. she could have passed it to me.  EOS 4 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear about your heart condition, that obvious compounds your problems. I believe that things are going to improve in the New Year though  EOS 4 1 21 [Others] Let's face it, there does come a time when it seems that not much can get worse 
[reference_response]	let's face it, there does come a time when it seems that not much can get worse
[hypothesis_response]	i am glad you are getting some relief from the pandesia, that seems like it would be a really hard time to deal with.
[comet query]	Yep, ill be getting back to my life and plans after. i have a bad heart condition so ive had to stay inside pretty much all year. also another messed up thing my ex did to me, cheated on me and then came back into the house. she could have passed it to me.

EOS 4 0 2 could be better  EOS 4 0 3 how are u  EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I'm sorry you're not feeling great, what's wrong?  EOS 4 0 5 i cant afford a house  EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] I'm sorry to hear that, we're in hard times right now for sure.  EOS 4 0 7 Ya I am barely making it through Christmas and see my sister with a house  EOS 4 0 8 I wish I had one  EOS 4 1 9 [Others] Are you in an apartment or rental situation of some sort?  EOS 4 0 10 3 bedroom apartment with 6 people  EOS 4 1 11 [Information] Have you looked into a loan for a house? Sometimes the payment on a house is close to rent payments.  EOS 4 0 12 Ya we are looking into it  EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] I know sometimes people get a loan and then have a roommate move in and charge rent to help with the finances as well.  EOS 4 0 14 Ya that does sound interesting, I could have my brother in law move in  EOS 4 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Could be something to help you out at least temporarily. I know it seems very intimidating but it'll be ok.  EOS 4 0 16 thank you that is a big help  EOS 4 1 17 [Others] You're very welcome, I hope you have a great holiday and feel better knowing you have options.

[contxt]	4 0 3 I'm just feeling sad and depressed over the breakup that I described above. Hoping for some inspiration.  EOS 4 1 4 [Others] Tell me more please I am all ears  EOS 4 0 5 I feel so betrayed. I was completely caught off guard. Now I don't know what to do with myself.  EOS 4 1 6 [Question] When did this happen, How long ago  EOS 4 0 7 Just this last week. I came home from work early Thursday. I guess I should have texted first so he could get rid of the guy. Or maybe not. Maybe it's better that I found out.  EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you had been together for awhile and all of a sudden he has another person in his life  EOS 4 0 9 We were together almost ten years. Over nine and a half. I had no idea. I don't think the guy is even someone he really cares about. I don't know.  EOS 4 1 10 [Question] Was this guy an associate of yours as well  EOS 4 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So basically this guy was a stranger that you know of.  EOS 4 0 12 Yes that's right, I'd never seen him before.  EOS 4 1 13 [Question] Did you have any children between you  EOS 4 0 14 No, it was just the two of us. And two cats. Who are still here with me. There's that at least.  EOS 4 1 15 [Question] DiId your partner work also  EOS 4 0 16 Just from home. Self-published author, some online work, stuff like that. He made about as much as I did, I wasn't the sole breadwinner or anything.  EOS 4 1 17 [Others] Maybe the time on his hands enabled to him meet someone while you were working. Did he have a following that you knew of  EOS 4 1 18 [Question] has there been habits like this before  EOS 4 0 19 Maybe it did. There are some fans of his work on social media, and he's on all the popular social media sights. I don't know if he me the guy online or what. There hasn't been anything like this before that I know of. Maybe there was. I trusted him and didn't look at his messages or anything.  EOS 4 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] His actions none the less are not right  EOS 4 1 21 [Question] Do you have an idea his websites  EOS 4 0 22 No, they weren't, I agree there. He took all his devices with him. I can see his stuff from a user point of view, like anyone else in the public could, but nothing of his personal stuff.  EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] The fact that he cheated on you and I assume you broke up with him is hard  EOS 4 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] He must have a special account that people can access to, can you possibly find it out  EOS 4 0 25 Yeah, we're over. And it is hard. I'll get past it I suppose. I don't think I could, but I don't really want to anyway at this point. It's not going to help us get back together or anything.  EOS 4 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe you need to focus on you now, and plan your days ahead.  EOS 4 0 27 I think you're right. Just look forward.  EOS 4 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Had you known before hand it might be of help, but the sudden impact does not make it any better  EOS 4 1 29 [Information] if you look back you will have regrets. If you look forward you will see a future  EOS 4 0 30 You're right. Thank you for listening. I feel a little better already. I'll get through this. Me and the cats :-)  EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions] Take a cup of coffee, sit and write your thoughts then burn them 
[reference_response]	take a cup of coffee, sit and write your thoughts then burn them
[hypothesis_response]	i hope i was able to help you through this, and that you can feel better now.

[situation]	My husband of 10 years cheated on me. After a relationship based on honesty and trust, I came home early and caught him with another man. He was more embarrassed than apologetic and quickly turned it on being all my fault. He's now moved out, and I'm feeling sad and alone.

[contxt]	3 0 2 I'm ok  EOS 3 0 3 how are you  EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I'm doing well, thanks. Why are you only doing okay, and not great?  EOS 3 0 5 I'm going through some things at the moment  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Many people are at this time. Is there anything in particular that is bothering you?  EOS 3 0 7 I've been feeling a lot of self doubt lately.  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Me too, winter can be rough.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Do the people around you value your work?  EOS 3 0 10 Tell me about it/  EOS 3 0 11 I'd say so, yes.  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes I get seasonal depression during winter, I'd say it's relatively common.  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] If they value your work, then you must be objectively doing okay. Maybe you shouldn't be so hard on yourself.  EOS 3 0 14 Yep, SAD is not fun. For me it's year-round though  EOS 3 0 15 Maybe. I push myself a lot to the point where it is detrimental at times.  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried exercise? Research shows it can help with depression. Depression can be caused by atrophy of certain brain regions... Getting the blood flowing can help. 
[reference_response]	have you tried exercise? research shows it can help with depression. depression can be caused by atrophy of certain brain regions... getting the blood flowing can help.

[contxt]	3 0 2 My husband has been laid off for 2 months and unemployment benefits only cover half of what he was making.  EOS 3 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Just hearing that, I can imagine what a scary time this is.  EOS 3 0 4 Yes, and I have lots of kids and they are working in essential services so not only do i have to worry about covid but i have to worry about my kids getting covid.  EOS 3 0 5 i can't wait until this pandemic is over and things can get back to normal.  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Do your kids understand how helpful wearing a mask can be?  EOS 3 0 7 They do. They wear masks while at work but they still have boyfriends and they don't wear mask with friends or boyfriends.  EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So sometimes you worry that they aren't doing enough to protect themselves.  EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I know I'm more worried about others than I am about myself right now.  EOS 3 0 10 Yes, and they are young so they do not understand how important it is to practice social distancing and wear a mask. We have had so many covid tests. Luckily they have all been negative.  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe just reminding them that wearing masks protects both them and others could help? They sure wouldn't want to infect you or your husband, or others.  EOS 3 0 12 I do but they are young and the young are selfish. I'm not worried about getting covid. I'm worried about having to quarantine at home and not work. i supervise 15 people and if I get exposed I can't work for 3 weeks.  EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is really relatable. I can understand how scary it is for you, especially with your husband's pay cut.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] What if you talk to a close friend when your anxiety is especially difficult ?  EOS 3 0 15 Yes, there is nothing to do but keep putting what foot in front of the other and doing the next best thing.  EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] And with the holidays, I think it's really hitting a lot of us even harder right now. I feel that way too.  EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Have any of your coworkers gotten covid?  EOS 3 0 18 Right. I hope we make it through the holidays without the pandemic getting even more out of control than it already is.  EOS 3 0 19 I have had some coworkers at my location exposed to COVID and have to quarantine. At some of our other locations I have had coworkers get COVID and have to quarantine.  EOS 3 0 20 My workplace is safe with PPE so I do not worry about getting covid from coworkers.  EOS 3 1 21 [Others] I'm glad you're safe in that regard.  EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Is your husband working out of home or out in the field/office?  EOS 3 0 23 I had one poor coworker get exposed to covid twice. She has been gone off and on for over 2 months.  EOS 3 0 24 My husband does construction and has been laid off for a couple of months. Construction has gone down because of the pandemic. Everyone has put a halt to projects.  EOS 3 1 25 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, I understand now. I thought he still how part time work. I can imagine how scary that is for you.  EOS 3 1 26 [Self-disclosure] My husband's work was at a standstill until summer. It is better but shows signs of slowing down too. 
[reference_response]	my husband's work was at a standstill until summer. it is better but shows signs of slowing down too.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hello, I am looking for help in managing some depression.  EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You've come to a good place to start.  EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed?  EOS 3 0 4 I am feeling resentful towards my husband for quitting his job, and my son for being the reason that he quit his job.  EOS 3 0 5 My son's behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us  EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I'm sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband's loss of work and your son's loss of his job is entirely understandable.  EOS 3 0 7 I have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. It's hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future.  EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household.

EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Have you considered applying for a job or trying uber drive/ eats?  EOS 0 0 8 I have. But I have health conditions that would mean Covid-19 would be very risky for me to get. So, I'm trying to work online. I'm trying to stay encouraged.  EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand how you feel, it's tough not being able to work and earn much money.

You can also hang out with friends and talk to them about how you feel  EOS 0 0 15 It has been days since I even sat on the porch. And weeks since I took a walk.  EOS 0 1 16 [Others] you should definitely do that. staying indoor will worsen your mentality  EOS 0 0 17 That's a good idea. What sort of projects are you working on? Job? Hobby?

EOS 3 0 3 I have been feeling very depressed and i don't know what to do.  EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I understand. May I please know what is the cause of your depression?  EOS 3 0 5 I think the state of the world and not being able to go to work  EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Yes. The world is in a pretty bad place due to the pandemic. It has caused infinite sufferings to numerous people.  EOS 3 0 7 How do I handle that/  EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] We are all in this together. With proper emotional support, each of us can overcome these turbulent times.  EOS 3 0 9 Any suggestions on things I can do? I feel so overwhelmed  EOS 3 1 10 [Information] It may seem pretty bad now with the cold weather setting in at many parts of the world. But there is a vaccine coming soon.  EOS 3 0 11 I really do hope so, it's a glimmer of hope  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Think about the positive aspects of an effective vaccine. Do not stress too much about factors outside your control.  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] I know we can feel helpless at some times, but try to focus on things under YOUR control - like following health professional advise - masks, social distancing and general sanitization  EOS 3 0 14 That's true!! The masks and social distancing are very ehlpful. It's good to feel like i am doing my part.  EOS 3 0 15 Not seeing family for the holidays will be very hard!!  EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I agree. Family is our only an true source of strength. Being away from them can be really hard. But atleast, thanks to technology, they are only a video/phone call away.  EOS 3 1 17 [Information] Regarding your job, I know a lot of jobs and industries have been affected. But at the same time, it has exploded demand in personal delivery services.  EOS 3 1 18 [Question] If you are able to drive, would you be willing to explore the option of part time grocery/food delivery driver?  EOS 3 0 19 My business has been really busy but i am happy to have the distraction  EOS 3 0 20 I miss going into the office and seeing people. it's very lonely  EOS 3 1 21 [Others] Oh that's good to hear!

EOS 3 0 46 If there was no virus... maybe Scotland or Las Vegas to see some shows. Or up into Canada. (I'm in Pennsylvania.)  EOS 3 1 47 [Self-disclosure] Thank you so much! We broke up several months ago and I'm already feeling and doing so much better. I am also much better off without that person in my life. I've gained weight back that I couldn't really afford to lose to begin with, I've been more motivated, etc. It really was for the best even though the breakup itself was really difficult.  EOS 3 1 48 [Others] I live in Pennsylvania as well! It's such a small world!  EOS 3 0 49 My breakup was a few months ago too. I'm in the Poconos. :)  EOS 3 1 50 [Others] I've always wanted to go to Las Vegas. My brother and his girlfriend just took a trip out there not too long ago.  EOS 3 0 51 I've been to Las Vegas about fifteen times. I love it there. I eat, go to shows, go to baseball games... it's awesome.  EOS 3 1 52 [Others] Oh wow! I live right outside of Philadelphia. I have several friends who have houses on Lake Wallenpaupack. It's beautiful up there!  EOS 3 0 53 Wow, that's maybe an hour from me. I grew up outside of Reading. I live right by Blue Mountain.  EOS 3 1 54 [Others] That's so cool! I've never been on a plane and I've never been anywhere north or west of Pennsylvania. I've been in every state from PA down to Florida, but nowhere else. I really need to travel more!  EOS 3 1 55 [Providing Suggestions] That sounds like a beautiful area. Have you considered going skiing, snowboarding, or snow tubing since you live right near Blue Mountain?  EOS 3 0 56 Omg, yes. Travel! I've been to some really strange places. It's awesome. lol  EOS 3 1 57 [Others] I went snow tubing at Blue Mountain once. It was so much fun!  EOS 3 0 58 I haven't, but maybe I should! I teach, and I always have students who work there. lol  EOS 3 0 59 Come to think of it, they might sabotage my tube. lol  EOS 3 0 60 That's a really good idea though. Thanks. I always see groupons for tubing, too.  EOS 3 1 61 [Providing Suggestions] You should look into it! It was a lot of fun when I went. I believe they're still open right now even though COVID is still going on. It took my mind off of everything while I was there.  EOS 3 0 62 Yes, they are open. I got an email yesterday or today that they're making snow now.  EOS 3 1 63 [Others] Groupon is awesome! You're very welcome. I'm happy to help you think of things that you can do to make yourself feel better.  EOS 3 0 64 Let's go tubing! lol j/k  EOS 3 1 65 [Others] Wow! That's great to know! I might look into taking a trip up there myself with my daughter. She's 12 years old. She would absolutely love it!  EOS 3 0 66 I miss getting together with friends. And live music and live sports.  EOS 3 1 67 [Others] I would love to! That truly does sound like a lot of fun!  EOS 3 1 68 [Others] I do too! I also love live music and I REALLY like football. GO EAGLES!  EOS 3 0 69 I love hockey. I have season tickets to the WB Penguins, but they haven't played since March.  EOS 3 0 70 Hit me up at randythepoet at gmail! :)  EOS 3 0 71 It's almost 30 minutes. Thank you!

I am having trouble figuring out how to handel a situation with a friend.  EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah, can you give me a few more details? I am sure I will be able to help/  EOS 0 0 5 Her husband was justshot and kiled over a drug deal. He was high on drugs at the time. My dayghter and his daughter are good friends and we carpool with them every day. He was often the driver not my friend. Was he high when he was driving my daughter arround? Did my friend know he was on drugs?  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow that is a tough one - I can see why you would be concerned about it. At least, though, you can be assured that she is safe and is never going to come to any harm as a result of his driving now  EOS 0 0 7 Agreed but it is hard to not be suspicious that the mom knew something about hi actions. Yet I feel horrible that she lost her husband.  EOS 0 1 8 [Others] I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it :(  EOS 0 0 9 I know. I am trying to be supportive and help her with her kids but a part of me is still anxious that she may have played me.  EOS 0 1 10 [Others] People can hold values that to other people seem strange. She might not have considered it wrong to be driving on drugs, even though it is.  EOS 0 0 11 Very true. I really never even considered that!  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would not make it acceptable though!  EOS 0 0 13 No, absolutely not! But I never looked at it that way.  EOS 0 1 14 [Others] At least you can feel relieved that your daughter is safe now :)  EOS 0 0 15 Yes. I am very relieved. He was recently in a car accident before he died. Luckily no one was hurt and the girls were not in the car! He totaled his brand new truck though.  EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] I think the best you can do right now is just be there for your friend when she wants to talk.  EOS 0 0 17 Definitely trying to be!

That's a never ending battle for me! Do you have a lot of it?  EOS 4 0 4 Not too bad, it's more so the folding and putting away afterward that seems to take the longest.  EOS 4 1 5 [Others] That's the worst part. I've given up on folding.  EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Do you have something that's bothering this evening?  EOS 4 0 7 It does feel good to put things away though, my room has been a tornado recently, just not feeling like doing much these days. The pandemic crazies hit pretty hard recently.  EOS 4 0 8 I wish I could just see peoples faces again, and go out to eat. It really sucks to be at home all the time. Like I get it, but it's challenging, and lonely.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can relate. This whole year has been a mess.  EOS 4 0 10 I want to be optimistic but its hard when it feels like you're always on the brink of losing everything. It really sucks.  EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Do you think you're staying away from people because you're supposed to or you're afraid of getting sick?  EOS 4 0 12 I would definitely say both. I also don't live near any family or friends anymore. I moved to a totally new place a few months before the pandemic  EOS 4 0 13 Lost the job I moved here for, most of the friends I had made needed to move back in with family, it's just a mess.  EOS 4 0 14 And we're on level red these days, so most businesses are closed around here.  EOS 4 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's hard to be optimistic when everything seems so uncertain. I can't imagine how lonely that would feel especially in a new place. 
[reference_response]	it's hard to be optimistic when everything seems so uncertain. i can't imagine how lonely that would feel especially in a new place.

EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is it that is stressing you out currently?  EOS 0 0 5 I've been only doing some deliveries due to COVID, while also searching for another job because it's just not sustainable. It's stressful enough with less money, but coming up on Christmas is just giving me even more anxiety about it.  EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just so I make sure I understand, you are currently stressed about your money situation due to only working part time making deliveries for the time being.  EOS 0 0 7 Yes  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I can completely understand this, as I was also extremely worried about money when the pandemic first started and about not being able to be employed.  EOS 0 0 9 It's so hard to find something else right now.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Have you looked into hiring agencies to help you find a more permanent job during the pandemic? Hiring agencies are a great resource to find a job that fist you best.  EOS 0 0 11 I have recently been in contact with one around here. It unfortunately just hasn't happened as quickly as I wished. Although that's life. I'm hoping that it will progress.  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] After interviewing with a company are you following up on a timeline or a decision? Companies like to see initiative in their potential hires after an interview.  EOS 0 0 13 That's definitely something I'm lacking. I need to be better about that because I'm sure it will help.  EOS 0 1 14 [Others] It definitely does help to make sure you are following up!  EOS 0 0 15 When is a decent amount of time to follow up?  EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I usually wait a week before I reach out.  EOS 0 0 17 Thank you, that is really helpful advice.  EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Not a problem! I know this is an incredibly difficult situation, but I know you can make it through!  EOS 0 0 19 Thank you, I know this crazy year has been hard on a lot of people for different reasons.  EOS 0 1 20 [Others] Yes it has!

[contxt]	0 0 2 I'm not feeling great. I applied for a job recently which took a lot of time. I now have an interview and it's in 3 days. I'm getting really nervous about this because I think I need longer to prepare.  EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I know how you feel, I have often felt anxiety before a job interview.  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What makes you feel that you are unprepared?  EOS 0 0 5 The thing is I'm really good at interviews but usually it takes time to prepare. It's a corporate interview so I need to prepare behavioural answers to certain scenarios. In the past this has taken me a week to learn and record to memory  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Is it possible that you could get a friend or family member to work with you on your responses? That could possibly speed up your preparation time.  EOS 0 0 7 Yes perhaps. I need to draw on previous experience so I think I'll need to prepare. I'm just so busy at work these days I just don;t think I'll have the time.  EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I can see that you are feeling a large amount of stress about the situation.  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Would it be possible to take one or more days off from work to give yourself more time?  EOS 0 0 10 Yes this is very stressful. Have you ever had a similar experience and if so how did you handle it?  EOS 0 0 11 Potentially but this is very short notice, usually I have to provide more notice for leave from work.  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I have had to deal with time pressures quite a few times. I am sure most people have in the modern era where everything moves so fast. I have usually gotten help from friends, or done my best to delay or remove other commitments from my life. As a last resort, I have sometimes had to accept that I would be getting less sleep than usual for a few days.  EOS 0 1 13 [Question] Are there any other commitments that you can possibly delay or remove from your life while you prepare for your job interview?  EOS 0 0 14 Perhaps I can ask if I can finish early from work for the next couple of days and get some time that way. I do think however I'll be more nervous due to less time to prepare. The thing is I'd delay the interview but this might affect my chances.  EOS 0 0 15 I suppose I could ask my partner to look after the childcare for the next couple of days.  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems. You seem like a hard working, diligent type of person that can make this work if you make the effort.  EOS 0 0 17 Tanks , I think I need to stay positive about this. Not sure how to handle my interview nerves however?  EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help. If you prepare as much as possible in the time that you have, you can be confident that you have done your best, and that is all that matters. You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident.  EOS 0 1 19 [Question] Do you think any of these ideas might help? 
[reference_response]	do you think any of these ideas might help?
[hypothesis_response]	maybe you should ask your partner to do a little of everything in his underwear. that might make it easier for you to see them as you would want them to.

EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I understand that being honest is important. I always feel the need to share with my husband. Do you think this information will do more harm than good if shared? 
[reference_response]	i understand that being honest is important. i always feel the need to share with my husband. do you think this information will do more harm than good if shared?
[hypothesis_response]	well, you're not making her mad, but you've made it clear that you don't want to be honest with your husband. you want her to be, but don'; t tell her that you are not being serious and that you'd rather be honest.

EOS 0 0 12 That's a good idea, I guess I could start there.  EOS 0 0 13 I am so worried, I can't get a hold of my emotions  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Yes you should do that until you can find another job  EOS 0 0 15 Okay, I'll apply on line today.  EOS 0 0 16 How can I deal with my stress?  EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] don't worry yourself to much it is going to be okay it is really a tough time that everyone is going through right now  EOS 0 0 18 That makes me feel a little better.

EOS 0 0 21 I will also try to improve my resume.  EOS 0 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] you are most definitely not alone  EOS 0 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] yes try to improve your resume to that will be a good idea  EOS 0 0 24 So, to recap- today, I'll apply for unemployment. Then, I'll use the extra time to polish up my resume.

EOS 5 1 3 [Others] Oh no, that's not good  EOS 5 0 4 I am disgusted....just like President Donald Trump is with the $600 dollar stimulus checks.  EOS 5 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ain't that the truth.  EOS 5 0 6 It just isn't my fault.  EOS 5 0 7 My wife had no right to leave California without me.  EOS 5 0 8 I made a mistake making California my home.  EOS 5 1 9 [Question] I'm sure it isn't, how long had you been together?  EOS 5 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] California is beautiful I know, but it can also be pretty quick paced.  EOS 5 0 11 We were together 10 years. I am just disgusted that it had to happen at this point. Christmas week, of all weeks.  EOS 5 1 12 [Others] Are you still working?  EOS 5 0 13 I am still working right now. Luckily, California has plenty of money for bureacrats lie myself.  EOS 5 0 14 I contributed to the marriage for sure.  EOS 5 0 15 I love my wife and my great kids  EOS 5 1 16 [Others] It's important that you know that you can feel whatever way you need to about your loss. Its a tough time of year for something like that.  EOS 5 1 17 [Question] Had things been pretty rocky?  EOS 5 0 18 Things like this were sudden. I mean, I never expected her to up and walk out with the kids.  EOS 5 0 19 The only thing I can think of was that California was getting too expensive and the homeless were taking over LA; that may have spooked her to leave the state.  EOS 5 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] Wow, that's horrible. It seems you should have some kind of legal authority in that aspect.  EOS 5 1 21 [Question] Is that a big problem out there?  EOS 5 0 22 I really don't have any discourse. The kids are almost 18. They are twins. Yeah, in her eyes, she seems fed up with the state. She left me for Texas, the state, not the person.  EOS 5 0 23 I mean, she never mentioned loving, "Text," but the kids are bing into the Dallas Cowboys  EOS 5 1 24 [Others] It is important that you understand that it seems that she has been thinking of this for a while.  EOS 5 0 25 I overhead her say that Texas is a free state and my twin boys do love the Dallas Cowboy's team.  EOS 5 1 26 [Question] Does she have family there?  EOS 5 0 27 Yes, she does. Both her parents live in Laredo.....big spread, too.  EOS 5 1 28 [Question] Have you spoken with her since she left?  EOS 5 0 29 Well, she left two days ago. I came home and the furniture and my widescreen TV were all gone.  EOS 5 0 30 We lived in a small apartment in LA.  EOS 5 1 31 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That's mid-boggling..  EOS 5 0 32 I am D-I-S-G-U-S-T-E-D to the Nth degree.  EOS 5 1 33 [Others] Do you have any hobbies?  EOS 5 0 34 Any help to get her to come back would help.  EOS 5 0 35 My hobbies are on hold.....I need to get "un-disgusted" first.  EOS 5 1 36 [Providing Suggestions] Well, I can't make her come back, but I can provide you with some information on how to get through these tough times.  EOS 5 0 37 ok.  EOS 5 0 38 I am all ears.....  EOS 5 1 39 [Others] I understand, it can be good to help get some stress out in other ways. Do you excercise?  EOS 5 1 40 [Providing Suggestions] What kind of hobbies do you have?  EOS 5 0 41 I have a gym membership....if they are even open with the COVID-19.  EOS 5 0 42 Maybe I can just jog or speed walk every day. Perhaps pushups can help?  EOS 5 1 43 [Self-disclosure] I like to run every morning, and it seems to help make alot of stress evaporate. 
[reference_response]	i like to run every morning, and it seems to help make alot of stress evaporate.

[contxt]	3 1 2 [Question] I'm doing really well, thanks. What brings you here today?  EOS 3 0 3 I'm just having some old thoughts about a past relationship. IT's making me sad  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I can appreciate that. Thinking about lost loves makes me sad too!  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] What about this particular relationship makes you feel sad?  EOS 3 0 6 Yeahhh I re read some old messages from a while back and just started thinking about it again. IT's going to sound quite dramatic, but I regret breaking up with this person. I feel as though they were my soulmate. And I ruined it  EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh...I see, you think s/he's the "one who got away?"  EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Why did you break up?  EOS 3 0 9 Pretty much... but the dumb thing about that is I am the one who broke it off. I was with him since beginning of high school, and so I never knew anything other than him. But Earlier this year I was having second thoughts and thought we should try new things for a while. In the beginning, I was doing fine and he was having a really hard time. But now I miss him more than anything and he is now better off without me  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow...that does sound painful.  EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I know how hard it is to let go of a guy you really loved. I've had to break up with a few of them over the years!  EOS 3 0 12 Yeah? Do you miss any of them? Or do you feel like it was right for you in the long run  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] In the long run, I feel that those break-ups were absolutely necessary. I'm in a really good place now. And they are too.  EOS 3 0 14 Yeah that is good. That is everything that I'm hoping for. But it's not coming fast enough  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I eventually learned to think of it like this: every man I loved taught me something important about myself. ANd I taught them things about themselves. ANd it doesn't happen overnight. But eventually, you will probably be able to see how you grew as a result of the breakup.  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe the things you will learn can help you be ready for Mr Right!  EOS 3 0 17 I really appreciate that way of looking at it. Of course I will always cherish my memories and the things I learned from him. And I want to think of those things as happy experiences rather than sad memories  EOS 3 1 18 [Others] That's a really good way of looking at it.  EOS 3 0 19 How long did it typically take you to finalyl be over them and happy with what you ecperienced?  EOS 3 1 20 [Others] Oohh.... I think it really depended on how long I was with them. ANd why I decided to end it. The longer relationships Maybe a few weeks to a few months before I was ready to move on and try again. BUt Only a fraction of that was crying with Ben & Jerry's!  EOS 3 0 21 Hahaha yes. That really does help honestly !  EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] For me it just happened that one day, I thought about Gary and I didn't really feel that sad anymore.

[contxt]	4 1 14 [Others] ok. dealing with someone with bi-polar disorder can be really tough and challenging but it is not there fault that they are acting the way they are. They just honestly can not help it. I know you are doing everything you can to help him and to stop him from acting that way.  EOS 4 0 15 You're right. Mental illness, in all of its forms, is especially challenging. Physical illness is more easy to understand, of course.  EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] you are right. So do not think he is doing it on purpose. Do not let it bring you down or hurt your feelings in anyway.  EOS 4 1 17 [Information] When did this exactly start happening?  EOS 4 0 18 Thank you. I think you understand the sadness and anxiety in feeling powerless in this situation (or mostly powerless). I have no real expertise in this area, but by contacting his doctor, maybe he can reevaluate whether the medicine and dosage needs to be changed.  EOS 4 0 19 Funny you ask. He's a grown man - 35-years old. I've never known him to have this issue, which seems so strange to me.  EOS 4 1 20 [Others] I understand a lot.  EOS 4 0 21 It started about 14 months ago - at least that's when people started alerting me to strange behavior. I thought people who were bi-polar contracted the illness earlier in their life.  EOS 4 1 22 [Information] How long have you known about his bi polar diorder?  EOS 4 0 23 Around 10 months ago is when I first found out. Since then, I've received about 5 phone calls from people expressing concern. I've visited him 3 times.  EOS 4 0 24 Thanks for being so engaged and sympathetic.

EOS 4 0 26 Before we end the conversation, I'd love hearing a few of those suggestions, if you don't mind.  EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions] ok. just be there for him no matter what because you know he can not help it. Be understanding of his mental illness.

[contxt]	0 0 0 I'm so worried about breaking up with my boyfriend that I find myself shaking at night.  EOS 0 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry you are going through that. Why do you think you are worried?  EOS 0 0 2 I just miss the physical comfort and support.  EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I have also struggled with that in the past. It can be difficult!  EOS 0 0 4 Yes, I feel so lonely  EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] Can you think of things that don't make you feel lonely? We can work on focusing on those instead.  EOS 0 0 6 Yes, I guess I could try to turn things around to a positive focus on what I do have.  EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's a great idea. I think you will be headed in the right direction doing that.  EOS 0 0 8 How do I stop the shaking at night? Do you have suggestions?  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] I would work on making sure you are in a positive mindset before you go to bed and try to focus on the things you can control.  EOS 0 0 10 Maybe I could think of things in my life like my new nephew to cheer me up! He is so cute and makes me smile.  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a wonderful idea. You are on the right track with that. You should try to think about him before bed and see if it help tonight!  EOS 0 0 12 I wish I were home and not in college though but I guess I am growing up and will learn from this to make me stronger.  EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also struggled with that when I was in college. Being away from home is hard but you have to remember that you can do hard things!  EOS 0 0 14 I need to remember that college is only temporary and I will have their support in the future again in person. It's just so hard.

But also, you have their support, it just might look a little different at this time.

I did alot of damage to our relationship when I was drinking and i'm not sure it will ever be the same  EOS 0 1 8 [Others] Could you be transferring feelings because she has been there for you through a rough time and maybe you feel understood more than you do in your marriage? Can you talk to your wife about your feelings openly?  EOS 0 0 9 about having feelings for another woman? NO...we have tried some marriage counseling apps things get better then go back.  EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry to hear that. I was also married at one time and had similar issues. We never could get passed some issued like having kids or not. I understand it can be difficult coming to terms with someone. It doesn't always work out.  EOS 0 0 11 I have changed a great deal in the past 2.5 years even though it's been for the better it's difficult for my wife to reconcile the old and new  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That makes a lot of sense and good for you. That's an awesome testament to your hard work.Does your mentor feel the same way about you?  EOS 0 0 13 I never intended to have these feelings for my friend...it just developed over time.

[contxt]	1 0 0 Hey  EOS 1 1 1 [Question] How ae you feeling today? Is there anything you need to talk about?  EOS 1 0 2 I feel drained, honestly. I'd love to talk about my current dilemma in my friend circle.  EOS 1 1 3 [Question] Can you share the dilemma you are having?  EOS 1 0 4 Basically. This has happened for as long as I can remember, even back when I was a little kid. Any friend i've ever had has just used me for SOME gain. Whether that be boredom, money, or an emotional support pillow. I'm so sick of it. They'll literally ignore me for months and randomly text me for money. If i respond theyll read my messages then ignore me until they need money again. Or, they'll use me to throw alllll their problems onto me and never do the same for me. In some way shape or form- every person I become friends with uses me and throws me away when theyre done.  EOS 1 0 5 Sometimes I feel like it must be me. Maybe i',m annoying? This happens so often the common denominator is ME. But i'm friendly, im assertive, im out spoken, im kind. I don't LET people walk all over me but it seems like that;s all I attract.  EOS 1 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel under valued in your relationships because people tend to take advantage of you. 
[reference_response]	so you feel under valued in your relationships because people tend to take advantage of you.
[hypothesis_response]	i can imagine. i have had similar experiences with friends like that. it's normal for them to use you for money, not for any other reason.

EOS 5 0 3 I have testing all the time and study non-stop, but the professors don't seem to encourage or support me. They just see me as a number I feel.  EOS 5 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's hard to feel like they are treating you like a number when you are working so hard. Have you talked to them about it?

EOS 2 0 9 I have family but they live on the west coast im on the eastcoast  EOS 2 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I get that. It can be really frustrating when you feel alone and like you've got no one to talk to. Especially when 2020 seems to be dumping things on you.  EOS 2 1 11 [Question] What have you been doing to pass the time? Is there anything that you've found that makes you feel better?

[contxt]	4 0 7 we have been together for 3 years  EOS 4 0 8 he doesn't know that i know  EOS 4 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I'm so sorry to hear this. You must be full of all kinds of emotions now. What are your plans?  EOS 4 0 10 i don't know yet tbh.  EOS 4 0 11 i have never been cheated on before.  EOS 4 0 12 we also live together so it's complicated  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand your frustration. It happened to me before. And I've had girlfriends. They never change. They will apologize because they got caught, but they never really change.  EOS 4 0 14 But, how do I know for sure if he did cheat?  EOS 4 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's going to be very painful for a while because you have been invested 3 years in this relationship. Do you have friends to talk to that can encourage and support you?  EOS 4 0 16 The messages were about meeting up for a photoshoot at the brooklyn bridge.  EOS 4 0 17 is that cheating because he lied  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I find if they flirt, they already have cheated. Loyalty is something inside a person, or not. Very few will look inside themselves and see why they do this and want to change. If you were married, you would need counseling.  EOS 4 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] Do you meet up with your exes?  EOS 4 0 20 i'm still friends with many of my exes, but he knows that and we all hang out together  EOS 4 0 21 thats why it's weird that he lied  EOS 4 1 22 [Others] He lied because he didn't want you to know the truth. Which is betrayal.  EOS 4 0 23 also, when he gets home, how do i tell him how i found out.  EOS 4 0 24 i mean, i literally got into his facebook without asking  EOS 4 0 25 i just had this intuition that he was being suspicious  EOS 4 1 26 [Others] It's a hot mess, is it not? Why did you feel you wanted to spy on him? Did you already mistrust him?  EOS 4 0 27 well, it was weird that he got so dressed up to go hang out with friends  EOS 4 0 28 it makes sense now that i know he went for a photoshoot  EOS 4 1 29 [Self-disclosure] Ok, so this is a HUGE red flag to you. You can ignore it, or not. Women KNOW when a man is cheating, so you had that inside of you. And you went with your hunch and now you have found he is dishonest.  EOS 4 1 30 [Question] Was the photoshoot to have pictures of him?  EOS 4 0 31 yeah, she's a photographer  EOS 4 0 32 she took all his headshots when he first moved to America, actually  EOS 4 0 33 when they were together  EOS 4 1 34 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I suppose it could be Christmas pictures of him for you? Or not. I personally feel honesty is the best policy, no matter what. I would come clean. I would tell him I sensed trouble and looked for it and found it.  EOS 4 0 35 i worry that i am jumping to conclusions.  EOS 4 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You could be, but then you wouldn't have a feeling of mistrust, you would just be sensing a surprise.  EOS 4 0 37 he may say: you are friends with ur exes, why can't i be friends with mine?  EOS 4 0 38 he never said which friends he was going to see  EOS 4 0 39 he also didnt offer to take me with him, though  EOS 4 0 40 i always invite him when i hang out with my exes  EOS 4 1 41 [Question] He could say that. And if he is lying, do you think he will begin to be honest? You will have to judge for yourself. If he is lying, he will continue to lie. And you will feel it inside of yourself. Is this the first time you felt this way? Or has this happened before? 
[reference_response]	he could say that. and if he is lying, do you think he will begin to be honest? you will have to judge for yourself. if he is lying, he will continue to lie. and you will feel it inside of yourself. is this the first time you felt this way? or has this happened before?

[contxt]	5 0 0 Hi can you help me with my problem?  EOS 5 1 1 [Question] Hello. What's on your mind?  EOS 5 0 2 I'm disgusted with my friend for cheating on her boyfriend. Am I right to feel this way?  EOS 5 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your feelings are valid, no matter what they are.  EOS 5 1 4 [Question] Why do you think you're disgusted with her?  EOS 5 0 5 Because she's not acting the way she should be acting.  EOS 5 0 6 Her boyfriend is a nice guy so he doesn't deserve this treatment  EOS 5 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like she did something you find really immoral.  EOS 5 1 8 [Question] Is their relationship generally pretty good, to your knowledge?  EOS 5 0 9 Yeah, but I'm also thinking it's not my business. I should just stay out of it.  EOS 5 0 10 Well I thought it was good until that happened. He doesn't know. So I just feel gross around them.  EOS 5 1 11 [Question] Have you talked to your friend about what she did?  EOS 5 0 12 Yeah, she doesn't really care because she's not going to tell him. I'm questioning whether I should still be friends with her.  EOS 5 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You're definite right to be questioning if this is the sort of person you want to be friends with.  EOS 5 0 14 It's hard to stop thought because we work at the same place.  EOS 5 0 15 though..  EOS 5 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] If her behavior is getting to you like this, I definitely suggest you try to keep some distance from her as much as you can.  EOS 5 0 17 Yeah, I've been trying to, but she's always talking to me  EOS 5 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] It might be a good idea to explain why you're upset with her, even though that's likely to upset her.  EOS 5 0 19 I guess, but I'd rather just avoid her.  EOS 5 0 20 I'm thinking if I ignore her then she  EOS 5 0 21 she'll get the hint  EOS 5 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] I can definitely understand wanting to avoid a confrontation.  EOS 5 0 23 Yeah, I realize she's quite selfish so confronting her wouldn't help.  EOS 5 1 24 [Question] What do you think you can do to minimize your contact with her? 
[reference_response]	what do you think you can do to minimize your contact with her?
[hypothesis_response]	i know it'd be hard to understand, but you can always try to avoid her by avoiding her. i think it might make a difference.

[contxt]	0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] School can be very demanding. What has you stressed?  EOS 0 0 4 yeah just trying to speed through the readings as I still have more than a few units to read through  EOS 0 1 5 [Information] All nighters can be rough. Do you have snacks and caffeine?  EOS 0 0 6 and meanwhile, have one assignment from this course also at the end of this month, and another course's assignment, and that course's exam is coming up next month.  EOS 0 0 7 yeah just trying to load myself up with coffee.  EOS 0 0 8 I am used to the idea of staying up because I have been doing that since the pandemic early on this year, but I seem to be distracted and procrastinating, especially in the early hours of the morning, and just go on the computer and waste time, etc.  EOS 0 0 9 it's kind of hard to sit myself down I guess  EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can master it within in a month, you are already getting a head start  EOS 0 0 11 yeah this is my third go through the entire course, the third round of studying. So that the knowledge would be fresh in my mind.  EOS 0 0 12 just the entire next week is all I have left to get through like 6 units of readings  EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes the pandemic has created a lot of challenges for routines and schedules  EOS 0 0 14 plus finish up the assignment and I have a part-time job, and plus doing some catching with the other course which is all due next month after this course.  EOS 0 0 15 yeah it sure has.  EOS 0 0 16 I can go on and on about that too  EOS 0 1 17 [Question] I am confident you can succeed, it sounds like you have a plan and dedication  EOS 0 0 18 And another thing is by the time I get wise up to not procrastinate, like around 3 or 4 am, I become tired and sleepy, and my brain kicks in and immediately doesn't cooperate. So just a pattern of that going on lately.  EOS 0 0 19 thanks just gonna do my very best and be mature and catch up because my marks have been good but have been procrastinating, lazy, and slow with everything since the pandemic.

I think that we all need to come together and help each other at this time.  EOS 0 0 10 anytime, true true  EOS 0 0 11 i have applied to Appen a few times, and they always say there is no position available now  EOS 0 1 12 [Information] Are you aware that there are organisations that can offer a little help at this time? Food banks for instance, though I know some people feel awkward about accepting such help.  EOS 0 0 13 ah yes, food banks, yeah I never thought about it but free food always helps.  EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have had to use foodbanks once or twice this year and I did feel a bit bad about it but everyone there was very kind and no-one judged us.  EOS 0 0 15 If i lose my main job I will use it  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There is nothing to be ashamed of in doing so and when you get to a better position you can give back to them.

EOS 2 0 3 I've made an accident at work in the warehouse 2 days ago and didn't report it. I have fear and anxiety that if management will find out I will get in trouble  EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Why didn't you report it?  EOS 2 0 5 I don't know now, I've just started there 1 month ago and probably I thought I will lose my job straight away  EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] You should report it because at least the boss knows that you are honest with your actions.  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don't think you won't lose it straight away if it is your first mistake  EOS 2 0 8 Yes I know and I regret it now, but I think to go report now it's too late  EOS 2 1 9 [Others] It's never too late, and it would be better to do it now than let him find out himself :)  EOS 2 0 10 On a training they told that need to report any accident straight away and if delay it will result in losing job for sure  EOS 2 0 11 I know I did wrong and it bothers me as I don't want to lose my job  EOS 2 1 12 [Others] Yes but if you report it now you still have a chance of being let off, but if u don't report it now, you would almost certainly lose your job.  EOS 2 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] In any case, always prepare for the worst circumstance at this point  EOS 2 0 14 But also there is a chance they will not find out?  EOS 2 1 15 [Information] They most likely will, so it is better not to use that chance  EOS 2 0 16 It's quite large warehouse and I know they have old cameras there  EOS 2 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] In any case, it is always better to tell the truth, because you don't want to have the truth boiling up inside of you for a long time. Thats what I say  EOS 2 0 18 Yeah I guess you are right. I just don't know what to do if I lose my job as now it's very hard to find a job  EOS 2 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Knowing the severity of the mistake, i think you should tell as good things come to people who are honest :)  EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] But about your depression, try to occupy yourself with more work and maybe your boss will see that you have changed your ways  EOS 2 0 21 Well knowing me the luck is not always on my side  EOS 2 0 22 Should I report at start of the shift or end of the shift what do you think?  EOS 2 1 23 [Others] I think you should work extremely hard during the shift so the boss thinks you have changed your ways, at the end of the shift

EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night.  EOS 4 0 4 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now.  EOS 4 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well?  EOS 4 0 6 Today was my one-year anniversary with my boyfriend.  EOS 4 0 7 He broke up with me today.  EOS 4 0 8 We were at school (our college campus), and we had a huge fight.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run.  EOS 4 0 10 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don't know what to do with myself.  EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation.  EOS 4 0 12 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately.  EOS 4 0 13 That's true, but that doesn't make me feel any better about it right now.  EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress.  EOS 4 0 15 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays.  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts?  EOS 4 0 17 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate.  EOS 4 0 18 I suppose I just need to practice more.  EOS 4 1 19 [Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind.  EOS 4 0 20 Like the Calm app?  EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma.  EOS 4 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, the Calm app is one.  EOS 4 0 23 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately.  EOS 4 0 24 What else can I do besides meditation?  EOS 4 1 25 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds?  EOS 4 0 26 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick.  EOS 4 0 27 Candles are much better for me.  EOS 4 1 28 [Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. 
[reference_response]	there are websites like decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil.

EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I could understand how that could make you very angry, I would be too.  EOS 1 0 5 Have you ever ran into something like that before?  EOS 1 1 6 [Question] I have not, it sounds like a very bad situation. Is there anyone you can report this to at the company?  EOS 1 0 7 Not really. My coworker and I can complain but that can only go so far. I need to detach and do the work but my ego is hurt.  EOS 1 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are working in a toxic work environment with poor leadership. Have you considered possibly seeking another job? Or maybe another company?  EOS 1 0 9 Not really. This just started happening last week. I'm still trying to get a better idea on how to deal with this.  EOS 1 1 10 [Others] I understand. What do you think about having a conversation with the board and let them know the issues you are having? You could have your coworker back you up.  EOS 1 0 11 I think that is how I am going to respond. I am also hearing this from my staff, which may be part of the problem. I am trying not to let my ego get involved but it is hard.  EOS 1 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you take a lot of pride in your job which is very amiable. I think confronting the board is the best way to go about this.  EOS 1 0 13 I am worried that I will not be received well. Should I be?  EOS 1 1 14 [Others] It's very possible, but I think you will be commended amongst your peers. You owe it to yourself not to be walked all over.  EOS 1 0 15 That's true... I need that at least.

[contxt]	3 0 1 So im struggling to figure things out in my life. I feel lost and im not sure if its just the depression or if its more.  EOS 3 0 2 Im hanging in there. Thanks for asking. How are you?  EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I'm good, but has anything happened for you to feel like this or are you in your feelings right now?  EOS 3 0 4 Nothing specifically. My life is very good i just happen to always become depressed, unmotivated and sad most the time. It creates issues in all aspects from friendships to my relationship and even my personal and professional life.  EOS 3 0 5 Im seeking mental health therapy as well as focusing on a number of other things ranging from sleep, diet, communication, social life and numerous things but happen to always feel the same way. Do you have any input?  EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you are mental therapy is a good idea as I don't think your mind is as straight as it needs to be, it will be alright especially if your life is good  EOS 3 0 7 It is a good idea and provides some insight on things that maybe i havent thought about before. Have you ever experienced depression thats lasted for long periods at a time?  EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Yh, when I was in college i did go through that stage as I couldn't find a job  EOS 3 0 9 Ive found that exercise and diet helps greatly. But even then i still suffer. So your depression was situational?  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It was kinda like yours in the sense that nothing triggered it but it worked out somehow so yours will as well :)  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] If it is exercise and diet that helps you, go for it!  EOS 3 0 12 Well in your case you mentioned it occurred because you couldnt find a job. Isnt that situational depression?  EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] No but I had another source of income so it only effected me a little. But i persevered through it so can you  EOS 3 0 14 But in my case everything around me is better than the average but even so i still become depressed frequently and unmotivated. Ive tried medication and every type of treatment. I feel like there isnt much of a cure. Seems to be treatment resistant.  EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you should start medication because perhaps your head isn't in the right place  EOS 3 0 16 Thanks and maybe so. Ive tried many but i suppose maybe focusing on specific ones might do.  EOS 3 0 17 Do you think support groups could be beneficial?  EOS 3 0 18 Or do you have any resources for such?  EOS 3 1 19 [Information] Yeah, that might be of use and it will help you see other people in your shoes 
[reference_response]	yeah, that might be of use and it will help you see other people in your shoes
[hypothesis_response]	i've done some research on the effects of medication and medication is a great way to help your mind and body.

[contxt]	0 0 1 Hey, how are you. I wish I can say I'm good but feeling down and nervous. :(  EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Oh I am so sorry. Please know that I am happy to listen! What is going on with you?  EOS 0 0 3 I'm about to lose my current job, because my contract is about to expire. I don't have another job offer on the line.  EOS 0 1 4 [Providing Suggestions] Is there no possibility of having your contract renewed?  EOS 0 0 5 They honored my current contract, but due to rising cost and expenses they are downsizing the company.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] It could be due to the pandemic, I suppose. Are you in touch with government agencies who could help you due to the exceptional circumstances?  EOS 0 0 7 Yes I reached out, but unemployment won't help as much, won't cover most of my expenses. I just don't know how to deal and cope from this. I want to change my mindset but it's all at once and I can't deal with it.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I think a good place to start would be your doctor - they might be able to refer you to a counsellor.  EOS 0 0 9 I understand seeking professional help is a good move. But its more the feeling of uncertainty that I have trouble coping with. I know if I can overcome this, I can deal with it and move on. Any ideas?  EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Would you consider taking some sort of job on a temporary basis, even though it is way out of your normal field? Bar tending or something? Just to make you feel you were earning.  EOS 0 0 11 I do have side incomes, but I lost majority of my income. But I know I can find something in the future. I just need to overcome this anxiety and nervous feeling. Maybe then I can have confidence.  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Would you consider medication? It's not a panacea but it can help in the short term.  EOS 0 0 13 No medications, a bit stronger than that. I can cope without that. Probably might seek a professional and talk it out.  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Whatever you do don't go self medicating! That does not help at all.  EOS 0 1 15 [Others] I hope I have been able to give you a little bit of piece of mind and I wish you a good deal of luck in the future  EOS 0 0 16 That true, I meant I dont want any medications. Might try other coping techniques, talking, breathing.  EOS 0 1 17 [Others] That sounds like a really good idea! All the best  EOS 0 0 18 Thanks for the advice of the professional though, I think its a good start. I feel better now.  EOS 0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] Anyway thanks for talking :) Can you press the quit button as I am not allowed to my end.  EOS 0 0 20 Yes, thank you for helping and good luck with everything.  EOS 0 1 21 [Others] Glad to hear :)

[contxt]	3 0 1 hello \  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How can I help?  EOS 3 0 3 am affected by depression how can you help me  EOS 3 1 4 [Question] let's start with a few questions if that's ok. how long have you been feeling depressed?  EOS 3 0 5 2 months now  EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's Ok to feel like this and depression affects many people. I think reaching out is the best first step and I'm sure you can improve this issue  EOS 3 0 7 what am ii supposed to do in this situation  EOS 3 1 8 [Question] have you spoken to any friends or family members about how you are feeling?  EOS 3 0 9 yeah but there not helping about anything  EOS 3 1 10 [Question] has anything changed recently in your life that you think might be contributing to this feeling of depression that you are having?  EOS 3 0 11 yes i lost my job last month  EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I'm sorry to hear that. my friend lost his job about 6 months ago and he was also feeling a similar way. I think this is to be expected when you have a sudden change in circumstances however this by no means undermines the seriousness of the issue  EOS 3 0 13 so i have joined groups i thing i will be better soon  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] that's great to hear. it sounds like if you address the issue that has made you depressed in the first place this will go a long way to making you feel better about things. 
[reference_response]	that's great to hear. it sounds like if you address the issue that has made you depressed in the first place this will go a long way to making you feel better about things.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hi - I'm sorry. I stepped away from the computer for a moment while waiting...  EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's quite all right. The wait times can be a bit long. How are you?  EOS 3 0 3 Well, my manager has decided that everyone in the office will continue to work from after the pandemic is under control. But I've found myself depressed from working from home all the time.  EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Working from home is not what people expected. Many have found themselves isolated. They miss the interaction of the office. How long have you bee working from home?  EOS 3 0 5 For a full year--since March 2020, when the pandemic first started. I was working from home just 1 day per week prior to that, which I liked. But I've found that 5 days per week is much too much. I miss people. :(  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Have you and your co-workers talked to your boss about a hybrid schedule, maybe a couple days a week in the office? That might work.  EOS 3 0 7 That's where it gets awkward. It seems like everyone besides me are super happy that we'll continue working from home. I hesitate to share my feelings because maybe my manager will change her mind, which would be a big bummer for everyone else on the team (seemingly).  EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. That's a concern. So you feel that if one person goes in to the office, then everyone else will have to? There won't be any flexibility?  EOS 3 0 9 Well, it's possible that my manager will say we can be flexible. But if so, I think I'd end up being the only one in my office working... which would be just as lonely as working from home while throwing away the few perks of working from home, like saving on gas. Plus, I think my company will probably want to repurpose our office space eventually.  EOS 3 0 10 lol, sorry, that was an ugly run-on sentence. :\  EOS 3 1 11 [Information] Hm. A bit of a dilemma. Can this situation go on forever though? Maybe the boss will extend the stay-at-home for a while, but when other companies go back to the office, the expectation will be there for all companies.  EOS 3 1 12 [Information] Other employees might change their minds bit by bit as well.  EOS 3 0 13 That is indeed a possibility. But my office is in a city that has a whole lot of high-tech companies, which were moving towards doing more work from home even BEFORE the pandemic. So it kind of feels like this might be a "cultural shift" in my area in general. Although there has GOT to be a whole lot of other people who feel like I do. Maybe we should start our own company, lol.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] True. I don't think you are alone. Is there something that you can do to make working at home better for you? More frequent breaks? Better work space? 
[reference_response]	true. i don't think you are alone. is there something that you can do to make working at home better for you? more frequent breaks? better work space?
[hypothesis_response]	if you are working from a home, you should be able to find a way to make a difference in the environment. it might be good for your cohworkers to have a plan to work from your home, rather than from your own.
[comet query]	That is indeed a possibility. But my office is in a city that has a whole lot of high-tech companies, which were moving towards doing more work from home even BEFORE the pandemic.

[contxt]	0 0 20 I wonder if I should do the same...  EOS 0 0 21 My grand mother basically gave me a whole speech about how ashamed she is.  EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes it is for the best to set clear boundries.  EOS 0 0 23 But who knows.

EOS 0 1 25 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is Grand mother ashamed of you or her daughter? I feel it should be her ashamed of her daughter.  EOS 0 0 26 My grand mother is ashamed of her daughter  EOS 0 0 27 I am kind of left with a weird circumstance.  EOS 0 1 28 [Reflection of feelings] At least that is a good thing to come out of a bad situation.  EOS 0 0 29 Only reason she has a house is because I helped. And if I leave it. Everyone in my family said I would be irresponsible to let my mom lose it.  EOS 0 1 30 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I do not think that would have a reflection on you. It should only reflect on your mom.  EOS 0 0 31 Yeah, they said they already know my mother is irresponsible.  EOS 0 0 32 Instead they suggested I should provide extra financial security to myself or at least some future children.  EOS 0 0 33 Grandma already is giving a home and 2 apartments but... I guess I am the only kid. Christ.  EOS 0 0 34 My mom lost my om over 100k to be honest. It was crazy growing up to that  EOS 0 1 35 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It may be nice to have a bonus house for the future. But even that comes with headaches. In the end you have to do what is best for you.  EOS 0 0 36 Yeah. I guess boundaries are good.  EOS 0 0 37 I left her without much help to be honest but I guess just hearing it frustrates the crap out of me.  EOS 0 1 38 [Providing Suggestions] Or sell it now and pocket the money to recoup what was lost.  EOS 0 0 39 I would but it isn't even my property  EOS 0 0 40 And mom needs a place to stay... sometimes I wonder if she just wants to be homeless  EOS 0 1 41 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So she is just talking circles and not accomplishing what she says?  EOS 0 0 42 More like she keeps talking about doing something crazy like have a police chase  EOS 0 0 43 and how she doesn't care for anything  EOS 0 1 44 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Some people do choose that life to be free of responsibility.  EOS 0 1 45 [Providing Suggestions] Have you had a talk with her about seeing a mental health professional, She may be having some issues that would benefit from care.  EOS 0 0 46 I tried to baker act her after she tried to call the cops on me randomly  EOS 0 0 47 It ended up them asking dumb questions like if she knows what day it is  EOS 0 0 48 letting her free  EOS 0 0 49 somehow ending up with her getting herself hospitalized 2 weeks later for low hemoglobin.  EOS 0 1 50 [Information] Often police officers are not fully trained in helping mentally ill people, they only access if the person is a danger to themselves or others.  EOS 0 0 51 yeah it sucks  EOS 0 0 52 Tried to get her on disability but they just denied her  EOS 0 0 53 She was brought up with bipolar depression before I was born. She said she just ran out the hospital..  EOS 0 0 54 I don't know how she is just getting the consequences of that now  EOS 0 1 55 [Information] A good first step is taking her to your local mental health provider. Or ask at a major emergency room where this is located as sometimes the places are hard to find.  EOS 0 0 56 That was about 30 years ago  EOS 0 0 57 Crazy they didn't stop her  EOS 0 0 58 Well I do feel better. Thinking about boundaries. It has been less stressful being so involved.  EOS 0 1 59 [Others] Without treatment she may just be getting worse.

It is not your fault, and you aren't allowing this to happen to you. It is out of your control. Don't ever blame yourself.

EOS 3 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Think about work related, personal life, changes in behaviour?  EOS 3 0 12 yeah. may be work related  EOS 3 0 13 am spending more time on work  EOS 3 0 14 I need to switch some activities other than work  EOS 3 0 15 will you suggest to take off for few more days from work?  EOS 3 0 16 will that work  EOS 3 0 17 or any other better solution  EOS 3 1 18 [Others] It might solve as a temporary solution, however, if whatever happened at work to cause this continues when you return from holidays, you will just have the same problem again.  EOS 3 1 19 [Question] What exactly do you think is causing it? Additional work/responsibilities? New manager?  EOS 3 0 20 additional work being assigned to me  EOS 3 0 21 that causes more work stress  EOS 3 0 22 most of them are new to me, so am spending more time to learn  EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried to speak to your manager about these additional responsibilities?

EOS 3 0 27 to divert me from the extra addiotnal work  EOS 3 1 28 [Information] I don't think I can share links over here, however the activities you perform directly before you go to sleep have a direct impact on your sleeping.  EOS 3 1 29 [Providing Suggestions] I would recommend trying to practice 30m-1h of yoga (you can find lodes of exercise videos on the internet to follow), followed by a mediation sound track for you to listen to in bed while you try to sleep.

[situation]	Feelings of sadness, disappointment, or hopelessness can be a healthy reaction to life’s challenges. Normally, these feelings come in waves, are tied to thoughts or reminders of challenging situations, only last for a short period of time, and don’t interfere with school, work, or relationships.

A year. I haven't left my house once.  EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] so it sounds like you are feeling cooped up and not knowing what to do, am i right?  EOS 4 0 6 Yes, it's more than that.  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] can you tell me more?  EOS 4 0 8 I'm in this house, and scared. Nothing is getting better for me or anyone else I know.  EOS 4 1 9 [Question] may I ask where you are located?

[contxt]	0 1 7 [Question] Do you feel that there are other areas of your life that you are struggling with too?  EOS 0 0 8 I mean in school not doing great, and not super happy with my social life  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] Is there a specific problem with school or is it just 2020 fatigue?  EOS 0 0 10 Its hard to stay motivated, I don't really enjoy it, i mean I am sure a lot of people dont' but its very hard to focus and I'm worried I am in school for the wrong reasons, covid stuff def doesnt help tho  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I do not know how long you have to go in school but if you have not done very much so far would you consider dropping out and perhaps training for a profession instead?  EOS 0 1 12 [Information] Sometimes things can be more lucrative than just having a degree, if that makes sense  EOS 0 0 13 lol, not that easy, I dont know what profession I would train for... also I have been in college since late 2017 so I am at the final stretch and have already put a bunch of money in, I totally see where ur coming from though, however no trades really jump out to me and interest me. Maybe i can do research but again I am pretty far into college  EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well I would say that if you've got as far as you have you might as well get the piece of paper. But the world is your oyster after that - you do not need to be tied to your field!  EOS 0 0 15 I agree! I've always worried about money, Im hoping that it becomes a bit of a nonissue, not to get political but the whole capitalism thing is a huge downer lol, Imagine being able to live life without worrying about money, very nice, but then again financial freedom isnt everything.  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly I do not think there is any harm in the status quo being shaken up a little .. or indeed a lot!  EOS 0 0 17 forreal, our system is really weird, we place value on these random things and then force people to fight for pieces of paper their whole life, its an interesting problem  EOS 0 0 18 I find it more interesting how many people dont think about it too deeply, but they are probably happier that way  EOS 0 1 19 [Others] I totally agree. I am not totally sure what the solution is but I am hoping that there is one  EOS 0 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] Do you feel as though there is hope for the future though?  EOS 0 0 21 Oh definitely, its just scary comparing myself to others that look like they have it all figured out  EOS 0 1 22 [Self-disclosure] When I was a student I sometimes felt that everyone else knew where they were going except me. But I later found out that everyone has some insecurities.  EOS 0 1 23 [Self-disclosure] That said, I am still not totally sure where I am going a quarter of a century in so I am perhaps not the best person to take advice from :D

EOS 1 0 2 My friend's husband is spreading false rumors about me because my daughter moved up in soccer and theirs didn't. He's telling people it's because I'm having an affair with the coach - who is married! This is not true! My daughter is a better soccer player.  EOS 1 0 3 what do you think I should do?  EOS 1 1 4 [Information] It sounds like your friend's husband might be jealous of your daughter, or embarrassed that his daughter did not get moved up also. Have you spoken to your friend about this?  EOS 1 0 5 I haven't yet. I was deciding whether or not to talk to him directly or just her or both at the same time. I am really upset and don't want to lose her. I know people get all crazy about their kids and sports. I agree that he's jealous but his daughter isn't really that good - didn't make the school team either. Should I talk to my friend alone first?  EOS 1 1 6 [Self-disclosure] It depends on the depth of the relationship between the three of you. How long have you all been friends?  EOS 1 0 7 About 6 years. Our daughters are also friends, too. I am single so I don't care about the husband but also don't want to come in between their marriage.  EOS 1 1 8 [Information] Yes, that is a difficult situation to know how to handle. It could be in your best interest to leave your friend out of it so she doesn't feel stuck in the middle or forced to take sides. However she could view the opposite as you going behind her back.  EOS 1 0 9 yes that's true. I don't want to go behind her back but also don't want to get her involved. I could have the coach talk to the dad maybe?  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Yes, coaches are a great resource for life's dilemmas. Perhaps another option would be to casually mention something to him in passing, like at one your daughters games as to avoid any big blowups or emotional exlosions. 
[reference_response]	yes, coaches are a great resource for life's dilemmas. perhaps another option would be to casually mention something to him in passing, like at one your daughters games as to avoid any big blowups or emotional exlosions.
[hypothesis_response]	that'd be a great idea! i think it'd make a difference to have someone else in the relationship, and if she's not being supportive of your feelings, she'll just end up going behind your back. it would be a lot easier for you to do that if you were both together.

[contxt]	6 0 4 Yes, they aren't taking COVID seriously.  EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn't taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns?  EOS 6 0 6 Yes but they get angry with me. I don't know how to get through to them,  EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It's also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right.  EOS 6 0 8 I really don't know I just haven't been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out.  EOS 6 0 9 It's a weird dynamic.  EOS 6 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you're finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it's the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right?  EOS 6 0 11 That's exactly right.  EOS 6 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance.  EOS 6 0 13 I'd like to think so but I wish they would too. It's hard to know what is right.  EOS 6 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try?  EOS 6 0 15 Yes, but they'll have their BBQs and parties anyway. They are having a group Thanksgiving and there will be a lot of people there. My husband and I feel bad that we aren't going, but we also know it isn't smart.  EOS 6 1 16 [Information] I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can't live your life in fear, and that they're going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware.  EOS 6 0 17 We feel like after this is all over, they will still remind us that we were standoffish during this time.  EOS 6 0 18 And I agree. The longer we put it off and don't take it seriously, the longer it will last.  EOS 6 1 19 [Others] Can you tell them that that just isn't the case? You and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others. If I am correct, it has nothing to do with the fact that you don't want to see your pals and family!  EOS 6 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] From chatting with you it sounds like your relationships with these people is incredibly important to you.  EOS 6 0 21 Yes that's totally accurate.  EOS 6 0 22 Yes they are. They are good people.  EOS 6 0 23 They just think living for the moment is the bigger picture.  EOS 6 1 24 [Others] I hope your friends can see how important they are to you and thats a huge reason why you're not seeing them.  EOS 6 0 25 I think they do. They just think that this is a hoax.  EOS 6 1 26 [Self-disclosure] I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting COVID. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn't think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking.

[contxt]	4 0 10 i don't know yet tbh.  EOS 4 0 11 i have never been cheated on before.  EOS 4 0 12 we also live together so it's complicated  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand your frustration. It happened to me before. And I've had girlfriends. They never change. They will apologize because they got caught, but they never really change.  EOS 4 0 14 But, how do I know for sure if he did cheat?  EOS 4 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's going to be very painful for a while because you have been invested 3 years in this relationship. Do you have friends to talk to that can encourage and support you?  EOS 4 0 16 The messages were about meeting up for a photoshoot at the brooklyn bridge.  EOS 4 0 17 is that cheating because he lied  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I find if they flirt, they already have cheated. Loyalty is something inside a person, or not. Very few will look inside themselves and see why they do this and want to change. If you were married, you would need counseling.  EOS 4 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] Do you meet up with your exes?  EOS 4 0 20 i'm still friends with many of my exes, but he knows that and we all hang out together  EOS 4 0 21 thats why it's weird that he lied  EOS 4 1 22 [Others] He lied because he didn't want you to know the truth. Which is betrayal.  EOS 4 0 23 also, when he gets home, how do i tell him how i found out.  EOS 4 0 24 i mean, i literally got into his facebook without asking  EOS 4 0 25 i just had this intuition that he was being suspicious  EOS 4 1 26 [Others] It's a hot mess, is it not? Why did you feel you wanted to spy on him? Did you already mistrust him?  EOS 4 0 27 well, it was weird that he got so dressed up to go hang out with friends  EOS 4 0 28 it makes sense now that i know he went for a photoshoot  EOS 4 1 29 [Self-disclosure] Ok, so this is a HUGE red flag to you. You can ignore it, or not. Women KNOW when a man is cheating, so you had that inside of you. And you went with your hunch and now you have found he is dishonest.  EOS 4 1 30 [Question] Was the photoshoot to have pictures of him?  EOS 4 0 31 yeah, she's a photographer  EOS 4 0 32 she took all his headshots when he first moved to America, actually  EOS 4 0 33 when they were together  EOS 4 1 34 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I suppose it could be Christmas pictures of him for you? Or not. I personally feel honesty is the best policy, no matter what. I would come clean. I would tell him I sensed trouble and looked for it and found it.  EOS 4 0 35 i worry that i am jumping to conclusions.  EOS 4 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You could be, but then you wouldn't have a feeling of mistrust, you would just be sensing a surprise.  EOS 4 0 37 he may say: you are friends with ur exes, why can't i be friends with mine?  EOS 4 0 38 he never said which friends he was going to see  EOS 4 0 39 he also didnt offer to take me with him, though  EOS 4 0 40 i always invite him when i hang out with my exes  EOS 4 1 41 [Question] He could say that. And if he is lying, do you think he will begin to be honest? You will have to judge for yourself. If he is lying, he will continue to lie. And you will feel it inside of yourself. Is this the first time you felt this way? Or has this happened before?  EOS 4 0 42 never before.  EOS 4 0 43 i guess ur right  EOS 4 1 44 [Self-disclosure] I'm an older woman, almost 60. I've been married 20 years but I had a lot of boyfriends and I can tell you one thing, If they start to look elsewhere, run for the hills, they will continue to excuse their behavior, apologize, say they will change, and it just gets worse. I drove myself insane with worry, suspicion. I wanted someone to treasure me, not cheat and lie. Cheaters don't change their spots.

[hypothesis_response]	well, you will need to be able to see the situation from his side. if you have to see it from his end, you have got to be open to the fact that he did it. and then you will be able judge for the reasons he had.

[contxt]	4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you for sharing and reaching out for support today. It takes a lot of courage and I commend you for taking the steps to reach out.  EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] !0 years is a very long time and I would think you have probably learned a lot working at the same place for that long. You're a dedicated employee.  EOS 4 0 9 I was okay with the previous manager. But recently a new young chap joined the duty. He was not experienced .He only is the reason for so.  EOS 4 1 10 [Others] That is really unfair and hard to deal with are you close to any famliy?  EOS 4 0 11 I am not in any close to any family related to job.  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have any close friends to talk to about any new job prospects?  EOS 4 0 13 I have few friends, I have been talking to them. They also tell I was not any wrong . For the experience and qualification, I will be getting a better job.  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That is a positive outlook and is good to hear that you know you have skills to offer. Would you consider joining a new group at a church or something like that?  EOS 4 0 15 I am so worried of the management taken action on me relying a new unexperienced manager.  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] I am sorry that you're feeling stress. Have you ever used writing as a tool to relax?  EOS 4 0 17 My colleagues are also in contact with me. They are also having similar inconvenience as to how to perform?  EOS 4 0 18 I have some other relaxation like listening to music, gardening etc.,  EOS 4 1 19 [Information] Oh, wow then you do have a lot of contacts and some support or at least understanding. Music is a great way to relax and that id very positive in your life and current situation.  EOS 4 0 20 I am so confident I will be having a better job within the next few months.  EOS 4 1 21 [Information] That is a great outlook. Thank you for sharing today.  EOS 4 0 22 Meantime I try to learn new things to improve myself personally and professionally.  EOS 4 1 23 [Information] Thank you for reaching out today amd letting me listen.  EOS 4 0 24 Do you have any suggestion for me? I always believe the third angle.  EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] I would suggest getting a pet if you are up for it. They can be support animals.  EOS 4 0 26 That is a good idea. But I dont like being close to any animal and letting them inside the house.  EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions] I can understand that feeling. I think maybe fish would be a distraction you may like to.  EOS 4 0 28 I think motivation, self-development, getting more qualified is of my attention nowadays.  EOS 4 1 29 [Information] I understand and believe you have a great focus on a career. I am proud of you and your focus ability.  EOS 4 0 30 Fish tank is a better option. I forgot that. That is why I am more believing in the third angle. Thank you.  EOS 4 1 31 [Information] You're welcome I can be available to listen or bounce ideas of off as much as you need.  EOS 4 0 32 Talking to you I feel more relaxed and confident of me.  EOS 4 1 33 [Information] That is the goal and what we strive for. You are welcome.  EOS 4 0 34 Okay. Thank you. Can I take a leave.

EOS 3 0 6 My girlfriend and I recently broke up so it has got me a little down  EOS 3 0 7 I'm glad that you're having a good weekend so far  EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Sorry to hear that. Breakups are rough I can say as I've been through a couple myself.  EOS 3 1 9 [Question] How long were you two together?  EOS 3 0 10 We were together for two years. It's been a pretty tough week but I've been trying to go on walks with my dog & whatnot to keep my mind off thigns  EOS 3 0 11 things*  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Fur babies are definitely good in bad times. It's good that you're taking the time out for yourself. That takes strength!  EOS 3 0 13 That's one of the things that I am trying to focus on - being mindful of myself.  EOS 3 0 14 It's been helpful that my city is on Lockdown so I'm able to go on walks & spend some time by myself  EOS 3 1 15 [Question] Oh that's awesome - despite the circumstances. Are you in the US?  EOS 3 0 16 No, thank heavens. My government is handling things a bit better here in Canada.  EOS 3 0 17 Being out of work is tough, but at the same time I get a bunch of time to myself.  EOS 3 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm jealous. hehe I often wonder what our friends to the north are going through. I'm glad to see you reaching out too. That's awesome!  EOS 3 0 19 It feels good to reach out and at least talk to someone about something to be honest.  EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know the feeling and especially in these times. It seems things are looking up though with a vaccine coming soon. Getting outside and reaching out is definitely the right thing to do. Soon things will be back to normal!  EOS 3 0 21 That's what I'm hoping for... It looks like there is finally light at the end of the tunnel.

I know feeling sad is natural...so I try and not let it get the best of me. I just try and stay busy doing things I enjoy, reading and journaling. I am also thinking of planning a trip to visit my sons next year if COVID is no longer an issue  EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you understand what you are going through. Keeping busy and planning for the future better times are great ways to help overcome some of your sadness.  EOS 4 0 9 Yes. I agree. I keep trying to get my daughter to fly overseas with me, but she hates to fly. I totally understand that. I don't really like it either. Her tumor seems to be shrinking, which is a very good thing.

EOS 1 0 4 My ex partner and I broke up a long time ago because they cheated on me. Now they will not stop contacting my friends and family and posting about me on social media  EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That sounds difficult and stressful. What do you do when you see it happening?  EOS 1 0 6 I usually just document it and try to not go online for a while. It is hard to ignore  EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are avoiding things you enjoy because of their actions. I think documenting it is a good idea! Have you tried reporting them for harassing you?  EOS 1 0 8 I have tried but everyone just tells me there is nothing they can do because they don't think it is dangerous or criminal at this point  EOS 1 1 9 [Question] That must be very frustrating. Can you tell me if you’ve tried other things to get them to stop?  EOS 1 0 10 I have confronted them in person but it was dramatic to say the least. They basically had a meltdown that they don't want to lose me  EOS 1 1 11 [Self-disclosure] You tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions?

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hello  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you?  EOS 0 0 2 At the moment, good.  EOS 0 0 3 I need help!  EOS 0 0 4 These people.....I don't understand....  EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear that they don't understand, can you explain further  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Can you tell me more?  EOS 0 0 7 My co-workers feel that this whole pandemic thing is a government conspiracy to lessen the overpopulation in this world. It really hurts me cause I have people who have passed due to this. THIS IS REAL!!  EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There are a lot of people who are struggling and it is clearly a very upsetting time for you.  EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Have you considered whether your colleagues are simply hiding their worry? Have you tried talking to them?  EOS 0 0 10 Yet it is upsetting and I worry for them.  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is extremely compassionate of you.  EOS 0 0 12 I tried talking to them. I tried to reason with them. They feel that life is life. No it is not. Now I respect their positions in life, but since we work together, we have to protect other feelings as well.  EOS 0 1 13 [Question] There is a lot of concern about, are your work following guidelines?  EOS 0 0 14 I am very anxious cause I need to run to the bathroom and breath  EOS 0 0 15 Work guidelines we are following. I want the anxiety to stop.  EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I am also in this situation at work, I have used breathing methods to calm myself down which worked, have you tried anything like this?  EOS 0 0 17 It is simple, put on mask and work, when you get out of the office then do what you want.  EOS 0 0 18 I am anxious now and using a breathing exercise as I type  EOS 0 1 19 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are frustrated because others are not using masks, have I got that right?  EOS 0 0 20 It's not that they are not using masks, it is their position and reasons not to wear the masks and that puts others in a scary and anxious position at their workplace where in these times, work is scare.  EOS 0 0 21 What is your point of view on masks?  EOS 0 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] Just from talking to you, I can feel how anxious you are and this is made worse by your colleagues, perhaps they are struggling in different ways with this.  EOS 0 0 23 Yes they are....we need to make things different for everyone in the workplace but not on peoples health  EOS 0 1 24 [Information] There are guidelines on how work places should be handling the COVID issue. Has your manager gone through any guidelines with the team?  EOS 0 0 25 Yes he has and is going to go over it on Monday with all of us and we should come to an agreement  EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] That seems like a really good time to go through how you feel. Writing how you feel down can help to ensure that you get your feelings across. Do you think that is something you could do?  EOS 0 0 27 Yes, this is something I can do. You have been a great help listening to my issues.  EOS 0 1 28 [Others] I am glad this is something that can work for you, it is something that could help in different ways.

EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Can you tell me a little more?  EOS 0 0 5 I wish I could find a job, I have been applying everywhere. I makes me very sad that no one will hire me.  EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] That is definitely understandable. When I first graduated from college, I went through the same thing and thought I would never find a job!  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] What field do you work in?  EOS 0 0 8 This had been such a hard year with covid. I am a pet sitter, but people aren't leaving home so I have no work.  EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Just from this short conversation, I can tell how upset you are. It's definitely hard this year since people aren't traveling.  EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Have you tried any other jobs?  EOS 0 0 11 I have tried every field I might qualify for. People want experience, which I don't have.  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are supplementing income right here with Mturk! That was a great choice!  EOS 0 1 13 [Information] And the vaccine is starting to slowly roll out, I think many more people will feel more comfortable traveling soon,  EOS 0 0 14 Yes, indeed. But I haven't been able to pay rent for 3 months, that is scary.  EOS 0 0 15 I hope so  EOS 0 1 16 [Question] I understand why that is very scary! Do you live alone? Or is there another person bringing in income?  EOS 0 0 17 Just me and my daughter.  EOS 0 1 18 [Information] Many landlords understand the struggle and are allowing tenants extra time when they can't pay. Is that the case for you?  EOS 0 0 19 I don't know, they seem understanding but who knows how much longer? I just hate this unknown.  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] It sounds like the stress of the unknown is really getting to you. I have definitely felt this way over the past year too, You aren't alone. When I start to fell stressed, I take a few deep breaths and focus on what I can control.  EOS 0 0 21 Yes, I keep pushing on. Thank you for your understanding.  EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] In your case, you can control how many applications you fill out. And it sounds like you are filling out many. I believe if you keep doing that, you will find a job.

Now I am in situation, previously he was when I helped. I expected my friend surely will help. But he did not. This has put me some anger on him. This was a situation that happened 1 year before. Now I recall this for chatting.  EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Well, are you sure that he could have definitely afforded to loan you anything?  EOS 1 0 6 Yes. That was well within his limits and he should have obliged.  EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Well, the thing is, just because you had lent to him does not mean he is obliged to help you  EOS 1 1 8 [Others] Though of course it would have been the courteous thing to do  EOS 1 0 9 Thank you for your understanding and feeling.

I don't feel like I could ever be happy again  EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Whenever I am feeling upset about the situation I look at all the good things I have going for me, like my job, and my family, and my health.  EOS 4 0 11 I lost my job a few months ago. I do have kids though.  EOS 4 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] From what we have talked about so far, I can see how losing your job would also make you much more anxious.  EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] I would definitely focus on making sure to spend time with your kids though! They are extremely important and they need you to be as much yourself as you can!

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hi. I am worried about my exams.  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Exams are a stressful time. What seems to be the problem?  EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Exams are a stressful time. What seems to be the problem?  EOS 0 0 3 I do not feel like I am properly prepared, even though I have studied.  EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can assure you that countless students including myself have gone through the trials of studying for exams and do feel overwhelmed but it passes.  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you studied?  EOS 0 0 6 I have studied. However, I still feel like I am not prepared. One big problem is that I have no quiet place to study.  EOS 0 1 7 [Information] I get it, distractions can be challenging to overcome at times. Have you thought about going to a library, or a book store?  EOS 0 0 8 I have not. Both of those are great suggestions. I wonder if I should take the time to walk to the library (30 minutes), or just continue to study? Maybe, I know as much as I can know. The anxiety is too much.  EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If it helps you study then the library may be worth the time and effort. Sometimes we can stress out over worrying about not having enough time to study. But trust the work you have done and you will know if it is enough.  EOS 0 0 10 This is very good advice. Have you completed college?  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] Yes, and it wasn't easy but with hard work, it is completely doable. And you have the power within yourself.  EOS 0 0 12 What do you think will happen if I fail this test?  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes it is not about the amount of studying, but the way you study. I like reading my textbooks and highlighting the important parts and then rewriting them so they become ingrained in me. But let us not jump the gun, you haven't failed anything.  EOS 0 0 14 Very true. Thanks for reminding me. I think I worry more about the outcome than I need too.  EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Don't forget to breathe. Exams are stressful but I would suggest don't cram everything to the last minute. Usually the hour before the exam, I do something else.  EOS 0 0 16 Very good advice. Any suggestions on what I can do?  EOS 0 1 17 [Information] Stay calm, believe in yourself, start your studying early so you are not cramming everything in the last few days.  EOS 0 0 18 Great Advice.  EOS 0 0 19 But, in the one hour prior to the exam, do you have any advice on something I can do to calm my nerves?  EOS 0 1 20 [Information] Walk outside, away from the students waiting for their tests.  EOS 0 0 21 Wonderful suggestion  EOS 0 0 22 Thank you for your help. I think I will go walk now. Best regards.  EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Is there anything else I can help you with?  EOS 0 0 24 No. Thank you.  EOS 0 1 25 [Others] Goodnight and good luck.

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hello, I have been feeling very anxious and stressed recently.  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Why have you been feeling stressed and anxious?  EOS 0 0 2 I failed my first exam earlier this week and I have 2 more later on in this week. I am already disheartened about my first failure and I am scared that I will fail again.  EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure you tried your best on that test, as long as you study hard I believe you can ace those next 2 exams!  EOS 0 0 4 I have been too stressed about my other exams, it's making it hard for me to focus on studying and I don't know what to do.  EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] I've heard that meditation can help with stress and focus, maybe you could try meditating for a bit before you study?  EOS 0 0 6 I have never tried meditating before, I have no idea where to start.  EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Meditation is essentially focussing on breathing, you could start by closing your eyes and slowly breathe in an out.  EOS 0 0 8 I feel like a failure and I am scared my parents are going to be disappointed in me  EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] From what you're saying to me, I feel that you don't believe in yourself very much.  EOS 0 0 10 I guess you are right, I need to believe in myself and my abilities more.  EOS 0 0 11 I just don't know how sometimes.  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I've struggled with the same thing before, whenever I doubt myself I look back at all i've accomplished and look at myself in the mirror and tell myself that I can do it. It has worked well for me.  EOS 0 0 13 What if I fail another exam this week? I need at least an 80% to pass my class, I am so worried.  EOS 0 1 14 [Information] Psychologies studies show that spacing out your studying and relearning helps you remember more information, you could try to section off your studying and then reviewing information before the exam!  EOS 0 0 15 That seems like a good plan, hopefully I will be able to get the score I need to pass.  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure you'll do your best and pass that exam with flying colors!

[contxt]	5 0 0 Yo  EOS 5 1 1 [Question] Hi, how are you doing?  EOS 5 0 2 I am decent. I am here because my friend talks way too much on the phone, and it frustrates me.  EOS 5 0 3 They never want to hang up, and the talk can literally go on for hours.  EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like it would be quite frustrating for your friend to talk way too much on the phone.  EOS 5 0 5 No, he loves it! I'm the one who hates it.  EOS 5 1 6 [Question] My goodness! How do they respond when you ask to end the conversation?  EOS 5 0 7 I tell him, but he just doesn't get it. Or, he says he understands, but then just goes back to talking!  EOS 5 0 8 Or, he may finally end the talk, but the next time we talk, he will just do it all over again!  EOS 5 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] I wonder what it would be like for him if you hung up the phone even after he said he still wanted to talk.  EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Wow--that does sound annoying that he will repeat the same pattern the next time.  EOS 5 0 11 He will literally talk up to 10 minutes without letting you have a word in. As far as that advice, I have hung up, but he gets extremely offended easily.  EOS 5 1 12 [Self-disclosure] That sounds really difficult if he gets offended so easily. I find it hard to talk to some of those kinds of friends.  EOS 5 0 13 I'm at my wits end. I tell him all the time. "You talk too much. You gotta stop talking at me. You gotta give the other person a turn. You gotta respect other's time."  EOS 5 1 14 [Question] What do you get out of the friendship with this other person?  EOS 5 0 15 Well, I've been friends with him for a long time. He's funny and can have interesting perspectives on things. Also, we have done a lot together in the past.  EOS 5 1 16 [Question] That sounds like a lot that the two of you have been through. Were there other times that your friends was more equally responsive or attuned to you in conversations?  EOS 5 0 17 Oh, yes, I have other friends in conversations who can take turns and understand the concept of time just fine.  EOS 5 0 18 I just don't know what to do about this guy in particular. I still want to be his friend, but he just doesn't change.  EOS 5 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I wonder if there is anything nice you could do for yourself when you are talking to him that would make it easier to talk to him.  EOS 5 0 20 Do you think I should just have a timer that goes off at 1 minute and let it beep in his face if he goes on for too long to train him like a monkey?  EOS 5 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see that you are feeling upset and angry when he talks so much and that is totally understandable.

I feel helpless.  EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Is there a reason she wants to leave?  EOS 2 0 5 She says I'm too critical and I complain too much. Meanwhile, she's the miserable one.  EOS 2 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe you could help her feel more comfortable around you, as that is what I would do :)  EOS 2 0 7 She's had both vaccines and watches CNN 20 hours a day...meanwhile I watch positive videos, do yoga, meditate and work all day. She's projecting.  EOS 2 0 8 I'm trying. I'm not saying anything negative even though that's just my NY personality. She doesn't have a sense of humor though.  EOS 2 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It seems like you two don't share a lot of chemistry. But then again, you can't afford to let her leave  EOS 2 0 10 I think she just wants to live alone here and wallow in her misery and embarrassing TV choices. lol But yes, you're right, I'm just trying to make her comfortable. And yes, we have nothing in common.  EOS 2 0 11 I may buy a car to live in. But I'm in AZ and it's about to be 110 degrees every day...  EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] No i don't think thats a good idea, if you are still able to change her mind  EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe try to talk it out with her in a calm setting  EOS 2 0 14 She screamed at me one day about 2 weeks ago, but hasn't mentioned it since. But, I do know she still wants me to go...the problem is if I bring it up, she gets really angry. It's like I can't win.  EOS 2 0 15 I think she thinks when I try to talk about it, it means I want to leave and since there's nothing either of us can do about it, she hates me even more...because it implies I can't stand her. If that makes any sense.  EOS 2 0 16 She's extremely non-confrontational. (except for that one day where she just let it all out--hates my personality apparently)  EOS 2 1 17 [Others] Yeah, if she is non-confrontational that means that you will have to initiate it  EOS 2 1 18 [Information] Because she won't and she will end up leaving  EOS 2 0 19 But I don't want to make her mad again. Sometimes she just forgets things. lol Maybe she'll forget that she wants me to leave.  EOS 2 0 20 The funny thing is, she just bought a trailer....and I offered to live in it. She didn't go for that idea.  EOS 2 1 21 [Question] yeah but you can't really take such a gamble tbh. And why did she buy it, is it because she wanted you to live in it?  EOS 2 0 22 She bought it as a horse trailer. So she can both live in it when she goes on the rode and carry her horses too. But she hasn't even used it since she bought it months ago. Do you know how long we're supposed to chat for btw?  EOS 2 0 23 road*, not rode. lol sorry  EOS 2 0 24 Ah, 15 minutes...I see it says on the left.

EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I'm particularly worried about my parents. One is on oxygen at night, but he still doesn't want to listen about not going in crowds.  EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Oh well I understand your concern then. As a son or daughter it is certainly reasonable to be concerned about your parents especially as they grow older. I have a similar situation with my own mother.  EOS 0 0 5 I just don't know what more to do.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Well first of all, you have to take care of yourself because if you don't you can't help them. So just take a moment to close your eyes and take some deep breaths and realize you stressing is probably going to make them stress.  EOS 0 0 7 That is helpful information. What can I tell them?

EOS 4 0 25 I used to live up north but the cold got to me  EOS 4 1 26 [Reflection of feelings] It's definitely not for everyone. Amazing how temperature can mess with your mood as well. Something about sun and sand can really put you in a good mood.

EOS 6 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you were thrown out from a place you were renting? Did you do anything wrong?  EOS 6 0 7 No. The renter said he just wanted me out. He also charged me ninety extra dollars.  EOS 6 1 8 [Information] Wow that is illegal. Do you know that there are organisations that can help you with this sort of thing?  EOS 6 0 9 No. I did not.

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hi..Iam in severe kind of depression and stress.  EOS 4 0 1 Iam married for 7 years and have 2 kids..My partner never liked me and he only used me as a sexual toy .he is abusing me physically and sexually .  EOS 4 0 2 I feel like there is some one to share my pain and very badly need a shoulder to cry on.  EOS 4 0 3 I want to really go for some therapy to get out of sadness in my life.  EOS 4 0 4 i want to be there for my kids who are really a blessing from god.  EOS 4 0 5 I love to go back to my parents but they even dont look after me.  EOS 4 0 6 They worry about the society more than their own daughter.  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Hello, I just connected. What do you want to talk about most?  EOS 4 0 8 I am seeking some emotional help with my depression  EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] We can start over... It seems like you have having issues with managing depression. Is that so?  EOS 4 0 10 Iam a victim of domestic and sexual abuse by my partner.yes,I need some help  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is OK to ask for help. Many people do it every day. You deserve to be heard.  EOS 4 0 12 Yeah I have two beautiful kids,I just want to be there for them in their life.  EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] You have a wonderful dedication to your children, I can tell.  EOS 4 0 14 Yeah also I am looking for some financial security for my kids future which is possible only with a job..  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] You mentioned this before, but have you tried therapy sessions?  EOS 4 0 16 Yeah Iam looking to go for therapy ,but not able to find a therapist according to my budget.  EOS 4 1 17 [Information] There are many ways to find a mental health professional at little to no cost. Look in your network and see if you can find someone without a co-pay, or if you don't have insurance, you will be able to find people who provide services who use sliding pay scales.  EOS 4 0 18 Those are very helpful ideas..Thank you very much.I will try for sure.  EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] You are welcome. Sometimes you will pay as little as 0-$20 a session. I've found this to be helpful in my life on multiple occasions.  EOS 4 0 20 Oh I didnt know that the therapy sessions are that inexpensive.I was in a opinion like they cost me 200 $for each session.  EOS 4 0 21 Any opinions that I can consider?  EOS 4 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] You have to find what is available. Avoid big buildings full of psychologists, usually the more independent practices are reasonable and provide better service IMO.  EOS 4 0 23 What kind of therapies are useful and beneficial to me in my situation.  EOS 4 1 24 [Information] Probably someone to talk to, so just a counselor or therapist fits the bill. I am not a doctor so don't take anything I say as medical advice btw.  EOS 4 0 25 Sure..That is very helpful..Can you suggest where to find some online forums to find survivors with my same condition.  EOS 4 1 26 [Information] I found a lot of chat boards and information from a google search. You are not alone and it is OK to feel and to be going through this. 
[reference_response]	i found a lot of chat boards and information from a google search. you are not alone and it is ok to feel and to be going through this.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hi thanks for chatting with me today. I've been really down and could use someone to talk to.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Of course! What have been down about?  EOS 3 0 3 I always get sad around the holidays but this year has been so much worse because I'm spending the holidays alone.  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I'm sorry to hear that. I know being alone in the holidays can be rough.  EOS 3 0 5 All I have to do is think about how alone I am.  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have any friends or people you can set up an online zoom call with?  EOS 3 0 7 I tried that but no one that I know is tech savvy that can make Zoom work.  EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Also I feel that as well. Especially now these days its a bit hard to not think about being alone.  EOS 3 0 9 I just keep thinking about all the bad things happening in the world right now. If I had someone to spend time with I'm sure it would take my mind off of it but people aren't allowed to get together.  EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Oh how about just texting or having periodic phone calls with friends?  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah the pandemic has really stopped interactions. But that doesn't mean you can't stop talking to people completely!  EOS 3 0 12 I try that but everyone is busy with their families today. I don't have a family so I'm all alone.  EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Oh I see I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you tried doing other activities to make your mind off it?  EOS 3 0 14 I tried watching a movie but my mind starts to wander.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] For me personally doing online gaming is a great way to interact with others and have fun.  EOS 3 0 16 Maybe I'll try that. Any game suggestions?  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] What type of movie were you trying to watch? Maybe choose a happier movie than a sad one. 
[reference_response]	what type of movie were you trying to watch? maybe choose a happier movie than a sad one.

EOS 3 0 6 going through a depression due to a job loss  EOS 3 1 7 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus  EOS 3 0 8 No. I was hurt at work  EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus  EOS 3 0 10 yep  EOS 3 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman's comp  EOS 3 0 12 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there  EOS 3 0 14 which?  EOS 3 1 15 [Question] How bad were you injured  EOS 3 0 16 i have permanent spinal injuries  EOS 3 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit  EOS 3 0 18 hopefully vaccine is avail soon  EOS 3 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer  EOS 3 0 20 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn't injured  EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability  EOS 3 0 22 i applied for disability but didn't get it  EOS 3 1 23 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself  EOS 3 0 24 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn't matter  EOS 3 1 25 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why?  EOS 3 0 26 i'm not injured enough for them  EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer. .  EOS 3 1 28 [Question] Were there proper safety guards  EOS 3 0 29 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity  EOS 3 0 30 no  EOS 3 1 31 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect.  EOS 3 0 32 I was told that I assumed the risk of injury working for them. It was a mental hospital  EOS 3 1 33 [Question] have you contacted OSHA and filed a complaint with them?  EOS 3 0 34 not yet. I should  EOS 3 1 35 [Providing Suggestions] There should be an avenue for you to seek compensation.  EOS 3 0 36 The lawyer fought with them for over a year. There was even an appeal but I lost that too.  EOS 3 1 37 [Reflection of feelings] It is unfortunate that safety is not a factor.  EOS 3 1 38 [Others] It was a state hospital?  EOS 3 0 39 yes  EOS 3 1 40 [Question] Did a patient attack you?  EOS 3 0 41 yes  EOS 3 1 42 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There must be liability concerning your injury.  EOS 3 0 43 I can't go after the patient because they are mentally incompetent so I'm out of ideas.  EOS 3 1 44 [Question] But what about the family?  EOS 3 0 45 I don't know if the person had one anymore.  EOS 3 1 46 [Question] Is the patient a ward of the state  EOS 3 0 47 yes  EOS 3 1 48 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So the patient's family either gave the person up or the patient was placed there by the state right?  EOS 3 0 49 he was placed there by the court after committing a crime  EOS 3 1 50 [Affirmation and Reassurance] . Then he must be a threat to other people. It seems the state should be held liable for negligence.  EOS 3 0 51 Oh I agree. There were many dangerous patients there and no recourse for the staff. I was injured 5 times in the years I worked there. This last one was the end for me. I couldn't work anymore due to pain.  EOS 3 1 52 [Question] Can you work from home for yourself?  EOS 3 0 53 I have been applying for those kind of jobs but haven't had any luck yet.  EOS 3 1 54 [Information] There are companies hiring. 
[reference_response]	there are companies hiring.

EOS 3 0 3 I think I was feeling overwhelmed by his political views and with the election and everything it became much more obvious that we weren't right for each other. But Im nervous with the holidays coming up that I will be sad to be alone  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel you, it's scary to not be with the person you love so suddenly, especially during holiday  EOS 3 0 5 It is!! we were together for 5 years, so this is uncharted territory for me  EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] However, from what you told me, it's no longer fit for you two to be together as your views are opposite. Maybe this is for the better  EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] You can plan to spend the holiday with your friends or family instead. We are usually busy and neglect the most important people. This is the time to take care of that  EOS 3 0 8 That is true, and that was why I broke it off. He supported Trump, which I knew 4 years ago during the election, but this year it was overwhelming.  EOS 3 0 9 I will be with family thankfully, we have a small family so COVID isn't something I have to worry about.  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. You made the right decision, if not now you will get in even more arguments in the future. He is just not the right person  EOS 3 0 11 Overall, I know im going to be ok, but it feels so fresh and like it hurts still.  EOS 3 1 12 [Others] Spend the time now that you have on yourself too. Be an even better version of you  EOS 3 0 13 Thank you for vaildating my decision.  EOS 3 0 14 Yes, that is my plan. Focus on me and finding out what it is that I truly want in life.  EOS 3 0 15 He's helped me understand what I don't want.  EOS 3 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] That's the right attitude. With the right person, you learn what you like. With the wrong person, you learn what to avoid  EOS 3 0 17 Have you ever gone through something like this?  EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] No I have not, but I have someone ghosted on my before. It hurt and actually helps me realize who cares and serious about me  EOS 3 0 19 That can be just as hurtful! I heard something helpful once that if someone is into you youll know it and if you dont know it, then you dont want to be with them anyways.  EOS 3 0 20 Or that you shouldn't be with them  EOS 3 1 21 [Others] Yeah, it took me quite a long time to break it off, and I'm glad I did. I'm glad you decided to call it off with your ex too, it's not an easy decision

EOS 3 1 4 [Information] Problems often arise in relationships over misunderstanding each others point of view.  EOS 3 0 5 yeah i accept it there will be misunderstanding we want to get adjust  EOS 3 0 6 but it must be both side adjusted ,if not it will result in breakup only.

EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I totally understand how you feel  EOS 3 0 5 Yeah, it's pretty tough because the year went really well until the summer. I was hoping for a strong close.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] If you don't mind may I ask you a few question? Are you trying to find gigs?  EOS 3 0 7 Yes but with the pandemic, people are just doing small work themselves instead of hiring out.  EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sorry. I guess you have to change your plan so much.

EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I meant you had to change your plan  EOS 3 0 11 Yes, and the changes I've made to the plan haven't lead to a whole lot more.

EOS 3 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Jobs are super competitive these days. Have you thought about becoming a YouTuber or a live streamer?  EOS 3 0 18 Yes, I've tried both of those. It's mostly luck based. You just have to hope that enough people get interested to make it work and a lot of wasted effort goes into self- promotion.  EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I believe after Covid is over more onsite jobs will be available. I hope you will be able to comfortably spend your days until then.  EOS 3 0 20 I agree with that. I just hope  EOS 3 0 21 * I can make it until then  EOS 3 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I see. I see you have made a lot of effort to get additional income.

EOS 3 1 24 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would brush up my resume, make it more noticeable, change your LinkedIn profile if you have one. So that future employer will be able to find you, such a great candidate.  EOS 3 0 25 Hmmm, my resume could use some work, that is true.  EOS 3 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] About resume, one of my friends added his picture wearing a Trump tie on his resume lol . I thought it was weird but whatever it makes it noticeable could help.  EOS 3 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Or you could start your own business as you have already tried as a YouTuber. I heard a lot of people starts their own because of Covid  EOS 3 0 28 I never thought about adding a picture to my resume, but it would help show that I'm a profes sional.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Good evening. I am so ready for bed. Is it bedtime yet  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Depending on where you are, it might be. May i ask why you are so tired?  EOS 3 0 3 I m in pa its 417pm and all I ever want to do is sleep  EOS 3 0 4 anyone there  EOS 3 1 5 [Information] Hello i am sorry for the delay  EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is there anything going on to make you so tired?  EOS 3 0 7 No just tired all the time . Doesn't matter how much sleep I get  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Have you gone to a doctor yet and asked for more information about this?  EOS 3 0 9 I have been diagnosed with major clinical depression over 20years ago  EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh i am sorry to hear that, are you doing anything now as treatment?  EOS 3 0 11 I am under no treatment. I had over 20 medicines over the year and nothing helped .  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried just talking to a therapist?  EOS 3 0 13 years ago but nothing  EOS 3 0 14 now because my husband doesn't allow it or think it will help  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes it can be as simple as not connecting with the right therapist. They are there to support you and if you dont feel the connection its ok to move on to another. Maybe its time to look again?  EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, your husband does not control you. You are in control of yourself. It is not his mind and body its set to help. Its yours.  EOS 3 0 17 true but he s got me under his control long story  EOS 3 1 18 [Information] I think that might be an issue you need to deal with first. That is not an ok situation to be in.

EOS 2 0 3 Yes I'm not even sure what steps to take right now.  EOS 2 1 4 [Providing Suggestions] Yea that can be difficult. Have you started looking for something else?  EOS 2 0 5 Not yet, I'm not even sure where to begin. I have not looked for a job in 20 years.  EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way  EOS 2 0 7 I've tried calling the unemployment office to get some ideas but they do not answer their phones.  EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Or you could look for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things until you find something more permanent.  EOS 2 0 9 Yeah, i'm kinda old for that - LOL!!! My back would not hold up to that - and my salary wouldn't be comparable.  EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea it seems to be hard to get up with a lot of places at this time. Persistent is the key.  EOS 2 0 11 Well I hear that their offices are closed and you have to do everything online - so not sure if they can even help me.  EOS 2 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes i understand right now is a very bad time to find anything with so many places closed.  EOS 2 1 13 [Question] Do you have any family or friends to reach out to for help if needed?  EOS 2 0 14 I think I might be able to call my friend, but she's in another state  EOS 2 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Have you gave any thought to babysitting or are there any crafts you are good at making that maybe you could try to sell?  EOS 2 0 16 That would not be enough money. I would not be able to pay my bills.  EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand your concern there but it could help pay some as to help you not to get to far behind until you find something.  EOS 2 0 18 that's true but i don't want to lose my house either  EOS 2 1 19 [Self-disclosure] If i were you i would call your friend maybe she has some suggestions of things you could do based off of your skills.

[contxt]	3 0 3 Only very recently. I answered his phone and it was her! When I confronted him he admitted it.  EOS 3 1 4 [Question] that's a hard way to find out. are you still in the same house?  EOS 3 0 5 Yes because for financial reasons we have to be. Our relationship is really strained though and we are sleeping in separate bedrooms.  EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] i can't imagine what you are going through, but separate spaces sounds like a very good idea to me.  EOS 3 0 7 It is made worse by the fact that we are in lockdown and so can't really see other people at the moment. Do you think I should try and break away for good?  EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] before you take any action, i'd ask myself what are your options?  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you know that his actions have very little to do with you and more to do with him, right?  EOS 3 0 10 Well, I could move out but I can't afford to rent a flat on my own. I'd have to move in with my parents, realistically.  EOS 3 0 11 I keep telling myself that but I feel really betrayed. I keep wondering what she is like and whether she is prettier and more successful than me.  EOS 3 1 12 [Question] are your parents supportive of that idea?  EOS 3 0 13 I have not really talked to them about it. I feel a bit ashamed having to admit to them that my relationship has not worked out.  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it's not about her or you. it's about him.  EOS 3 0 15 But I can't help thinking that perhaps I did something wrong that made him stray?  EOS 3 1 16 [Information] they will understand. opening up to them will be the hardest part. it's a shame cocktail, but it's not one you made  EOS 3 0 17 Do you think that there is any point at all in trying to mend things at this stage? He has promised he will not see her again but I don't think I could ever trust him.  EOS 3 1 18 [Information] it's in our nature as women to ask "what did I do?" but it is never about us or anything we did.  EOS 3 0 19 Thank you, I am really glad that you understand. I don't feel that I will ever be able to trust any man again!  EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] trust and vunerability is huge in a relationship. i'd look for professional help if you wan tot try and work on it  EOS 3 0 21 I can't really afford professional help. And I don't want to be a burden on my friends. I worry that I am already annoying them.  EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] do you have a friend who has been through a similar situation? sometime that helps. also, sharing your burden with someone does NOT add to their burden  EOS 3 0 23 I do have a friend who has been through the same though ironically it is a male friend whose wife cheated on him!  EOS 3 1 24 [Information] my guess is he felt the same way you are feeling right now  EOS 3 0 25 Yes. It is just such a deep betrayal. I think I could have forgiven him if it had just been a one time mistake but he had been seeing her for ages.  EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] watch the brene brown video on youtube with the cartoon animal about empathy - it should help when looking for friends to rely upon 
[reference_response]	watch the brene brown video on youtube with the cartoon animal about empathy - it should help when looking for friends to rely upon
[hypothesis_response]	if it was just a one - time mistake, it would be understandable. if it were a second time, then i would think that it would make sense to forgive him. but i think it is better to give him some time. it might not be the best idea to be honest with him and say he is going through this again, but at least he doesn't have to be ashamed of it.
[comet query]	Yes. It is just such a deep betrayal. I think I could have forgiven him if it had just been a one time mistake but he had been seeing her for ages.

EOS 1 0 2 oh i am totally pissed off at my friend  EOS 1 0 3 he is an intelligent person....and was (is?) a close friend...but...he became an antivaxxer....critical of me for wanting a covid vaccine  EOS 1 0 4 it became unbearable....i got so mad i just cut off communication....i don't understand his pushiness.  EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Oh that's not good. Has he been putting pressure on you not to get the vaccine?  EOS 1 0 6 yes  EOS 1 0 7 i said "lets agree to disagree" but he could not accept that  EOS 1 0 8 it's like he felt it was his duty to "save me"  EOS 1 0 9 i feel disrespected, basically  EOS 1 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know it can be really frustrating. I 've had a friend like that before. Would cutting him out of your life make you more upset?  EOS 1 0 11 i'm not sure...but i have...and i miss him!  EOS 1 1 12 [Question] Or would you like to continue the relationship, but maybe not now?  EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I think that's something you need to think about.  EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I mean he sounds kind of important to you that it's making you feel like this.  EOS 1 0 15 i think maybe once covid blows over things might get back to where they were, i think that's what i want  EOS 1 0 16 but part of me is just hurt and doesn't want something like this to happen again with him  EOS 1 0 17 he is important to me, yes  EOS 1 0 18 we have been friends for 20 years, he's one of my oldest friends  EOS 1 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I really understand how you feel. Honestly the best thing I did was cool off a little and think how I want to take this friendship forward.

EOS 4 0 2 I have been working for about 4 months, but I just am not as fast at it as everyone else. I'm trying so hard working late and everything but it's never enough.  EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That can be hard when you are working so hard to try to do your best. Can you consult with a supervisor or co-workers to get some help?  EOS 4 0 4 Maybe I could ask my friend and co-worker for some tips. I'm a little embarrassed to do so, but don't know where to turn. I don't want to get fired.  EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Asking for help isn't always a bad thing. I asked for help at my last job and they gave me someone to help out. I was so relieved.  EOS 4 0 6 That's true maybe it could turn out for the better. But what if they see me as incompetant?  EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I can see that you have worry of being seen incompetent but as long as you are doing your best, they have to see the efforts you are making as positive.  EOS 4 0 8 That's a good way to put it.  EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes deep breaths can help keep you calm when approaching others in an anxiety provoking situation.

[contxt]	0 0 1 Hello. Thanks for helping me today.  EOS 0 1 2 [Question] No problem! How can I help you?  EOS 0 0 3 I'm feeling anxious about finding work and and impatient with the application process at many places I"ve applied.  EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So from what I am understanding, you have been applying for jobs and you are having anxiety about finding one and waiting through the application process.  EOS 0 0 5 Yes thats right. I keep trying and feel like I"m not getting anywhere.  EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Just from the few messages we have shared I can tell how anxious this is making you.  EOS 0 0 7 Yes. I think that I might have to try to find a different type of work than I"m used to and I'm not sure I'll be good at trying something new.  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I just recently went through a layoff at my company, and I had the same situation trying to find another job. It is very stressful.  EOS 0 0 9 I wish that I could get more of a reason than just a denial of my application. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong and most companies won't give any feedback.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] What have you done to reach out for feedback from the companies? Often it helps to send e-mails or make phone calls to have them give you some feedback.  EOS 0 0 11 I haven't tried reaching out. Most of the places I"ve been applying are huge corporations with no one to call at HR. Maybe I should try to apply somewhere locally and see if I have better luck. At least then I could talk to a person.  EOS 0 1 12 [Others] I think that would be a great start!  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] It also might help to get business cards from the people you interview with in order to be able to reach out to them in the future.  EOS 0 0 14 Thats a great idea. I've been considering going back to school to see if I can maybe get a higher degree.  EOS 0 0 15 Ive got a Bachelors degree now and it seems like everything takes a Masters degree these days.  EOS 0 1 16 [Question] What type of work are you interested in?  EOS 0 0 17 What I'm most interested in is importing and exporting of exotic fruit but the recent restrictions on travel have really hurt the business.  EOS 0 0 18 I've been thinking maybe I'll go back to school for something more practical like plumbing  EOS 0 1 19 [Information] I think that would be a great idea! It has been shown that people with higher level degrees make more money and have more opportunity than those without,  EOS 0 0 20 Ugh getting accepted for a masters program sounds stressful. I'm thinking I can't go wrong by becoming a plumber or an electrician. Everyone always needs that, even with the pandemic.  EOS 0 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] I think learning a trade would also be a great idea! I would definitely reach out to see where you can start that process. 
[reference_response]	i think learning a trade would also be a great idea! i would definitely reach out to see where you can start that process.
[hypothesis_response]	it sounds like you have a great goal and it sounds that you are really looking forward to it. i know that you have done your best and you seem like a good person who cares for yourself. i wish you the best of luck and i hope that you will find a great job!

I ended up stopping school last time because Covid started, but its been almost a year, and I feel that I will never finish if I dont go back during spring semester.  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] Your worry is very understandable, have you talked to your professors about that to see what they can help?  EOS 0 0 10 I have not because I am not currently enrolled. I have talked to admissions who said I can wait or restart when ever I wish.  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that sounds great.

[reference_response]	that sounds great. i find that your mindset is very important, you can only finish great if you feel at ease. why don't you just wait and study on your own first, and officially start when you feel reassured?

I got into boxing and it's a great way to get in shape and have an emotional release.  EOS 4 0 15 I took up running and yoga. I stopped going to the gym. What else did you do?  EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I rehabbed a bunch of my houseplants. I had some really sad looking pothos plants and I started reading about how to revitalize them.  EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] I got them healthy enough to start a second generation from cuttings, and it was such simple, calm work, it was almost like meditation.  EOS 4 0 18 That is interesting. I will look into that! I just want to keep my mind off of the break up.  EOS 4 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is totally understandable, and I think you can do it.  EOS 4 0 20 She not worth this trouble any way. I’ll find someone better!  EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You will find someone that will be a better fit, that is to be sure.  EOS 4 0 22 Definitely. I may just hook up in the meantime.

EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I would be happy to listen and help if I can :)  EOS 6 1 4 [Question] When did you notice you had a problem with alcohol?  EOS 6 0 5 The thing is I am drinking beer almost every day since I started to work from home. And with weather so nice in upcoming weeks I can't see myself stop drinking.  EOS 6 1 6 [Question] How many beer a day do you typically drink?  EOS 6 0 7 At least 4 pints. A lot of money goes on drinks as well.  EOS 6 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. So if I understand correctly, you are concerned because you are drinking more than you used to, more frequently, and you are afraid you cannot stop? And it's affecting you financially?  EOS 6 0 9 Yes, that's right. And I know I should stop but I just got addicted.  EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's really great that you have the insight to see that it may be a problem...that awareness is the most important first step!  EOS 6 0 11 Thank you for understanding  EOS 6 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I haven't experienced addictions but I have been supporting my daughter with her addiction for many years, and I have seen how challenging it's been for her.

Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID-19 lockdowns.  EOS 4 1 13 [Question] How long have you been working there?  EOS 4 0 14 I am very sad about this country and my work situation.  EOS 4 0 15 For 5 years. I work in accounting.  EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID-19 really has got us all down.

EOS 4 0 20 Yeah, I have not told my wife about it just yet.  EOS 4 1 21 [Others] I agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them  EOS 4 1 22 [Question] Uh, oh, how do you think she will react?  EOS 4 0 23 Yeah, I am not sure. I better wait to break the news in 2021.  EOS 4 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] The good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there.

EOS 0 0 3 Yes because I am overeating a lot of sugar and junk food. And I can't sleep  EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Please try not to worry, this is a very common thing to happen to people. I will try to help you all that I can.  EOS 0 0 5 Right, I can't decide what I should do, should I leave my job or not.  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Do you feel as though another job might be more intellectually fulfilling for you?  EOS 0 0 7 That's a really good question. I think it would, but I'm worried I wont be any good at it.  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I understand how difficult it can be to take what might be a life changing move. I have been in that position myself. I can't tell you what to do but I can say that it worked out very well for me.  EOS 0 0 9 I don't like feeling lots of anxiety, so I feel like I want to keep doing what I'm doing. But then I don't want to miss out on this new opportunity.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Have you contemplated seeing your doctor? They might be able to help with your anxiety.  EOS 0 0 11 I haven't thought about seeing a doctor. It could help. But I also feel like nothing can help me.  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know things can feel hopeless when you're in a bad mental place but please don't lose hope. Things will definitely improve but I think you should take steps to help yourself too  EOS 0 0 13 Yes, that is it, it feels hopeless. I've always had so much anxiety over my life, I'm so sick of it. I wish I could just feel calm for a little bit.  EOS 0 1 14 [Information] I know that a very large percent of the population suffers from anxiety at some point or another. There are therapies that can help.  EOS 0 0 15 Maybe I should seek treatment, I haven't thought about doing that.  EOS 0 1 16 [Information] There are lots of different routes you can go down when it comes to treatment.

[contxt]	1 1 6 [Self-disclosure] It depends on the depth of the relationship between the three of you. How long have you all been friends?  EOS 1 0 7 About 6 years. Our daughters are also friends, too. I am single so I don't care about the husband but also don't want to come in between their marriage.  EOS 1 1 8 [Information] Yes, that is a difficult situation to know how to handle. It could be in your best interest to leave your friend out of it so she doesn't feel stuck in the middle or forced to take sides. However she could view the opposite as you going behind her back.  EOS 1 0 9 yes that's true. I don't want to go behind her back but also don't want to get her involved. I could have the coach talk to the dad maybe?  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Yes, coaches are a great resource for life's dilemmas. Perhaps another option would be to casually mention something to him in passing, like at one your daughters games as to avoid any big blowups or emotional exlosions.  EOS 1 0 11 Oh that's a good idea - in public and not making a big deal about it - and before she moves teams and rumors get worse.  EOS 1 1 12 [Others] That is exactly right. Each person handles and avoids conflict differently and you have the important roll as leader in all of this. There is a chance he is not aware of the strain this has put on you emotionally and he could respond well to not being called out by someone else. Does that make sense?  EOS 1 0 13 it does - but doesn't seem that he cares about my strain on my life since he's the one spreading such lies about me. I just hate him!  EOS 1 1 14 [Question] I can understand how you would feel like he doesn't care about the strain it's placed. Can I ask, are your daughters aware or involved in these rumor's? This could make a difference in how you could respond.  EOS 1 0 15 I did tell her because I was so mad when another mom told me. She doesn't care. She still likes the friend but not the dad.  EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Sounds like your daughter has a good head on her shoulders. Maybe there's something to be learned from her reaction to all of this. I understand how hard this has been for you so perhaps simply ignoring the rumors will allow you to heal quicker, by simply being the bigger person. Because rumors are just rumors, after all. You and your daughter know the truth and that's all that matters.  EOS 1 0 17 yes you're right. I will try to just ignore. And figure out what to do with my anger over all this? Maybe go for a run and also avoid him?  EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] If he knows you know and you rise above with a smile on your face, that could show him that you are more mature than his childish games, and that you mean business. By taking ownership of your own feelings and emotions, you might find that will squash your need to let out any anger towards him.  EOS 1 0 19 oh I like that and I am willing to try. I am tired of wasting my energy being so angry at this man who like you said is jealous which is HIS problem and shouldn't be might, right?!  EOS 1 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Exactly. Let his problems remain his. You worry about you and your daughter and he can watch from a distance confused at his failed attempt to reflect his own dissatisfaction with life onto you didn't work. I think you will feel freed of any stress this has caused. 
[reference_response]	exactly. let his problems remain his. you worry about you and your daughter and he can watch from a distance confused at his failed attempt to reflect his own dissatisfaction with life onto you didn't work. i think you will feel freed of any stress this has caused.

EOS 0 0 4 My friends and my family place a lot of value on how one looks. Every time I meet with them they have a comment on how I should improve on something. It makes me stressed out because I feel like I am not good enough.  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] I am sorry you are having to deal with this. Are you concerned about your own looks because you constantly hear this feedback from those close to you?  EOS 0 0 6 Yes. I feel that I am not thin enough, pretty enough, that my clothes are not nice enough etc  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] I myself have gone through similar feelings when I was a teenager. I had body image issues for the longest time and my way of resolving it was through proper diet and exercise. Are you happy with how you look personally irrespective of what others opinions are?  EOS 0 0 8 It is hard to feel ok when I keep hearing that I am missing something. I don't even think I need to lose weight. It is just that my friends think model thin is what beauty is. I would have to starve myself to achieve that.  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] If you are comfortable with your weight then why are you so concerned with what everyone around you says or thinks?  EOS 0 0 10 Because they are the people I spend time with. I want to be accepted and I want them to like me.  EOS 0 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you care more about what others think of you than how you feel about yourself. 
[reference_response]	it sounds like you care more about what others think of you than how you feel about yourself.
[hypothesis_response]	that sounds very difficult. i have also been in your shoes and i know how hard it is to be rejected. what i would advice you to do is to take a deep breath and relax and keep your mind busy. that will help you feel better.

EOS 4 1 3 [Others] I am doing swell  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] What's on your mind today?  EOS 4 0 5 I really want to ask how you are doing and what issues you are having, I have done like 5 of these on the supportive side. I have been getting migraines lately which is making my depression worse  EOS 4 1 6 [Question] How long has this depression been looming over you?  EOS 4 0 7 Pretty much my whole adult life, at least 12 years or so  EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, you mentioned that you have been getting migraines lately though you have been depressed for a longer duration, lets try to pinpoint that cause first  EOS 4 0 9 I honestly have a pretty good handle on the depression, lots of therapy. The migraines are making it hard to get anything done though  EOS 4 1 10 [Question] Would you say that the migraines are a result of working?  EOS 4 0 11 I am honestly not sure, I have gotten one in my entire life before and 6 in the last month. I dont think that it is stress related  EOS 4 1 12 [Others] you'd be surprised as how much stress actually does to the mind itself. Has anything in your daily life, in the past month alone, changed that would lead to increased stress that you wouldn't normally experience?  EOS 4 0 13 Honestly not really, things are going well at work and life is actually going well  EOS 4 1 14 [Question] from where I am, most businesses require us to work form home. Is this true for you?  EOS 4 0 15 No I am stuck going into work, we are essential enough to stay open  EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Ah, I also know some essential workers who must physically attend work. I am lead to believe that the pandemic inadvertently causes a lot of stress in places that we don't commonly associate stress with. For example, wearing a mask everywhere for us in the United States can become a pain sometimes like when I forget it in the car or the house  EOS 4 0 17 Yes honestly covid has definitely been exhausting. masks have been mandatory here for quite some time so I am never without one  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I don't blame you, its impossible to keep this composure especially with a pandemic breathing down our necks. When I worked, I found that smaller problems that wouldn't normally phase me began to have a greater effect when the pandemic hit  EOS 4 1 19 [Others] Thus my stress went up as a result and wearing a mask didn't help the problem  EOS 4 0 20 Honestly I wear a mask 8 hours a day and its not a big deal  EOS 4 1 21 [Question] Hmm I guess we all deal with the precautionary measure differently. Has your daily routine changed at all in the past month?  EOS 4 0 22 Not much has changed  EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] are you able to identify any change whatsoever? I ask since any imbalance our body and mind experience is sometimes enough to see a poor reaction, that may lead to things such as migraines

[contxt]	1 0 5 Sometimes I feel like it must be me. Maybe i',m annoying? This happens so often the common denominator is ME. But i'm friendly, im assertive, im out spoken, im kind. I don't LET people walk all over me but it seems like that;s all I attract.  EOS 1 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel under valued in your relationships because people tend to take advantage of you.  EOS 1 0 7 Pretty much. it just happens every single time. It's kind of discouraging and just makes me an angry person  EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this is really bothering you. It is good that you are talking about it though.  EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried telling them how they make you feel?  EOS 1 0 10 Some of them. The others I never even get a chance because they just ignore my existence anytime I try and reach out to talk. I've just been waiting for them to pour their problems onto me or have the nerve to ask for money. Then i'll tell them. I already know they won't respond but atleast ill say my peace  EOS 1 1 11 [Question] After you tell them how you feel do you still give them money or listen to what's going on and try to help them.  EOS 1 0 12 No. Whenever I do get to say my peace, i'll just cut contact completely. Lately i've been holding it in and just barely responding if at all.  EOS 1 0 13 I've told one of them that i have no money and she hasn't contacted me since. But if she tries again i'll say something about the issue. I don't like feeling used. Who even has the nerve to blatantly use somebody like that? It's irritating  EOS 1 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's good that you let them know how you feel. By doing that, you are taking the first step in now allowing them to take advantage of you  EOS 1 0 15 Agreed. I just hope that one day I can meet people and form actual friendships with them  EOS 1 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's really hard to stand up for yourself but it sounds like you are off to a good start.  EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] Have you taken any steps in trying to form new more meaningful relationships  EOS 1 0 18 I thought I did. My husband and I made a couple friends. Theyre a couple and so are we so we go on double dates but they seem more drawn to him. Me and the other girl got very close and then boom she randomly decided she only wants to talk to me when shes mad or bored  EOS 1 1 19 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So feel that this new couple might value the friendship with your husband more then you  EOS 1 0 20 yeah it seems that way. Most people like him more than me and it's weird because he sucks at socializing and doesn't even like them that much  EOS 1 0 21 It just doens't make sense but that's just the way the ca rds were dealt  EOS 1 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I used to have a hard time forming a meaningful relationship but then I realized it's because I had nothing in common with the people I was trying to form them with. Once I discovered something I was really drawn to I met people that way like volunteering in my community. Have you tried finding people you have more in common with.

EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Can you share more about it?  EOS 0 0 5 i feel like my life is an unscheduled mess. nothing ever happens when its supposed to  EOS 0 0 6 i plan things and it always falls through and doesnt happen  EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like the chaos and disorganization is really bother you. Is that right?  EOS 0 0 8 yes  EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I can certainly understand. When my children were young and I worked full-time outside of the home, I found it very difficult to keep things in my life organized.  EOS 0 0 10 my partners schedule changes about 3 times a day. so i never know if what i had planned will happen or not. usually not.  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] I can understand why that may frustrate you.  EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Does your partner have any control over their schedule and the changes?  EOS 0 0 13 i stay home all the time and even our plans for doing things at home fall through. he will promise to do something simple and months later its still not done  EOS 0 0 14 its supposed to be a set schedule but something always come up and he ends up working anywhere from 10 to 12 hours  EOS 0 1 15 [Information] This can be very stressful and lead to a lot of problems in a relationship if not dealt with early.  EOS 0 0 16 its more of the reasons why he has to work late that bother me  EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried hanging a large calendar and writing down his schedule as well as any plans you made? Then each morning, do a quick 1-minute check on the calendar to ensure you are BOTH on the same page.  EOS 0 1 18 [Question] Can you tell me about the reason?  EOS 0 0 19 the people he works with either screw up a machine or flake out not even working an 8 hour shift. yet my other half is always the one to stay  EOS 0 1 20 [Question] Is he aware of your concerns?  EOS 0 0 21 i mean i admire his work ethic but why does it always have to fall on him to be the one to stay  EOS 0 0 22 we have talked about it often  EOS 0 1 23 [Self-disclosure] I feel like I had very similar issues in my first marriage.  EOS 0 0 24 it makes my anxiety go crazy  EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] Communication can be very key here.  EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like he is dedicated to his job, which can be a good thing, but I do understand that you want to be put first sometimes as well. 
[reference_response]	it sounds like he is dedicated to his job, which can be a good thing, but i do understand that you want to be put first sometimes as well.
[hypothesis_response]	that is a really difficult situation. it sounds you are in a good place, and i would recommend talking to your partner and letting them know you feel as though you are not in the best place as a person. i would suggest trying to keep in touch with him and tell him how you are feeling and that you are willing to make him change his schedule.

[contxt]	4 0 1 Hello. I suppose I could be doing better.  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Anything in particular you're having a hard time with?  EOS 4 0 3 Yep. Thanks for asking. It feels to me like my GF and I may be breaking up.  EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry, I've been in that position before. Do you feel it's for the best?  EOS 4 0 5 No. I am very sad about it. She recently informed me shes going to go a graduate school far away after I made the decision to come to school near where she lives.  EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That's really hard, especially when there's chance it could have worked out if it wasn't for the distance. Do you regret choosing to go to the school near where she lives?  EOS 4 0 7 Yes. I feel like I put my life on hold for someone else only to have them throw me to the curve.  EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Definitely feeling like you're living for someone else and having them not do the same is hurtful. Although it seems like you're the one in the relationship who is willing to make more sacrifices  EOS 4 0 9 At this point, yes.  EOS 4 0 10 I just wish we would of talked about this a year ago when I uprooted my life the first time.  EOS 4 0 11 I fear that this will continue to happen.  EOS 4 1 12 [Others] Oh ok then it's not the first time this has happened.  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you might be right, if you notice a pattern then it might continue to happen  EOS 4 0 14 So you think this will continue to happen?  EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Most likely, she seems to need space to live for herself and is less willing to make sacrifices for you like you do for her  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] But even it won't happen again, you shouldn't have to live worrying that it will  EOS 4 1 17 [Question] Have you spoken to her about how you feel? 
[reference_response]	have you spoken to her about how you feel?
[hypothesis_response]	i think it'll be a good idea to talk to her about it as well. it'd be nice to be able to talk about it with her.

[contxt]	1 0 0 I am very upset  EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today?  EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Im sorry to hear your upset. Do you want to go into why you are?  EOS 1 0 3 A friend of more than 20 years hurt me deeply by judging me for not buying a gift for my nephew for his birthday.  EOS 1 1 4 [Question] Why would they judge you on that? Do they know your nephew as well?  EOS 1 0 5 Yes, she is very close friends with my nephew's mother as well. She is the kind of person who will go into deep debt and overdraw her bank account to buy someone a gift, I am not. I could not afford the gift, I am disabled and on a very minimal income.  EOS 1 1 6 [Question] That i can relate too, i am also disabled and on SSI. Have you spoken to her about how she upset you?  EOS 1 0 7 I did. I took a few days to cool off and then told her that her comments hurt me. I know that she's aware of my financial situation as well as the fact that I am disabled. Her response was that she said nothing wrong.  EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Thats a tough spot to be in with a friendship that has lasted so long. Does she tend to treat you like this regularly?  EOS 1 0 9 No, she really never has. Typically, she feels like other people walk all over her and take advantage of her, but that's never been me and its never been our relationship.  EOS 1 1 10 [Information] Then would you say its a little odd for her to be acting in this manner towards you?  EOS 1 0 11 Yes, quite. At times over the years she can become quite self absorbed. But she's never been so downright hurtful. I can't really see a way for our relationship to be the same anymore.  EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I would agree that the relationship is getting a bit toxic but before terminating such a long relationship i would do one thing. I would try to see if there is something going on in her life right now for her to be acting like this. Sometimes people dont know how to talk about something thats bothering then and it in turn comes out as anger or spite.  EOS 1 0 13 That's true. We've been through a lot together over the years. But I can't deny that what she said hurt, and our conversations are just so superficial now.  EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. It might be time to end the friendship. I would do that as a last resort but there is no need for you to be carrying it one sided and holding all the burden as well. It hurts to have to end a long friendship but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen to keep yourself in a better spot. 
[reference_response]	yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. it might be time to end the friendship. i would do that as a last resort but there is no need for you to be carrying it one sided and holding all the burden as well. it hurts to have to end a long friendship but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen to keep yourself in a better spot.
[hypothesis_response]	i can understand how you feel. i think that if you tell her that, she might end up acting the same way again.

EOS 0 0 3 I'm doing well, but it could have been better  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What seems to be bothering you tonight?  EOS 0 0 5 Yes, my boy friend of 3 years has refused to take our relationship to the next level and I'm kind of getting tired, I don't want to play games anymore  EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don't feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,  EOS 0 0 7 exactly, I hate to feel that I'm wasting my time  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand that, as I was in a long term relationship and I felt as though my girlfriend at the time did not want to take things to the next step and I was not happy about it.  EOS 0 0 9 Yes, I love him so dearly to want to settle down with him, but if he doesn't want that for me I would rather call it quits now than continue and be disappointed at the long run.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Have you had that conversation with him? I know it might be a difficult conversation to have, but it is often good to get expectations out in the open so you are on the same page with your partner .  EOS 0 0 11 Yes, sort of and he gave me the impression that he is not there yet and that was a like almost a year ago, I don't want it to look like I'm pushing him if I try to talk to him again about it. His nonchalant attitude in not seeing the seriousness of it is killing me, I'm just not happy.  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] That is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance I am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications.  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] I don't think it would be pushing if you haven't had that conversation in almost a year.  EOS 0 0 14 I hope you are right, just don't want to come across as a desperate person and that's why I'm setting myself up to call it quits if he tries to sound like he sounded the last time.  EOS 0 1 15 [Others] You need to know where he is so you can make a good decision for yourself!  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know it is difficult, but I know you can get through it!  EOS 0 0 17 You are right, that's exactly what I'm going to do because the wait is killing me.  EOS 0 1 18 [Others] Good, I am happy for you!  EOS 0 0 19 Thank you very much, you've been a great help  EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I am glad I was able to help!  EOS 0 0 21 Thanks, it was nice chatting with you.  EOS 0 1 22 [Others] You're welcome!

[contxt]	7 0 0 Hi :)  EOS 7 1 1 [Question] Hiya! =) How are you doing, today?  EOS 7 0 2 I'm feeling really stressed about university, to be honest.  EOS 7 0 3 I'm really struggling to find motivation to complete my assignments  EOS 7 0 4 And it's stressing me out how little work I've completed even though deadlines are coming up.  EOS 7 1 5 [Question] I totally understand that. Which year are you in?  EOS 7 0 6 I'm in my final year, having to juggle my dissertation with what feels like a million other assignments  EOS 7 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh goodness, I can't imagine how stressful that would be. I've only gotten my associates, and I found that last semester to be a slough. But what kept me going was the relief and joy I would feel once I had that diploma in hand.  EOS 7 1 8 [Others] Are there any study groups or classmates you can get together with, and basically make a night of it?  EOS 7 0 9 I don't really have any friends on the course, I'm pretty shy and don't really feel comfortable talking to anyone. I kinda promised myself to make more friends in my final year, but obviously circumstances have changed :/  EOS 7 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Very true, this year made everyone's expectations and plans go out the window lol  EOS 7 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] It might be time to put yourself out of your comfort zone, but start small. Are there any clubs or groups associated with your major? That way, you have some common ground to work with.  EOS 7 0 12 I'm honestly not sure, I guess I've always been too nervous to reach out to anyone. I'll have to have a look.  EOS 7 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] That sounds like a good idea =) Even if you can't hold club meetings on campus or have any gatherings, maybe they hold their meetings over video calls. One plus side to that, is that you don't need to have your camera on to participate.  EOS 7 0 14 That's true. I also feel a bit nervous about my final grades, I've done well so far but just feel like this year might mess everything up.  EOS 7 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's understandable, especially with how the past year has been. Everyone is on edge and everything feels so uncertain, but that's okay, because you're not alone =)  EOS 7 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You said you're doing well so far? Take pride in that, and focus on that. "If I've been doing well so far, I must be doing something right. I'll just keep doing what I have been, and everything should work out in the end."  EOS 7 0 17 Yeah, I am really proud of what I've done so far but it just makes me worry that I won't meet my own expectations  EOS 7 1 18 [Self-disclosure] We can be our own worst critics, and that's never been truer than when we're facing a challenge. Self-doubt can be such a pain, but when I find I'm having trouble believing in myself and working toward my goals, I'll focus on what I already accomplished, and that helps give me that extra push to keep going

[contxt]	6 0 7 What happened out of interest when you had the conversation?  EOS 6 1 8 [Others] Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist.  EOS 6 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more. Since that time, he denies everything.  EOS 6 0 10 I know. I'm a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It's superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas 'punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends.  EOS 6 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly, its not anyone else's business. IF you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o=is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER!  EOS 6 1 12 [Question] Curiously, why do you think she's cheating?  EOS 6 0 13 I'm almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two.  EOS 6 1 14 [Question] Hmm... So have you two live together? How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation?  EOS 6 0 15 That's just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven't approached it with her because I'm scared see will just leave and I'll be a laughing stock. I suppose I'm a joke either way!  EOS 6 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There's always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.  EOS 6 0 17 very true. I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think I should just talk to her?  EOS 6 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you.  EOS 6 0 19 not at all. I appreciate your candour.  EOS 6 1 20 [Question] But if you feel as though you're a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you're getting hurt? I know that you don't want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty? 
[reference_response]	but if you feel as though you're a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you're getting hurt? i know that you don't want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty?
[hypothesis_response]	i've been in the situation where i had a partner who would take my phone and i could not see him for days. i would go out and spend time with him and tell him about it. he would take it and come back. i wouldn't tell him or him, i'd say, that i was cheating on him and he would not be able to see me. i found out that i wasn't cheating on her, and that i had to find a new partner. so i would say that you really don'thing that she is going through this right now, but rather that you are not getting enough time to let alone to find the fact.

[contxt]	3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] At this point, you will have to ask your family to make time to talk with you and im sure they will understand if they hear where you are coming from  EOS 3 0 7 That is a good idea, I can reach out to my mom. Maybe I should write her an email or something?My brother was a bully and so he is a big reason that I moved. My parents encouraged us to fight and argue, it wasn't a very fun place to live.  EOS 3 0 8 I've always been closer to my mom so she is much more understanding. She helps me pay my monthly bills too.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah reach out to your mum, and although you fight and argue, they are still your family at the end of the day  EOS 3 1 10 [Others] Thats nice of her :)  EOS 3 0 11 Yes, that is a good point. I have always heard the blood is thicker than water.  EOS 3 0 12 I have also been upset lately because I had to leave all my pets when I moved out. I left my dog and my cat back at home.  EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Have you visited them ever since?  EOS 3 0 14 No, I am too far away to stop by or go for the weekend. I would have to plan a whole trip and I cant really afford it yet. My brother knew that the pets were mine but he demanded that he keep them there and I didnt want to fight with him so I said fine.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] If they are your pets you should be able to keep them but you did the right thing as to not argue with your brother and your parents could help you look after them  EOS 3 0 16 Yeah, you are right. Once he let the gate open just so my dog would run away, he says he didn't do it but I know him and he is really mean and vengeful. He would also pull pranks on me that were just cruel. He once told me that my cat was ran over but he was just hiding her at a friends house for a week.  EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, he doesn't seem very nice, but its good that you don't retaliate negatively  EOS 3 0 18 Yeah, I used to be really depressed living there. I haven't thought about why I moved but you are helping me remember that i'm better off now. I am lonely but so much happier not living in the turmoil over there.  EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Its a good thing you moved then because at least now you are away from him  EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You should always try to be happy  EOS 3 0 21 Yep, I am feeling better today . Thank you for listening. Maybe I should just get a new rescue dog or something like that today? I don't want to dwell on my brother or that negativity. I am feeling a lot more hopeful just sharing my feelings.  EOS 3 1 22 [Others] Yes its good to not dwell on the past like that. Have a good day :) 
[reference_response]	yes its good to not dwell on the past like that. have a good day : )

[contxt]	4 0 1 How empty my life is.  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Why do you feel like your life is empty?  EOS 4 0 3 The love of my life is no longer in my life.  EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm really sorry to hear that.  EOS 4 0 5 Yes, she left me for her supervisor at work.  EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Was this a recent event?  EOS 4 0 7 Yes, five days ago.  EOS 4 1 8 [Question] Wow, that's really a hard thing to deal with isn't it?  EOS 4 0 9 It sure is. She told me this guy was sexually harassing her at work, then I find out she is leaving me for this guy.  EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hmm, it sounds like she isn't being completely honest with you.  EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I've been left before too. It was one of the most painful experiences of my life.  EOS 4 0 12 I think she liked all of the attention he was giving her, and then she got turned on by it. It is sick.  EOS 4 0 13 I can't believe anyone would ever leave you, you seem like such a nice person.  EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe she did like the attention, but that is her own issue. It really doesn't have anything to do with you.  EOS 4 1 15 [Information] Sometimes low self worth makes a person seek that kind of exterior validation from someone else.  EOS 4 0 16 I should have followed and stalked her like this guy did, it seems to turn her on, she said she likes being watched. I told her to see a therapist and she told me to leave our apartmnent.  EOS 4 1 17 [Question] That doesn't sound healthy to you, does it?  EOS 4 0 18 Yes, I think she has low self esteem, but she let me do things with her, we would experiment sexually together, it was wild.  EOS 4 0 19 But now I think she is not healthy and has mental issues.  EOS 4 1 20 [Question] so, do you think that was the only way she could connect with you, through sex?  EOS 4 0 21 I think so, she also liked to peg me. It was very intense, I have never submitted like that to anyone.  EOS 4 1 22 [Question] Is this your first serious relationship?  EOS 4 0 23 Yes, I guess I don't have good luck with women. Maybe I need to go back to call girls, they are easier to deal with.  EOS 4 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you enjoyed the sex a lot, but you also want an emotional connection to a woman.  EOS 4 0 25 Yes totally. Some of the prostitutes are very sweet, but they don't want anything too long term. Just a weekend at most.  EOS 4 0 26 Well thank you, you have been very helpful, I feel better now.

EOS 3 0 5 Only part time  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Is there any chance of increasing your hours? What is your relationship with your sibling like?  EOS 3 0 7 No i can't ... we are good but still you won't have that control on your privacy and other staffs.  EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Yes, it is difficult to have to be a dependent again when you have been used to living alone. I had to do that myself once over fifteen years ago when I was forced to move back with my parents.  EOS 3 0 9 So you know what it feels, right?  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah. It was very depressing at the time but things are much better now. I think it will be the same for you t oo!  EOS 3 0 11 let's hope so. This time it looks an everlasting piles of problems ahead..

EOS 4 1 30 [Information] Sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath.  EOS 4 0 31 Maybe I can spend some quality time with my kids without them knowing I will be out of a job as of 01/15/2021  EOS 4 0 32 It is almost Christmas, too.  EOS 4 1 33 [Information] I hear ya, I feel like that quite a bit. Like if isn't one thing it's another. I'm sure your wife will understand how the economy has gotten and that she knows that it isn't your fault.  EOS 4 0 34 Maybe, but we have a huge mortgage and two BMW's. We spend lavishly....  EOS 4 0 35 Plus, I spend 50 dollars a day on lotto  EOS 4 1 36 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes it's hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had. Those would not be good times if it were'nt for tough times.  EOS 4 0 37 True, but the Office was my home away from home. I need to figure out how to deal with my sadness.....  EOS 4 1 38 [Providing Suggestions] Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times.  EOS 4 1 39 [Question] Do you have any hobbies?  EOS 4 0 40 Yeah, that is a good point. Should I change careers?  EOS 4 0 41 I like to walk and do pushups on a regular basis; does that count??  EOS 4 1 42 [Others] I don't think a huge change like that is neccessary, maybe just looking into options. Unemployment and government help until something else comes up.  EOS 4 1 43 [Others] That is an excellent way to help relieve some stress from our daily lives.  EOS 4 0 44 Unemployment doesn't last forever; plus, I have pride in my work. Americans are suppose to be strong.  EOS 4 1 45 [Providing Suggestions] Exercise also releases endorphins that can make you feel happy.  EOS 4 0 46 Any other suggestions? I was thinking about becoming an Uber and Lyft driver.  EOS 4 0 47 The happiness wears off, however.  EOS 4 1 48 [Reflection of feelings] I like to hear that, I am a proud American myself.

EOS 4 1 51 [Others] It does wear off, but if you get into a routine of doing it, it will help to alleviate some of that sadness  EOS 4 1 52 [Others] Ok thank you I hope things get going in the right direction for you.

EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] i admire people who have natural curls  EOS 4 0 4 They are unruly and not the pretty kind of curls. Often get frizzy by the end of the day. It get's frustrating when I always look a mess.  EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I could see that being frustrating, if you can't keep them neat.  EOS 4 1 6 [Question] is your hair short or long?  EOS 4 0 7 It is long.  EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] have you thought of having it shorter, it might be easier to tame?  EOS 4 1 9 [Question] Just a thought....you say you always look like a mess...is that your personal opinion or has anyone else commented on your hair?  EOS 4 0 10 I started to cut it shorter last time, but my stylist said it would be big. It is hard to find the right product.  EOS 4 0 11 It is my personal opinion.  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] have you asked a friend for an honest opinion?  EOS 4 0 13 My friend likes my hair, but also says she can see that it is hard to manage.  EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance.  EOS 4 0 15 I can totally relate to that.  EOS 4 0 16 I think we always want what we dont have.  EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] One thing I have started doing, since my hair hasn't been cut for a year due to pandemic, is wearing hats.

EOS 4 0 20 I went a year without cutting mine as well for the same reason. That is probably why it felt so out of control now that you say that. Now that I am vaccinated I just got it cut.

EOS 5 1 15 [Question] Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can. Has she been in contact with you?  EOS 5 0 16 no. she hasn't done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her  EOS 5 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Seems like a good idea.

EOS 5 0 8 I made a mistake making California my home.  EOS 5 1 9 [Question] I'm sure it isn't, how long had you been together?  EOS 5 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] California is beautiful I know, but it can also be pretty quick paced.  EOS 5 0 11 We were together 10 years.

Its a tough time of year for something like that.  EOS 5 1 17 [Question] Had things been pretty rocky?  EOS 5 0 18 Things like this were sudden. I mean, I never expected her to up and walk out with the kids.  EOS 5 0 19 The only thing I can think of was that California was getting too expensive and the homeless were taking over LA; that may have spooked her to leave the state.  EOS 5 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] Wow, that's horrible. It seems you should have some kind of legal authority in that aspect.  EOS 5 1 21 [Question] Is that a big problem out there?  EOS 5 0 22 I really don't have any discourse. The kids are almost 18. They are twins. Yeah, in her eyes, she seems fed up with the state. She left me for Texas, the state, not the person.  EOS 5 0 23 I mean, she never mentioned loving, "Text," but the kids are bing into the Dallas Cowboys  EOS 5 1 24 [Others] It is important that you understand that it seems that she has been thinking of this for a while.  EOS 5 0 25 I overhead her say that Texas is a free state and my twin boys do love the Dallas Cowboy's team.  EOS 5 1 26 [Question] Does she have family there?  EOS 5 0 27 Yes, she does. Both her parents live in Laredo.....big spread, too.  EOS 5 1 28 [Question] Have you spoken with her since she left?  EOS 5 0 29 Well, she left two days ago.

EOS 4 0 3 I just don't feel like I'm good enough lately  EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are experiencing feelings of inadequacy? That is very sad. Can you tell me why you think you feel this way? Has anything changed lately?  EOS 4 0 5 Yes I feel very inadequate. Recently my best friend and I can't get along. She's always upset at me about things I'm doing  EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry to hear that. I've experienced difficulties with friendships too. Do you think you can talk with her?  EOS 4 0 7 I've tried taking to her, usually she gets very angry with me and starts yelling. She never listens to what I have to say.  EOS 4 1 8 [Others] It sounds a little as though her behaviour is toxic. Does the friendship really mean that much to you?  EOS 4 0 9 She means so much to me and she's my only friend.  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] So you feel that the friendship is worth fighting for, but she is not being responsive?  EOS 4 0 11 More than that, she's not being supportive of my decisions and that's all I want  EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Was there one specific thing that triggered this or had it been coming for a long time?  EOS 4 0 13 She hates my boyfriend, she wants me to leave him. If i don't she doesn't want to hang around me as much. She said I have to choose him or her.  EOS 4 1 14 [Information] Would you consider having some counselling together? Perhaps talk through what is going on?  EOS 4 1 15 [Others] She has no right to issue you with an ultimatum like that.  EOS 4 0 16 She moved all of her things out of our dorm room we share just because I'm still with my boyfriend. I woukd do counselling but I'm not sure she would  EOS 4 1 17 [Others] I really feel as though you are the one putting all the effort in here and she is just making selfish demands on you.  EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps it is time to try and make some new friends? Join a society or something?  EOS 4 0 19 I've realized I want to spend the rest of my life with my boyfriend and I don't think she'll like that.  EOS 4 1 20 [Others] I think you know deep down what is the best thing to do. You don't need selfish people in your life.  EOS 4 0 21 I'm a little reluctant, I'm very shy and struggle with making new friends, that's why she is do important to me.  EOS 4 1 22 [Others] You have your boyfriend though :). He will always be there for you - and not treat you as badly as she has!  EOS 4 0 23 Yes that's true. What do I say to her?  EOS 4 1 24 [Others] I don't think you owe her an explanation after how she has behaved. Leave her to make the next move  EOS 4 1 25 [Others] I hope I have been able to help you a little!  EOS 4 0 26 The problem is we technically share a room. She does come in occasionally.  EOS 4 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know that you must feel that this could be a problem but I think you will be able to just ignore her. I am afraid I must leave for my next appointment now.

[contxt]	3 0 14 2 years  EOS 3 1 15 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating.  EOS 3 0 16 What do you mean exactly?  EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it.  EOS 3 0 18 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily.  EOS 3 1 19 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations.  EOS 3 0 20 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately.  EOS 3 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner.  EOS 3 0 22 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?  EOS 3 1 23 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why.  EOS 3 0 24 That is a good point.  EOS 3 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens.  EOS 3 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that.  EOS 3 0 27 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage.  EOS 3 0 28 But I appreciate your suggestions  EOS 3 0 29 and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile  EOS 3 1 30 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand.  EOS 3 0 31 I should trust my partner more than any random person.  EOS 3 1 32 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.  EOS 3 1 33 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, trust matters.  EOS 3 0 34 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better?  EOS 3 1 35 [Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you....even after work.  EOS 3 0 36 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together.  EOS 3 1 37 [Providing Suggestions] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship.  EOS 3 1 38 [Providing Suggestions] Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.  EOS 3 0 39 That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance.  EOS 3 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign.  EOS 3 1 41 [Question] How old are the both of you?  EOS 3 0 42 Okay. I will keep that in mind.  EOS 3 0 43 We are 22.  EOS 3 1 44 [Question] Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis?  EOS 3 0 45 Yes but less over the past few months.  EOS 3 1 46 [Providing Suggestions] Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings.  EOS 3 1 47 [Providing Suggestions] I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related....for him.  EOS 3 1 48 [Question] Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young.  EOS 3 1 49 [Reflection of feelings] You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other.  EOS 3 0 50 That's understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first.  EOS 3 1 51 [Providing Suggestions] How do you all generally communicate? Through text?  EOS 3 0 52 He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends.  EOS 3 1 53 [Question] Which do you and your man like to communicate?

EOS 3 0 4 Yes....well we are not living together now. We have to file papers for divorce  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] I see. So you're actually legally married - didn't just have a commitment ceremony?  EOS 3 0 6 Yes legally married  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Care to share what led up to filing for divorce?  EOS 3 0 8 She cheated.  EOS 3 0 9 And as far as I know is still with the person  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can certainly understand how that feels. I have been in your EXACT situation.  EOS 3 0 11 It's horrible and hard to move on for sure  EOS 3 1 12 [Question] How long were you with her?  EOS 3 0 13 Don't laugh  EOS 3 0 14 Our one year wedding anniversary was this past Sat. Which I know I shouldnt be so miserable but I am. I think because like some people have told me we were still in our honeymoon stage. We were not fighting or having big issues....she just cheated  EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm so incredibly sorry to hear that. You realize this behavior, these choices, are a flaw within her, and not you?  EOS 3 0 16 It's hard to see that. I feel like a failure and not good enough  EOS 3 0 17 Like why even get married in the first place if you are just going to cheat  EOS 3 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can completely understand that as well.

EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Do you have the option to move back? Because family is the most important thing at the end of the day  EOS 3 0 5 No, I was living with my mom and dad but when I moved out my brother got my room. He and I didnt get along so he would never want me to move back into the house with them either.  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] At this point, you will have to ask your family to make time to talk with you and im sure they will understand if they hear where you are coming from  EOS 3 0 7 That is a good idea, I can reach out to my mom. Maybe I should write her an email or something?My brother was a bully and so he is a big reason that I moved. My parents encouraged us to fight and argue, it wasn't a very fun place to live.  EOS 3 0 8 I've always been closer to my mom so she is much more understanding. She helps me pay my monthly bills too.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah reach out to your mum, and although you fight and argue, they are still your family at the end of the day  EOS 3 1 10 [Others] Thats nice of her :)  EOS 3 0 11 Yes, that is a good point. I have always heard the blood is thicker than water.  EOS 3 0 12 I have also been upset lately because I had to leave all my pets when I moved out. I left my dog and my cat back at home.  EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Have you visited them ever since?  EOS 3 0 14 No, I am too far away to stop by or go for the weekend. I would have to plan a whole trip and I cant really afford it yet. My brother knew that the pets were mine but he demanded that he keep them there and I didnt want to fight with him so I said fine.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] If they are your pets you should be able to keep them but you did the right thing as to not argue with your brother and your parents could help you look after them  EOS 3 0 16 Yeah, you are right. Once he let the gate open just so my dog would run away, he says he didn't do it but I know him and he is really mean and vengeful. He would also pull pranks on me that were just cruel. He once told me that my cat was ran over but he was just hiding her at a friends house for a week.  EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, he doesn't seem very nice, but its good that you don't retaliate negatively  EOS 3 0 18 Yeah, I used to be really depressed living there. I haven't thought about why I moved but you are helping me remember that i'm better off now. I am lonely but so much happier not living in the turmoil over there.  EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Its a good thing you moved then because at least now you are away from him

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hello, thanks for offering to help. My sister is battling with heroin addiction, and I am raising her children. It's quite a bit of pressure and responsibility.  EOS 0 1 1 [Others] Hi! Of course. I am happy to help.  EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh wow, that is really stressful. You are such a godo person for taking on her children. You should feel really good about yourself.  EOS 0 0 3 She has been in and out of rehab, and I see no end to her problems, other than a tragic one. Thankfully, the children are adjusting to it, probably because they are happy just to be in a stable environment.  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Are you raising them alone?  EOS 0 0 5 I have a romantic partner who helps. I also have two of my own relatively young children.  EOS 0 0 6 So, four in total.  EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That's a lot of children! It's great that you have a partner who can help you.  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] A dear friend of mine is in rehab and had to give up her children, it is really awful to watch. It makes me feel so helpless, so i understand how you msut be feeling.  EOS 0 0 9 Thanks for being sympathetic and for the words of encouragement. Yes, needless to say, Child Protective Services were involved, and I was granted Foster Parent status. I'm sure your friend went down that road, sadly.  EOS 0 0 10 Have you ever seen the video by the artist known as NF called "How Could You Leave Us?" I'm afraid that's what's next for these kids.  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, she did. Her children seem very lucky to have you. Do they get along with your children?  EOS 0 1 12 [Others] I haven't seen that, waht happens in it?  EOS 0 0 13 They all get along famously. You can find that video on YouTube. It's a true story of how his mother died from heroin addiction. It's a powerful song.  EOS 0 0 14 Hopefully, you never have to experience it. Heroin (opioids) just grabs hold of people and doesn't let go.  EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's so awful. the only thing you can do is show the kids love and make them feel cared for.  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Addiction is a truly awful disease, people don't appreciate the toll it takes on families.  EOS 0 0 17 Thank you. One piece of good news. Her son went from failing most of his classes to making Honor Roll this trimester - that's what his advisor tells me.  EOS 0 0 18 You've been really helpful and considerate. Chatting with you certainly made me feel better. I think we can end the support session at this juncture if you've met your session requirements.  EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] That's so good!!!  EOS 0 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I hope i was helpful!! have a great day and continue being such a good support for the kids. I am very impressed.  EOS 0 0 21 Thanks so, much. Have a great holiday and we'll try to do the same.  EOS 0 1 22 [Others] You too. Enjoy the holidays!!!  EOS 0 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hopefully, you all get to spend so much time togehter.

[contxt]	0 0 0 Good afternoon  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello! How are you today?  EOS 0 0 2 I have been better. Staying home due to pandemic has been challenging.  EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Me too. I know alot of people and feeling the same way right now.  EOS 0 0 4 I feel like all i do is wait on my children!  EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can agree with that! My children seems to always be needing something. It can sometimes feel overwhelming.  EOS 0 0 6 very overwhelming because there are no days off on the horizon.  EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried reaching out to friends or other family members to help take some of the load off? It may help to even get an afternoon for yourself.  EOS 0 0 8 The pandemic has kept everyone at a distance.  EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Yes this would also make me feel isolated as well.  EOS 0 0 10 without a paycheck like i received at work I also feel underappreciated  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] I have heard of some people receiving assistance from their community by supplying food and basic needs. This may be worth looking into.  EOS 0 0 12 Thats a thought... I hadn't considered looking into community help.  EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I am sure it may help relieve some of the stress your are feeling.  EOS 0 0 14 I really do need to find a way to have some personal space once in awhile  EOS 0 1 15 [Question] What type of activities do you enjoy when you do have time alone?  EOS 0 0 16 I like peace and quiet to read  EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Me too! I try to read whenever I can. It can take you out of the moment of the daily grind. I have a long list of books to get to.  EOS 0 0 18 Thank you for all your help  EOS 0 1 19 [Others] You're welcome! I am glad that I could help.

[contxt]	6 0 1 Hi  EOS 6 1 2 [Others] How are you doing today? Are there any particular issues you would like to discuss?  EOS 6 0 3 I think you are able to read about my situation, but if not, I've basically lost my best high school friends while in college.  EOS 6 0 4 It's pretty rough since I've known these people since I was in elementary school.  EOS 6 1 5 [Question] I'm sorry to hear that. Did that make college difficult for you?  EOS 6 0 6 It did - I had to figure out what was important in life after that but the loss of my high school friends drove me into a mild depression.  EOS 6 1 7 [Question] Of course. Do you still experience feelings of sadness when thinking of that time in your life? 
[reference_response]	of course. do you still experience feelings of sadness when thinking of that time in your life?
[hypothesis_response]	i can definitely relate to that, i had a similar experience when i went through a similar situation.

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hello!  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hi! How are you today?  EOS 0 0 2 Im really nervous about my upcoming finals :/  EOS 0 1 3 [Information] Finals can be so stressful. Have you been studying?  EOS 0 0 4 I keep trying, but it seems my nervousness from wanting to do well is clouding my mind and making it hard to study  EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can imagine. When i was in school , i had the same thing happen to me. I was so sterssed, it led to me nto being able to focus.  EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] What really helped me was practicing mindfulness.  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Are there any exercies that you like doing?  EOS 0 0 8 I like to lift weights for gaining muscle mass. Usually pushups are my favorite bodyweight exercise  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] Have you made time to do that latey?  EOS 0 0 10 I havent really no, should I?  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Definitely, exercise is a really good way to de-stress. It releases endorphins which can calm you and make you happy. This is a great way to reset before studying.  EOS 0 0 12 That is a good tip, I should really start working on that more. What could I do to help me study more efficiently though?  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] HAve you tried setting small study goals? That always helps me. I set a hour for one small topic at a time , it makes studying less overwhelming.  EOS 0 0 14 Okay, so If i have 6 finals, would I be able to study for all by studying less?  EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Not necessarily studying less but break the 6 finals into smaller tasks. Use index cards to organize yourself. I alwyas start with an outline of topics i need to cover then put them onto index cards. 
[reference_response]	not necessarily studying less but break the 6 finals into smaller tasks. use index cards to organize yourself. i alwyas start with an outline of topics i need to cover then put them onto index cards.

[contxt]	0 0 8 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it's online and basically I do things on my own time.  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses?  EOS 0 0 10 2 courses  EOS 0 0 11 but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them  EOS 0 0 12 devoting full-time I mean  EOS 0 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] do you like doing school online better than in person?  EOS 0 0 14 Have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one  EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good the more time you have to devote the better!  EOS 0 0 16 I have done both methods. I definitely prefer in-school studies.  EOS 0 1 17 [Question] Do you feel it is more stressful online?  EOS 0 0 18 I am just disappointed that I have been slacking off and procrastinating  EOS 0 0 19 no it's just that it's a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it's because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow.  EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after.  EOS 0 0 21 yeah I take breaks in between.  EOS 0 1 22 [Self-disclosure] Yea this pandemic has me not as motivated to  EOS 0 0 23 But sometimes a lot more breaks or longer breaks than intended or I should  EOS 0 0 24 yeah definitely. Sorry to hear that.  EOS 0 0 25 It's like everyday is the same and I can't go out to refresh my mind or have a change of pace such as going to the gym or go out for a run  EOS 0 0 26 whereas before the pandemic, I can switch gears that way and come back refreshed  EOS 0 0 27 like going out to the movies and coming back with renewed enthusiasm  EOS 0 1 28 [Self-disclosure] Yea i have been missing the gym myself. Now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them, and it really helps to get me going in the day.  EOS 0 1 29 [Providing Suggestions] Do you ever listen to music while you are trying to get work done? When i do that it tends to help time go faster and i get more done.  EOS 0 0 30 I see. Yeah it's good to have a routine and good way to resume life as usual.  EOS 0 0 31 sometimes I listen to music but I find it hard to read and absorb and listen to music. But I do listen to music sometimes when I am on assignments.  EOS 0 0 32 I also tend to drink coffee to focus my mind better. It does help.  EOS 0 0 33 And I know I can pass the courses and on time but just that I am disappointed at my performance and work ethics as I know I have done much better before. So I am missing that sense of urgency, conscientiousness, and maturity. ,  EOS 0 1 34 [Providing Suggestions] maybe find a nice meditation song to help relax you, i find when i am doing something finding a song with no words is better so i am able to concentrate.  EOS 0 0 35 I see. That's a good idea.  EOS 0 0 36 I was also thinking I should have a regular workout routine at home again because I used to work out much more daily, even at home.  EOS 0 1 37 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are a very smart person and are able to acknowledge when you need to work harder on something. Don't be to hard on yourself this pandemic is affecting everyone  EOS 0 0 38 working out does help me focus and be productive.  EOS 0 0 39 Thank you and I do agree with you on the pandemic. But this is a part of my mistake too but I think coming away from our conversation, I am more optimistic now having talked to someone about it.  EOS 0 1 40 [Self-disclosure] Yes i would imagine that would help to, i found that before i started working out at home i was beginning to feel lazy and not getting anything done, but that has all changed now. 
[reference_response]	yes i would imagine that would help to, i found that before i started working out at home i was beginning to feel lazy and not getting anything done, but that has all changed now.
[hypothesis_response]	that'sn't a problem.

EOS 4 0 6 I had a fear of losing job  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] What is causing this fear?  EOS 4 0 8 During this pandemic situation, most of the companies laid off their employees.  EOS 4 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Just from these few messages, I can tell you are very anxious about this situation.  EOS 4 0 10 Yes. I don't know what to do.  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Have you spoken with your supervisor about how you feel? Often times it helps to make sure your supervisor is aware of your concerns.  EOS 4 0 12 No. I just got the information from the company and didn't speak with anyone.  EOS 4 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I can definitely understand this feeling, as I was also very worried at the beginning of the pandemic about my job security.  EOS 4 0 14 Yes. I planned for many more things. But now I am losing my job.  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Another thing that really helped me was to take more time in the various hobbies I enjoy outside of work.  EOS 4 0 16 Yes. I should concentrate on another things  EOS 4 1 17 [Others] I found it very useful! 
[reference_response]	i found it very useful!

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hi, how are you?  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I'm good, How are you?  EOS 3 0 3 With COVID-19, I am worried I am not getitng to see my friends enough.  EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I'm sorry to hear that. Is that causing stress for you?  EOS 3 0 5 A little. I'm pretty introverted so I didn't think it was bothering me but I am starting to get impatient and short with my family.  EOS 3 0 6 It also might be remote learning and that stress.  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Times are very tough right now. It's pretty crazy how covid has impacted everything.  EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you interact with your friends at all now?  EOS 3 0 9 I do a little bit. Mostly by text and we zoom about once a week. How do you handle this?  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I've been struggling too, not being able to see my friends. I've been forcing myself to text them more or do phone calls or meet in person.  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I spend so much time on my computer with work now that I try to avoid video calls.  EOS 3 1 12 [Question] have you met them in person since covid started?  EOS 3 0 13 That's what I have been doing too. I tried to get together with my friends but we have little kids and that is tough. We don't want to get sick. I worry that we are drifting apart too.  EOS 3 0 14 We have a few times, outside and socially distanced. It has been nice but I want more time with them.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] That makes it hard. Have you talked to your friends about how they are feeling? Is there maybe some compromises you can make to see them more but keep distancing?  EOS 3 0 16 I haven't talked with them. They are busy and we haven't talked in a while. I need to call them.  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] You should give them a call. Just out of the blue, nothing commuting. Just a casual chat and see if they want to do something. If finding something to do doesn't work out during the call, at least you contacted them and maybe will feel a bit better because you talked to them. 
[reference_response]	you should give them a call. just out of the blue, nothing commuting. just a casual chat and see if they want to do something. if finding something to do doesn't work out during the call, at least you contacted them and maybe will feel a bit better because you talked to them.

[contxt]	2 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know it's tough, but I believe that if we all keep working together and talking through our feelings, we can make it through this!  EOS 2 0 10 But when i see social media and News every day it increasing my stress level  EOS 2 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I live alone as well and also need to take care of myself. It can be so hard at times.  EOS 2 1 12 [Information] I found that spending less time on social media and less time watching the news has helped my anxiety level to an extent. I don't think you should completely stop listening to what's going on as it's important to stay informed, but for me, limiting the amount of time that I spend engaging in these activities really helped.  EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about limiting how much time you spend tuning into news sources and especially on social media? I know it's hard because there isn't much to do.  EOS 2 0 14 yes but what can i do if am not spending time on it  EOS 2 0 15 there is not much option now i can't go out also  EOS 2 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered spending your time engaging in other hobbies? I've been doing a lot of arts and crafts (one in particular called diamond painting that can be ordered directly from Amazon) and also reading novels that I can also have delivered right to my door. This also prevents me from having to go out in public.  EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Talking to me about how you're feeling is a great start! I'm proud of you for being open and honest about what's going on in your head. It's very easy for people to get stuck inside of their own minds right now.  EOS 2 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Another suggestion I've been mentioning to others suffering from the mental stressors that COVID-19 is causing is considering speaking to an outpatient/occupational therapist. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?  EOS 2 0 19 Thanks that was good idea better keep away myself from social media for a while  EOS 2 0 20 thanks for your support  EOS 2 1 21 [Others] You're welcome! I'm more than happy to provide any help that I can. I'd also very highly recommend finding hobbies that you enjoy, even if arts and crafts or reading aren't your thing. Can you think of anything else that would help you to keep your mind off everything going on?  EOS 2 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] I've also found that guided meditation (you can find a lot of these for free on YouTube) helps to calm my mind down at night and allows me to get a really good night's sleep.  EOS 2 0 23 thanks  EOS 2 1 24 [Others] You're very welcome! I hope that some of the things that I suggested help you to get through all of this.  EOS 2 1 25 [Reflection of feelings] It seems as though you're feeling very similar to how I've been feeling.  EOS 2 0 26 yes  EOS 2 1 27 [Others] How has the weather been where you are? Sometimes, just getting outside for a brief walk alone or even just for a few minutes to get some fresh air can really be helpful.  EOS 2 0 28 sanjose  EOS 2 1 29 [Information] I found a few months ago that the more time I spent watching the news and following COVID-19, the more depressed and anxious I got. I decided that I'd spend 30 minutes twice per week catching up on what's going on in my local area and around the globe. Other than that, I try not to focus on it as much as I can.  EOS 2 1 30 [Others] Wow, it must be beautiful there! I'm in Pennsylvania.

EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] have you tried to take your mind off of the pandemic by spending time on your hobbies?  EOS 4 0 7 I have but they aren't the same without my friends  EOS 4 1 8 [Information] that's true. times like these really show us the value of our friends. have you talked to your friends recently? either in person or through phone/video calls?  EOS 4 0 9 We have done a few video calls but it just makes me more sad that I can't see them in person  EOS 4 1 10 [Information] okay. at lease seeing them in the video should have brought you some relief. Are you planning to get vaccinated when you are able to? And what about your friends? once you are vaccinated, it will help you meet your friends in person.  EOS 4 0 11 Yes we are planning to get it as soon as possible but that is hard in our state  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] oh okay. Have you tried checking with your friends to see if you could meet in person but still maintain social distance and wear masks, etc.  EOS 4 0 13 None of them are really comfortable with that sadly  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] oh okay, have you discussed anything with your friends to see if you find any alternative way of meeting?  EOS 4 0 15 I have tried but we don't have many ideas  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] okay. May i ask what do you do for a living? are there ways you can spend time on activities that you like so that it could reduce your sadness?  EOS 4 0 17 I am just a student right now. All of my classes are online  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] oh okay  EOS 4 0 19 I think things will get better eventually  EOS 4 1 20 [Information] do you like any subjects in particular?

EOS 2 0 3 I've made an accident at work in the warehouse 2 days ago and didn't report it. I have fear and anxiety that if management will find out I will get in trouble  EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Why didn't you report it?  EOS 2 0 5 I don't know now, I've just started there 1 month ago and probably I thought I will lose my job straight away  EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] You should report it because at least the boss knows that you are honest with your actions.  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don't think you won't lose it straight away if it is your first mistake  EOS 2 0 8 Yes I know and I regret it now, but I think to go report now it's too late  EOS 2 1 9 [Others] It's never too late, and it would be better to do it now than let him find out himself :)  EOS 2 0 10 On a training they told that need to report any accident straight away and if delay it will result in losing job for sure  EOS 2 0 11 I know I did wrong and it bothers me as I don't want to lose my job  EOS 2 1 12 [Others] Yes but if you report it now you still have a chance of being let off, but if u don't report it now, you would almost certainly lose your job.  EOS 2 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] In any case, always prepare for the worst circumstance at this point  EOS 2 0 14 But also there is a chance they will not find out?  EOS 2 1 15 [Information] They most likely will, so it is better not to use that chance 
[reference_response]	they most likely will, so it is better not to use that chance

EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Is it for work or for school?  EOS 0 0 4 This presentation is for school  EOS 0 0 5 I am indeed worried about public speaking  EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I actually majored in communication and have a great deal of experience with public speaking.  EOS 0 0 7 That's interesting, I find public speaking to be especially difficult  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Yes, the physical nervousness that can manifest is powerful. I would highly recommend finding a quiet place to calm and focus your mind for at least five minutes before your presentation. At least a minute's worth of breathing, and drink plenty of water.  EOS 0 0 9 That very helpful advice, I think another stressful factor is being able to field questions effectively  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Ah, yes, that is a hard one. You are expected to be an expert. But you can only prepare so much.  EOS 0 0 11 Agreed, and there is always that fear that you won't know an answer  EOS 0 1 12 [Others] "That is a really great question that I've never considered! Maybe XYZ? I can check on that and get back to you with a sure answer though!"  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] There's no shame in being able to say that you understand why someone would ask the question(whatever it may be) but that you don't have a full or even partial answer right now.  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Because you're also going to get like, the hecklers and the people who want to look intelligent by asking asinine questions  EOS 0 0 15 I can understand that, as a I try to prepare for the presentation it's stressing me out about all of the different types of potential questions.  EOS 0 0 16 But the advice you gave is very good  EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] Just feel confident that you have fulfilled the assignment according to the guidelines.

EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i can totally relate to that, I am feeling the same way  EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long have you been feeling this way?  EOS 4 0 4 I don't know what to do with myself. A year. I haven't left my house once.  EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] so it sounds like you are feeling cooped up and not knowing what to do, am i right?  EOS 4 0 6 Yes, it's more than that.  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] can you tell me more?  EOS 4 0 8 I'm in this house, and scared. Nothing is getting better for me or anyone else I know.  EOS 4 1 9 [Question] may I ask where you are located?  EOS 4 0 10 In Mass.  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it's normal to feel scared. Of course it being normal doesn't make it any better...  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] can you get out for walks?  EOS 4 0 13 I live in such a populous area, I am afraid to. Especially with warmer temperatures coming.  EOS 4 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i see. are you saying your sidewalks are too busy to be able to social distance properly?  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] i find getting out for walks is helpful. i live downtown in a small city. i wear a mask while I walk and veer onto the grass, into the bike lane or whatnot if someone comes...or I look ahead and cross the street if it's convenient...that makes me feel safer when i walk. i have a medical condition too.  EOS 4 0 16 I just wish I could do that.  EOS 4 1 17 [Question] what is it that is stopping you, are the sidewalks too crowded?  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] without my walks I'd go crazy...it's my daily stress reliever....i am at home 23 hours a day  EOS 4 1 19 [Question] are you planning to get a vaccine and if so do you know how long you have to wait?

[contxt]	1 0 1 Hello. I recently broke up with my boyfriend. We'd were together for 5 years.  EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am so sorry to hear that. That can be a really hard time and problem to navigate. Five years is a really long time too.  EOS 1 0 3 It was unexpected and sudden. I found out he was cheating on me.  EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a horrible shock to hear something like that. I thank you for expressing yourself today it can be hard to share a disappointment.  EOS 1 0 5 I am really strict about lies and he broke my trust, so I felt like I had to break-up with him.  EOS 1 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have good instincts when you can face a situation and make a judgment and decision.  EOS 1 0 7 I feel like that's true but I miss him so much. Five years is a lot to just throw away.  EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, you can feel like you have invested a lot after 5 years. I can imagine you have a lot of the same friends and that can be hard too.  EOS 1 0 9 We also have two dogs and own a house together. I just don't know what to do.  EOS 1 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I can relate to on that level. When I went through a divorce I had to part with my house and pets. I went to live in an apartment and met a really nice guy next door and wound up marrying him. There can be light at the end of the tunnel.  EOS 1 0 11 I guess... I'm just not sure how to get to the light from where I am right now. I'm just so angry.  EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Being anger is valid and you have every right to be mad. You have been betrayed and have to work through problems that you didn't create. Do you have any close friends you can confide in sometimes?  EOS 1 0 13 I do, her name is Ann-Marie and she's wonderful.  EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That is fortunate and reflects what a good person that you are to have developed a close friend that you can trust. Maybe she could be your support when the evening and weekends get hard for you?  EOS 1 0 15 That's a wonderful idea. I will definitely do that.  EOS 1 1 16 [Information] If you are interested in religion often times they have local support groups to join as well. 
[reference_response]	if you are interested in religion often times they have local support groups to join as well.
[hypothesis_response]	i think that you should be able to trust your friends. it can make things a lot easier.

I support whatever she wants but right after Christmas is hard  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Holidays can add pressure to our "normal" situations.  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Did you find that your normal coping mechanisms were not as helpful today?  EOS 3 0 6 Yeah, December has been hard on everyone. I know things will get better but its hard finding positivity when I feel so negative.  EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sounds like your support is not appreciated. 
[reference_response]	sounds like your support is not appreciated.
[hypothesis_response]	i understand. i have experienced that too. what i have found to help me to cope with my negative mood is to just take a deep breath and let it go. it helps me to relax and make sure i am doing my best to get through the day.

[contxt]	6 0 0 Hello, how are you?  EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling?  EOS 6 0 2 I'm alright, honestly I'm feeling rather ashamed. The reason for that and the problem that I'm facing is that I've had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and I'm only 24 years old. Right now in my life I'm ready to seek help, but I'm having a lot of anxiety about it because I'm very worried about how others will judge me. I'm worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I'm ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I've made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help.  EOS 6 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am in a good position to help you as I am in the same situation. Please know you are not alone.  EOS 6 1 4 [Providing Suggestions] I would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later!  EOS 6 1 5 [Question] Hello? Are you wanting to talk?  EOS 6 0 6 Yes of course I didn't hear it go off, my apologies. I really appreciate that, it really is helpful knowing that I'm not the only one who feels this way  EOS 6 0 7 I really know that that's what I need to do, and I am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know  EOS 6 1 8 [Question] What level of alcohol consumption do you have?

Everyone there will be in the same place  EOS 6 1 11 [Information] And the longer you keep drinking the more damage you are doing to yourself  EOS 6 0 12 and quite a bit, about half a gallon or more a day . And thank you, I really do appreciate your help. I know that and I know its time for me to better my life because its no way to live ya know.

[situation]	I was in a relationship with someone that took 5 years. We were planning on building a home together and he liked the idea and promised we would pull through together. I loved him so much that I would literary do nothing to heart his feeling. We built friendship for years and we had something beautiful and close to perfection. As time went on, I did not know what went wrong but he started showing disinterest in matters that concerns me . When it started we had the conversation. I was worried and he assured me nothing was wrong. I later found out with a great dismay that he was going out with one of our high school acquaintances . It really hurt the more when he told me what I thought we had was over. it shattered me emotional. He went from avoiding my calls to not wanting to see me around. it hurts me badly. As I recall this am feeling emotional because tit was a terrible period for me.

Hard to pull off during the pandemic though.  EOS 1 1 26 [Self-disclosure] To be honest, watching porn is normal, however, I feel that if someone is too into it, as in watch it more than 1-2 times a month, it's problematic and won't be easy to fix  EOS 1 1 27 [Question] Do you live with him?  EOS 1 0 28 Ah. I think it's more of a real issue when it comes to controlling himself or using sites because he was single for so long. He is currently staying with me.

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hey  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] HI, can I help today?  EOS 0 0 2 I have been married for 5 years but i am very unhappy and anxious. I want to break up with my partner but not sure how, this is increasing my anxiety  EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that. I know it can be really stressful when you are considering a break up. How long have you thought about doing this?  EOS 0 0 4 i've thought about this for the last year, things have been going downhill since. I think its starting to become noticible  EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That is a long time to think about something, so you have given it a lot of time and thought. Have you mentioned it to your partner?  EOS 0 0 6 i tried to do it around 8 months ago but my partner convinced herself that it was because i was cheating on her. Her own insecurities put me under a lot of pressure to stay in the relationship to prove i wasn't having an affair  EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sharing your feelings is important so thank you for making the effort today. It is not fair to prove a negative and that can be taxing. It sounds like you are a very patient person.  EOS 0 0 8 I try to be patient, but i feel like i am wasting my life when i could be happy on my own or potentially with someone else in the future  EOS 0 0 9 Im anxious about my daughter and my relationship with her if we split up  EOS 0 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] You have spent a great deal of time trying to make things right with your partner and you have used a great deal of effort to make it work. You are also a very loving parent who cares greatly.  EOS 0 0 11 I know i need to be true to myself but its extremely difficult, i'm not sure how to start the process  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Yes, you are right. My parents split up later in life and I was happy to see my dad happy. I understand that isn't everyone story though. Do you have any close family members you can talk to about this? Or close friends?  EOS 0 0 13 unfortunately i pushed all my friends away for the sake of the relationship, again the insecurities meant i couldn't have my own time and space. I know my family would be supportive, but there are a lot of financial issues with divorce which worries me  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Often times people turn to church or religion and support groups in order to connect with people from the same faith. Have you considered this avenue?  EOS 0 0 15 Ive considered support groups, im a little embarrassed tho. I don't think religion would be much help to me  EOS 0 1 16 [Information] I understand that you feel nervous about reaching out and thank you again for doing that here today. Sometimes close friends can be a good source of support. It can be hard repairing friendships though.  EOS 0 0 17 Maybe i should reach out again?  EOS 0 1 18 [Information] Yes, I would reach out to old friends who may be willing to give you insight into how they viewed things. Support groups can feel intimidating but are usually very welcoming and truly there to help people. 
[reference_response]	yes, i would reach out to old friends who may be willing to give you insight into how they viewed things. support groups can feel intimidating but are usually very welcoming and truly there to help people.
[hypothesis_response]	i would definitely reach out to those you care about and that you are still feeling down about.

EOS 4 1 7 [Question] What kind of help, if I may ask?  EOS 4 0 8 She wanted me to take her for the shopping and I was busy that day.  EOS 4 0 9 She thought I was making excuses  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I completely understand your frustration. Sometime work life balance is overwhelming.

EOS 4 0 13 yes, but still she thinks that I was making excuses that day. She is not ready to listen.  EOS 4 1 14 [Information] Experts says that when someone get emotional waiting some time might help reduce the tension.  EOS 4 0 15 You mean should I give her time?  EOS 4 1 16 [Information] That is correct. After some time, when emotion is down, you both can have a discussion about the incident.  EOS 4 0 17 We have been friends since childhood. For this reason I don't want to loose her. I will try your suggestion. Thanks  EOS 4 1 18 [Question] Thank you. Anything else I could help you with?

EOS 1 0 18 it doesnt matter they still keep open communication with each other  EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's no good what do you think the problem is?

EOS 1 0 22 no anything i owe i always pay back  EOS 1 0 23 perhaps they are tired of being asked  EOS 1 1 24 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That can get in the way of a friendship sometimes, but I try not to get ahead of myself and jump the gun. They may have lost a phone or something may have come up...  EOS 1 1 25 [Reflection of feelings] That very well could be... Are you working?  EOS 1 0 26 no im not currently  EOS 1 0 27 I also think sometimes to myself that they don't answer because they think I'm asking for money  EOS 1 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see, Have you tried for unemployment?  EOS 1 0 29 yes i dont qualify  EOS 1 1 30 [Providing Suggestions] I understand that. What if that is the case? You may need to talk to them and let them know how you feel about that.

[contxt]	1 1 3 [Question] It sounds like you might be upset. Can you tell me what’s going on?  EOS 1 0 4 My ex partner and I broke up a long time ago because they cheated on me. Now they will not stop contacting my friends and family and posting about me on social media  EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That sounds difficult and stressful. What do you do when you see it happening?  EOS 1 0 6 I usually just document it and try to not go online for a while. It is hard to ignore  EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are avoiding things you enjoy because of their actions. I think documenting it is a good idea! Have you tried reporting them for harassing you?  EOS 1 0 8 I have tried but everyone just tells me there is nothing they can do because they don't think it is dangerous or criminal at this point  EOS 1 1 9 [Question] That must be very frustrating. Can you tell me if you’ve tried other things to get them to stop?  EOS 1 0 10 I have confronted them in person but it was dramatic to say the least. They basically had a meltdown that they don't want to lose me  EOS 1 1 11 [Self-disclosure] You tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions?  EOS 1 0 12 I have encouraged my friends to block them as well, but a new account always pops up. My ex really will not give up.  EOS 1 1 13 [Question] I see. How long has this been going on and is this a daily occurrence or does it happen at certain times?  EOS 1 0 14 It has been happening for at least 6 months now and it usually happens every weekend  EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I can sense your frustration. It must be overwhelming at times and make you dread the weekends. It sounds like it has become a habit for your ex. It might help if you write a letter to them explaining that you are ready to move on and are asking them to do the same. Explain that you are giving them the opportunity to stop harassing you in the following ways [list some of the details you have documented]. Inform them that if they do not stop, you are considering taking it further regarding harassing communications and that this letter serves as your intention to no longer tolerate their actions. Send it via certified mail and keep a copy. This will give them no way to immediately respond and would be the first step of official documentation should they decide to continue. Do you think that might help?  EOS 1 0 16 I think that is an excellent idea! That is a good way to end this once and for all.  EOS 1 1 17 [Others] I sincerely hope it is a step toward you regaining your control over how you are able to interact with people. I wish you the best in dealing with this and hope you begin to feel better about it soon, especially entering into a new year! 
[reference_response]	i sincerely hope it is a step toward you regaining your control over how you are able to interact with people. i wish you the best in dealing with this and hope you begin to feel better about it soon, especially entering into a new year!

[contxt]	3 1 2 [Question] I'm sorry to hear that. What is causing you these feelings?  EOS 3 0 3 Since helping to raise my grandson and his dad is not helping, or cares how I am feeling. My grandson has been really difficult lately and I find myself losing my temper quickly .  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds like a difficult situation. Have you tried any personal exercises to help you cope with the situation until you find a resolution?  EOS 3 0 5 I do go to a quiet place and try some deep breathing, but my grandson always comes walking in  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] That's certainly a difficult situation. Is there no resolution possible with the father of your grandson? I want to make sure that th e cause of the depression has properly been addressed by you or someone else.  EOS 3 0 7 I try talking to him, but due to my grandson having some disabilities his dad does not really want to be bothered. I just want my grandson to succeed and be the best he can be  EOS 3 1 8 [Question] I think it's great that you have such care and concern for your grandson. That shows how incredible you are and on behalf of your grandson, I think you are doing a tremendous job. I think you should continue to support him however you can, but it's also important to take care of yourself. Do you have time available for additional self care, or are there any new exercises you can try to try to take care of yourself?  EOS 3 0 9 Thank you for saying that it means alot having someone tell me I am doing a good job. I recently purchased a hot tub and have been thinking that maybe when he goes to bed I could go out and relax, but have not done that yet  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] That sounds like a great start. Self care is vitally important in this difficulty time with COVID and the pandemic. I recommend any little bit of time that you can contribute to yourself, this includes reading, relaxing, meditating, exercise, or just resting. Anything that can help you repair so you are better prepared to help your grandson.  EOS 3 0 11 I will try my best to get more time for myself and try to relax more often that I currently am.  EOS 3 0 12 I am also trying to accept that my medical issues are getting worse and I can not do all that I use to, and that truly frustrates me as well.  EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Do you think the anger you are feeling is directly a result of the situation? Do you feel the anger is manifested from somewhere else? I think it is important to get to the underlying source of the anger and take care of that first and foremost.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That's concerning, but very understandable. Are you able to financially seek additional help? Sometimes it's just what you need, as hard or embarrassing as that may seem. No one needs to know what you seek, but it is important not to disregard additional help, be it mental health, physical therapy, or just general prevention and detection from a PCP.

EOS 3 0 4 I work a dead end job with no potential and it is depressing being there for 9 hours a day. Thats why I am on here instead of working.  EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That sounds really exhausting. You work longer hours than a normal job and must feel really burned out.  EOS 3 0 6 Yeah the burn out isn't the worst I experienced. I previously worked jobs that I was at for 12 hours a day but they were more rewarding.  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are definitely a hard worker and I hope you know that. You make a great employee puttin in som many hours.

[contxt]	0 0 8 Yes exactly  EOS 0 0 9 I need help balancing it all out  EOS 0 0 10 And saying no at work while still progressing in my career  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] Have you considered any kind of counselling to talk through these feelings? There are some organisations around that will offer help for free  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps honestly talking things through with your partner would really help you both too.  EOS 0 0 13 I don’t have time for thst  EOS 0 0 14 Or feel that I don’t have time for it  EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you saying that you are putting your work ahead of everything else in your life, is that correct?  EOS 0 0 16 Yes I do think with my partner would help.  EOS 0 0 17 Yes that is correct but my job supports all the bills.  EOS 0 1 18 [Others] Nonetheless, there is no need to make it the entire focus of your life, especially if it is impacting on other aspects of it.  EOS 0 0 19 Yes but I guess I’m trying to find that balance and struggling  EOS 0 1 20 [Question] Do you feel that you have to hit unrealistic goals and meet unrealistic expectations?  EOS 0 0 21 Oh yes all the timr  EOS 0 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I personally sometimes find it difficult not to be too hard on myself. Sometimes I have to remind myself to relax and have fun once in a while.  EOS 0 0 23 Yes I would agree with you there. It feels harder to escape and have a fun night right now  EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] It has been a very hard year for everyone, I know and I sympathise.

EOS 0 0 25 Get together with friends and explore a new restaurant  EOS 0 0 26 Which isn’t possible yet  EOS 0 1 27 [Others] That sounds like a really fun thing to do! Can you plan one evening soon where you and your friends will do this and you will promise yourself that you won't cancel in favour of work?  EOS 0 0 28 The issue is I can’t with covid  EOS 0 1 29 [Question] Ah yes that is a big problem. Are restaurants closed where you are?  EOS 0 1 30 [Providing Suggestions] What about getting together with just a couple of friends for a picnic?  EOS 0 0 31 I like that idea but it’s 30 here. Maybe something like that or a walk with some spiked drinks  EOS 0 1 32 [Others] I think that the important thing is to get out of the office and have some human contact. I do agree that it's a really miserable time of year for it though  EOS 0 0 33 Yes. Human contact and ideally in person would so help  EOS 0 1 34 [Question] I hope I have been able to give you a little perspective on your problems! Is there something else you'd like to talk to me about today?  EOS 0 0 35 I think you have helped step back. Sometimes when you are in the middle of it you can’t find a way out.

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? I am feeling rather sad.  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hi there. Yes, What is making you sad?  EOS 0 0 2 I feel that my friends do not like me very much any more. Apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me.  EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities.  EOS 0 0 4 Do you think that I am over-reacting? I do not want to sound over sensitive but this has been happening for a while.  EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Have you talked with your friends on how you feel? When was the last time you all connected?  EOS 0 0 6 We went out for coffee the other day and I thought about saying something cos I know they went to a club without me last weekend but I couldn't bring myself to in the end.  EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you, especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee. I'm sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club.  EOS 0 0 8 Sometimes in the past I have turned down invitations to go out clubbing, admittedly. Could it be that they just did not think that I wanted to go?  EOS 0 1 9 [Information] From what I have experienced personally, I am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends. After turning them down a few times, they stopped inviting as well. I think they thought that was not my thing.  EOS 0 0 10 The thing is though that this is not the only thing - they have been to rock concerts without me too. I just feel I am no longer a part of the group.  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I feel how this is hurting you. The best thing would be to talk to them about feeling disinvited to group activities. Let them know you are still free and really want to spend some time together. Do you think you can open up to them on whats bothering you?  EOS 0 0 12 I don't know. I don't want to come across as just being paranoid or whiny. Sometimes I think it would be better to just forget them and not have any friends.  EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like this situation is really bothering you. Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated. The bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation. If they don't know what is bothering you, it will be harder to mend the relationship.  EOS 0 0 14 It is making me really depressed and is badly damaging my sense of self worth. I feel as though I am not worth anyone's time.  EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] You are worth every precious second of time and should not let this diminish your self worth. Find common ground, an activity you all enjoy and invite them to hang with you.  EOS 0 0 16 Thank you that is helpful. What if I reach out and they all snub me though?  EOS 0 1 17 [Information] We all have busy hectic lives at time. True friends make time to be with one another. This world is full of beautiful people to bond with. Keeping a closed circle of friends is a blessing.

[contxt]	3 0 0 I could not sleep at night.  EOS 3 1 1 [Question] That is unfortunate to hear; is this a usual difficulty at night?  EOS 3 0 2 Yes. At all nights I feel insecured  EOS 3 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It is most uncomfortable when you cannot feel secure in your bed for sleep.  EOS 3 0 4 Yes. I feel like there is no one for me. I think I need some support.  EOS 3 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Some nights I have suffered from feeling as you describe.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Have you discussed this with anyone you feel close with?  EOS 3 0 7 No I feel ashamed to discuss my problem. What did you did in your situation?  EOS 3 1 8 [Information] In my situation, I met a small pet dog I became close with; he does not like to sleep alone either, so we are now close and keep each other company at night to sleep.  EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Do you think a small pet would be of any comfort to your situation?  EOS 3 0 10 That is a good idea but I don't like dogs.  EOS 3 0 11 I think I may try it with cats or fishes. What do you think about it?  EOS 3 1 12 [Others] I understand everyone has their preference about pets or animals.  EOS 3 0 13 Yeah Thank you for understanding me. I thought no one understands me.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] A cat is a sweet companion and also like to sleep comfortable with people at night.  EOS 3 0 15 Yes now I decided to buy a cat. And I think my problems will be sorted after the cat comes.  EOS 3 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] I feel alone sometime as well, so do not feel misunderstood. I believe it may be natural for us to feel this way from time to time.  EOS 3 0 17 Yes That may be true. But my problems are disturbing my sleep.  EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Hopefully, having a new friend who also enjoys sleeping will assist you with this particular disrbance.  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] Hopefully, having a new friend who also enjoys sleeping will assist you with this particular disrbance.

Things are scattered and disorganized.

I feel like my life is no use  EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You should never feel like your life is no use because it is you have a lot to live for  EOS 3 1 16 [Information] you have to control those negative thoughts and replace them with positive thoughts i know it is hard but believe me you will feel better  EOS 3 0 17 I tried to stay positive but these negative thoughts are always stuck in my head despite of trying to not think about it.

[contxt]	3 0 0 HI, I need help, I have been feeling very down lately.  EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Okay, how can I help you?  EOS 3 0 2 I just wanted to talk to someone.  EOS 3 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Is there anything particular that has got you feeling down lately?  EOS 3 0 4 I feel like I am in a rut.  EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Its always good to have someone to talk to, I am happy to help. I have felt stuck many times, so i can understand that.  EOS 3 0 6 What did you do to get out of the rut.  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Well I had to sit down and think about why I was stuck and tried to come up with as many options as I could to be unstuck, then i put them in order based on which I thought would work best. It took quite a few of them, but I did finally get unstuck.  EOS 3 0 8 I can try doing that.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Every one is different, but it is worth a shot, might help the rut your having, might also give you new ideas that will help you decide on how to not feel like your in a rut anymore. Sometimes just talking to someone can help too, bouncing ideas off of each other can help in some cases.  EOS 3 0 10 True, I have been avoiding most people.  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Its hard to talk about certain problems, so I can't blame you, however you can get some good ideas from others. You might have just needed some space to evaluate your situation, nothing wrong with taking a break from things or people if it helps you.  EOS 3 0 12 I will try reaching out to my sister tomorrow. maybe she can help.  EOS 3 0 13 I also feel embarrassed that I feel so unhappy.  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] From chatting with you I can tell you might be ready to start talking and maybe get some help or advice, family is a great start they are typically a great support system. It is okay to feel embarrassed but being unhappy will eat at you, sometimes its good to set our pride aside so that we can figure things out. In my situation of feeling stuck I was ashamed that I sat and let people treat me so badly but it wasn't until I seen it as a problem that I started making my lists and getting advice. Some things we do on our own and some its good to have people to help. I think reaching out to your sister would be worth a try, she might also have different ideas and suggestions you haven' t thought of yet.  EOS 3 0 15 Thanks, you have been a lot of help.  EOS 3 1 16 [Others] Thank you for chatting with me, I am glad to help. I hope you have a great day! Stay positive!  EOS 3 0 17 I will try and you have a nice day too.  EOS 3 0 18 Bye  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] If you need to chat again I would be glad to talk to you, I think you will do great at fixing your rut. Thank you.

[contxt]	4 0 1 I've been dealing with a lot of depression lately. not sure how to shake it (1)  EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Im sorry to hear that, has there been anything going to cause the increase?  EOS 4 0 3 My daughter was born about 3 months ago. I guess it's post-partum.(2)  EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is really rough, though it is good you recognize it. A lot of people do not.  EOS 4 0 5 Well I figured when I was crying at the Pampers commercial that there might be an issue (3)  EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried to talk to a professional. It is very prevalent that mothers experiencing this do.  EOS 4 0 7 I've talked to my doctor that delivered my daughter about it. He recommended medication but I'm not so sure I want to take something for the rest of my life (4)  EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] As long as you recognize that it is a much more common thing that people go through, that is a great start. I experienced it with my second child as well.  EOS 4 0 9 Did they put you on medication (5)  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] There is no harm getting a second opinion. I never did take medication, i found a good therapist to talk too.  EOS 4 0 11 A second opinion is probably a good thing. I just know I can't keep laying in bed 1/2 the day with the baby. (6)  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Yeah that you cant, and i cant stress how good it is that you realize it. I would definitely go for a second opinion. Or even search for therapists that specialize in it in your area. Never have been a fan of using medicine as the first go unless really needed.  EOS 4 0 13 Yeah, I'm not big on the medication. I've talked to several moms that went on it and years later had to stay on it because the withdrawals were so terrible. I'd like to be able to process through it(7)  EOS 4 1 14 [Question] And whats the worst a little talking can do for you. Has talking to other moms been helpful at all?  EOS 4 0 15 Well, some of them LOL! Others just scare me to pieces so it really depends on who it is! My husband does not understand at all but he's trying (8)  EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] At least he is trying, as i said before, even with it being so common, it is a mystery to most.

EOS 3 1 5 [Question] what made you feel this way?  EOS 3 0 6 The pressures of Covid and taking care of my disabled sister are just getting to me.  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i see how that could make you a bit anxious. I get the same way also.  EOS 3 0 8 Thanks. I'm just tired of the Covid restrictions. I can't wait for things to get back to normal.  EOS 3 1 9 [Others] i feel the same. being on lockdown could make anyone a little crazy  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] do you have family or friends that you could reach out to over the phone?  EOS 3 0 11 I do. My other sister is always a big help. Maybe I should text her more often?  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes! that would always be a good idea. its always comforting to hear from a loved one.  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] i myself yearn for a good call from family or even hearing someone close voice. always makes me smile.  EOS 3 0 14 That's true. I tend to stew on my thoughts.  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] hows the weather where you are?  EOS 3 0 16 It's not too bad. Cloudy and 40 which is pretty good for this time of year. How's your weather?  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] i live in the south . not cold yet. but your weather sounds like it would be nice for a lovely walk.  EOS 3 0 18 Exercise does always help. I walk/jog five miles every day. I generally feel my best right after that. Don't you find that true too?  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] yes! although i probably couldnt walk nor run 5 miles a day. i love getting out to enjoy nature. it always helps to keep mind off things. does that usually work for you?  EOS 3 0 20 Yes, I love nature but I live in a congested suburb. It would take me awhile to get out to the country. That's why Covid is so tough - I can't travel which is my main form of relaxation. What do you do to relax?  EOS 3 1 21 [Self-disclosure] i see, for me to relax. i find sitting back in my recliner reading a nice book always relaxes me. i also love yoga. its a refreshing relaxtion  EOS 3 0 22 I should try yoga. I sometimes do breathing exercises when I get really stressed. Maybe I should go back to it. What do you think?  EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] actually that would be a good idea. i find yoga and breathing deep help relieve stress & let go of the negative.  EOS 3 0 24 I think I'll try it. Thanks! It was good talking to you. I think we completed the requirements. Have a good Thanksgiving and stay safe out there. Bye!  EOS 3 1 25 [Others] you too always :-)

EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I would be happy to listen and help if I can :)  EOS 6 1 4 [Question] When did you notice you had a problem with alcohol?  EOS 6 0 5 The thing is I am drinking beer almost every day since I started to work from home. And with weather so nice in upcoming weeks I can't see myself stop drinking.  EOS 6 1 6 [Question] How many beer a day do you typically drink?  EOS 6 0 7 At least 4 pints. A lot of money goes on drinks as well.  EOS 6 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. So if I understand correctly, you are concerned because you are drinking more than you used to, more frequently, and you are afraid you cannot stop? And it's affecting you financially?  EOS 6 0 9 Yes, that's right. And I know I should stop but I just got addicted.  EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's really great that you have the insight to see that it may be a problem...that awareness is the most important first step!

EOS 0 1 8 [Information] Major pharma companies have already announced vaccines and they have a success rate of more than 90 -95%. So my friend, this too shall pass.  EOS 0 0 9 Yeah I've been reading those research articles recently they look promising  EOS 0 0 10 I'm hoping the vaccines get developed early next year and everyth ing can go back to normal  EOS 0 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] I feel the same way too! Modern technology is indistinguishable from magic!  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So hang in there, with the US election results and the vaccine announcement, things will surely get better.  EOS 0 0 13 Yeah it's looking like things will improve  EOS 0 1 14 [Information] If you are in North America, the pandemic rate will go high due to combination with flu season, but at the end of the day, we will develop herd immunity.  EOS 0 0 15 Yeah not looking forward to flu season  EOS 0 0 16 I wish people would just stop throwing parties and getting everyone sick  EOS 0 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Well, nobody is, my friend! But it's part of life. And ya, morons will exist all over the world.  EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Since you are young, even if you contract, you will recover pretty easily. But, God forbid, if you do, please practice social distancing and stay home!

[contxt]	2 0 1 Hello, I'm just having a tough couple of weeks in my marriage.  EOS 2 1 2 [Question] What seems to be going on in your marriage?  EOS 2 0 3 our main problem is communication. We cant talk about anything without one of us getting mad. Its become a habit  EOS 2 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand how you are feeling marriage is hard for some.  EOS 2 0 5 I need to find some free workshops or something. I think we would both be uncomfortable with therapy. I have looked but cant find any good cheap options.  EOS 2 1 6 [Others] Communication is key in a marriage  EOS 2 0 7 I think we are both willing to end it if we cant get along but both want to fix it but dont know where to start. We have lived together for 6 years but only recently gotten married.  EOS 2 0 8 Are you married?  EOS 2 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do not let this get the best of you. there are ups and downs in marriage but you have to be able to work through all that with your partner.  EOS 2 1 10 [Others] no i am not married but one day i do want to get married  EOS 2 0 11 My parents are going through a divorce right now. They were together for 25 years.. my dad has been my step dad since I was two. She went to rehab and they were planning to renew their vows when she got out. She left him for a guy she met in rehab.  EOS 2 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know you will two will be able to work through this together  EOS 2 0 13 Thanks  EOS 2 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear and i understand how you are feeling my parents recently got a divorce  EOS 2 0 15 Yeah i think its bothering me more than I realized.  EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] i can understand but you know you just have to move on with life and not let that get in the way especially your marriage  EOS 2 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] both of you need to try to sit down and have a talk about the marriage and let your partner know how you are feeling and see how your partner is feeling.  EOS 2 1 18 [Information] without communication then it will be hard to get through a marriage  EOS 2 0 19 youre right  EOS 2 1 20 [Information] when there is no communication then that is when the trouble starts and the marriage starts failing  EOS 2 0 21 We have. We cant talk about whats for dinner without an argument these days.  EOS 2 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] find the right time to talk to your partner and just explain to your feelings towards what is going on and let your partner know you do not like what is going on  EOS 2 0 23 You're right. Thanks for the advice.  EOS 2 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] if that does not help try to seek help from a marriage counselor i have heard they have saved many marriages from failing

[contxt]	4 0 0 hello  EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello, and how are you feeling today?  EOS 4 0 2 so am having a hard time with my friends excluding me in everything because of my religious stance  EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I have had a similar situation not long ago. It was hard, but once I told my friend it was bothering me, he changed his behavior.  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Hve you tried talking with your friend?  EOS 4 0 5 i did tell them but mostly say that they feel uncomfortable cause i dont drink and do all those things  EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's good that you stood your ground. For that you should be proud.  EOS 4 0 7 i hardly have friends and the two friends i have are treating me like am no longer one of them  EOS 4 1 8 [Question] Have you considered, being more active in your religious community? It could be a great place to make friends.  EOS 4 0 9 i am as active as i can be. they are friendly and supportive but right now they only ever socialize on church events or church. not really a friend i can confide in when facing hardship  EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It definitely takes time developing new friendships. Have your tired inviting someone from church to hang out, outside of church event?  EOS 4 0 11 no not really. I am trying to take time to at least get used to some in church first before anything  EOS 4 0 12 I wouldn't want an awkward silence when we are together.  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well that's great that you're taking those first steps. I believe that in due time those friendships will blossom. Patience is key.  EOS 4 0 14 but does it make me a bad person giving up on my childhood friendships  EOS 4 0 15 should i try harder to make them see what am doing  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] It also sounds to me like maybe you're over worrying. Have you considered seeing a movie where you wouldn't have to worry about awkward silence?  EOS 4 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes people just move on from one another. I personally wouldn't try to make these friends see what you are doing. I think you should focus on you, and look to the future. 
[reference_response]	sometimes people just move on from one another. i personally wouldn't try to make these friends see what you are doing. i think you should focus on you, and look to the future.

[contxt]	0 0 1 Hello  EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you doing today?  EOS 0 0 3 Okay. How are you?  EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Trying to be positive about the dumpster fire of 2020 lol, but positivity is kind of hard to maintain wouldn't you say?  EOS 0 0 5 It really, really is. Things just pile up, you know?  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Totally! It's hard to plan for success when life seems a bit uncertain. Is there anything in particular that's bothering you?  EOS 0 0 7 It's a combination of things. I have no idea what I'm doing most days, just kind of going through the motions. Kind of like Groundhog Day, repeating the same day over and over with slightly different variations. Trying to get things done and taken care of, thinking I'm doing my best and feeling like it's never good enough. Feeling like I'm failing all the time.  EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Ah yes, the cog in the machine sort of vibe. Boy do I feel that. Well, the good thing is your not alone. The bad thing is societal pressure demands that we be productive or we think we're wasting time. When's the last time you took a day to enjoy something you like to do?  EOS 0 0 9 It's been a long time since I did that, I can't even remember when  EOS 0 0 10 I don't get many opportunities like that.  EOS 0 1 11 [Question] What activity or activities are you thinking about? Anything that you enjoy or makes you smile.  EOS 0 0 12 Anything really. I have two kids, neither of which is in school yet so they're with me all the time. It's very rare that I have someone to watch them for me so I can do....anything by myself. One of my good friends got married recently and my parents watched them for me so I could go to her bachelorette party and wedding without them. That was the first time I'd gone anywhere without them in....over a year  EOS 0 1 13 [Question] Ah weddings, did you have fun?  EOS 0 0 14 I did. I had a really good time. It was weird being out without them, but it was fun  EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Nice! Well, two kids is A LOT, especially since they aren't in school yet. You are dealing with the care and growth of the most complex organism on this planet...times two! That's incredible. First of all, give yourself a pat on the back for that. Secondly, is it ok if i ask if you felt guilty for having fun without them? Often times guilt robs us of the ability to take care of ourselves, which happens to me all the time.

[contxt]	0 0 1 Hello, my name is Nicholas. I am feeling a bit tired today, how are you Carolyn?  EOS 0 1 2 [Others] I'm a bit tired too to be honest! Is there anything you'd like to talk about today? I'm ready to listen :)  EOS 0 0 3 I have been tired a lot lately, even when I sleep for 8 hours. I am not sure what to really do to help myself gain more energy and recover my sleeping schedule to normal.  EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I see. Are you finding it hard to function on not enough sleep? I have experienced that at times as well, and found it quite frustrating!  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] How much sleep are you getting now? Do you keep irregular sleep hours, e.g. the time you go to bed and get up?  EOS 0 0 6 Yes, I had a bad sleeping schedule, when I would go to sleep around 2-3am. I now get around 8 hours of sleep but I feel like it isn't enough still.  EOS 0 0 7 Would this relate to a health problem of not being active or maybe stress?  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I used to be a night owl, going to bed early in the morning. I reset my schedule very gradually. I went to bed 15 minutes earlier, and set an alarm for 8 hours later. I did that for 3 days, then I would ratchet it back another 15 minutes. It was a gradual process and the only way I could fix it.

[situation]	It started during my childhood, when I was 9 years old, living my father. He had a bad temper and was impatient with me, especially with school. He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes. After the age of 10, I ended up living with my mother but I would spend most of my time with my friends because I enjoyed their company more than anything. I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well. Today, I still try my best to tolerate going to college and do my best in classes even when my anxiety comes back.

[contxt]	4 0 1 Got any advice for a lonely single fellow in his mid thirties? I miss my friends, and virtual meetings on Zoom don't feel the same as meeting in person!  EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The pandemic has been hard on many people, those in relationships and those looking for new ones! Have you tried to develop a new hobby or interest that you can do with others once the pandemic is over?  EOS 4 0 3 Well, I've been writing enough poetry to publish a book, so I'll certainly do that. I know the pandemic has been rough for everyone. Hopefully my doctor will say I qualify for the vaccine soon.  EOS 4 0 4 Getting my stimulus check in the next week or so would certainly make me a bit happier, too.  EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's great! Poetry is something you can share in person or over video link. What about physical activities? I think that yoga might be something that you can do by yourself and with others. There are a bunch of videos on sites like YouTube.  EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A stimulus check! Yes, we can all use money during these trying times.  EOS 4 0 7 Oh, I took advantage of virtual yoga and zumba early on during the pandemic. Friends had virtual classes. Eventually they were able to go back to work. Being disabled is a poverty trap for a lot of people, not just me. I really want to find a girlfriend once I get vaccinated.  EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I have tried yoga myself, but it wasn't really my thing. I prefer walking and riding a bike.  EOS 4 1 9 [Question] Do you have to wait until you get vaccinated to start working on getting a girlfriend? 
[reference_response]	do you have to wait until you get vaccinated to start working on getting a girlfriend?
[hypothesis_response]	i have never had a girlfriend, but i'm sure it's good to get some exercise.

[contxt]	0 0 1 Thank you. I've lost my job and I'm very nervous about the future  EOS 0 0 2 As a result I am having a hard time sleeping  EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Wow, that's very hard. I would be anxious too.  EOS 0 0 4 That makes me feel a lot better. Have you ever lost your job?  EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have. I was laid off. It was nerve-racking, but also really sad.  EOS 0 0 6 What helped you get through it?  EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I had a bit in savings, but I looked for new jobs mostly. I was on unemployment insurance for about a month before I found a new job.  EOS 0 1 8 [Question] Have you made any plans yet about how to move forward?  EOS 0 1 9 [Others] I can offer some suggestions if you would like. I know about a lot of resources  EOS 0 0 10 I am a gig worker, so I cannot apply for IU. Its very hard, but i also have some savings.  EOS 0 0 11 What kind of tools would you recommend I use to get through this  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Well, falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while. If you have any food insecurity as a result, there are often local food banks. It's really not something to be embarrased about, so many people face food insecurity through no fault of their own.  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] You could also give a call to your local social services because they will be able to tell you what resources would be available, whether it's a vocational program or temporary assistance.  EOS 0 0 14 Wow you're so helpful and encouraging! It's very nice to talk to you.  EOS 0 0 15 Are there any meds you can recommend to help me sleep?  EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Well, if it's possible, I would talk to a doctor. If you're looking for Over-the-counter sleep medication, melatonin has helped me in the past.  EOS 0 0 17 Wow! I've never used melatonin before. Did it really help you? Are you doing much better now?  EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] It defiitely helps me fall asleep.  EOS 0 1 19 [Information] It's a natural sleep aid.  EOS 0 1 20 [Question] If something like that doesn't work, I would talk to a doctor. I know money will be tight though. Are there any free clinics near you?  EOS 0 0 21 I'll look into it. There's a lot of services in the general area that might be able to help me  EOS 0 0 22 It's been really nice talking to you  EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Thank you. I hope you're feeling a bit better. Is there anything else you want to talk about?  EOS 0 0 24 No I'm okay. I think that's everything :)  EOS 0 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Alright, well I hope you have a good night. Good luck, you've got this!  EOS 0 0 26 You too :) Thanks <3  EOS 0 1 27 [Others] Bye!

[contxt]	1 0 2 I'm very upset.  EOS 1 0 3 He yelled and yelled at me.  EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it?  EOS 1 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him.  EOS 1 0 6 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree  EOS 1 0 7 He said I was worthless.  EOS 1 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship!  EOS 1 0 9 Well that's good for you, but I'm so mad right now I can't see straight!  EOS 1 1 10 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him.  EOS 1 0 11 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time.  EOS 1 1 12 [Others] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him?  EOS 1 1 13 [Question] How long were the two of you together?  EOS 1 0 14 More than a year, but I've known him since childhood.  EOS 1 0 15 That's what makes me so mad!  EOS 1 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you've known one another so long!  EOS 1 0 17 All those years of friendship down the drain.  EOS 1 0 18 Should I call him?  EOS 1 1 19 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better  EOS 1 0 20 But all of my friends are still friends with him!  EOS 1 0 21 And they took his side!  EOS 1 1 22 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex.  EOS 1 0 23 How did you get through it?  EOS 1 1 24 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours?  EOS 1 0 25 Not one!  EOS 1 1 26 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class .. that was a great way to meet new people  EOS 1 0 27 I'm not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people.  EOS 1 1 28 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you?  EOS 1 0 29 He's a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him.  EOS 1 1 30 [Providing Suggestions] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly  EOS 1 0 31 But maybe I deserved it.  EOS 1 1 32 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly  EOS 1 0 33 Yes, he did.  EOS 1 1 34 [Providing Suggestions] No you did not! Please don't think like that  EOS 1 0 35 I'm just so angry that I could break something.  EOS 1 0 36 And maybe I will do that!  EOS 1 1 37 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will.  EOS 1 1 38 [Information] There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this  EOS 1 0 39 But what if it doesn't pass?  EOS 1 0 40 And I cannot afford therapy.  EOS 1 1 41 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now  EOS 1 1 42 [Information] There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free  EOS 1 0 43 I don't know if I could do that. I don't like talking about my problems with strangers.  EOS 1 1 44 [Others] And yet here we are :P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found. 
[reference_response]	and yet here we are p. therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, i have found.
[hypothesis_response]	i think the best thing to do is to find a therapist who you can work with. there are many that will help you get back on your feet.

[contxt]	0 1 2 [Question] Can you tell me more about why you are scared for the future?  EOS 0 0 3 I got fired because of Covid, and I don't know how I'll be able to find a job and have an income.  EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems that Covid has had a negative effect on your employment and financial insecurity is weighing heavily on you.  EOS 0 0 5 Yes that is correct, and with the job market, how am I supposed to find a secured job.  EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that feeling of insecurity, and how helpless you feel. I myself have been in the position of loss of income and financial insecurity in the past, and while it was hard while I was in the valley, I was able to walk out of it with some valuable lessons.  EOS 0 0 7 That is true, I just have to work hard for myself. I am learning valuable lessons like the idea that companies don't care about their workers, etc. Working more on myself sounds like the better option.  EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are already identifying areas of self improvement. A person with confidence in themselves and the ability to reflect and grow are promising attributes potential employers look for.  EOS 0 0 9 Thank you for all that you've done today, I couldn't get through it without you dude.  EOS 0 0 10 Thank you for your time today, hearing my concerns about the future!  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are so welcome. I know that you will succeed in your employment search as you have the skills and humility that potential employers are looking for.  EOS 0 0 12 I'll continue to keep on the lookout for new job opportunities, as well as improving myself for the long term. I appreciate it!  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] As you continue your job search, can you think of ways that you could trim your cost of living for the short term? Returning to the basics for a time could help save you money while you take the next steps with your career. Things like planning meals ahead of time, using items you already have instead of buying new, letting go of subscriptions you don't use daily or don't deem necessary.  EOS 0 0 14 I could definitely reduce my spending like going out less for fast food, cutting my Netflix and Hulu subscriptions, and prepare my own meals for the next week weeks, as I try to find a new job. This would definitely help with my concerns about income and financial security.  EOS 0 1 15 [Information] Our lifestyle seems to be all about convenience and instant gratification, I myself being guilty of wanting those as well. But I think when we strip our needs down to the basics for a while we allow ourselves to find what is really necessary, as well as what is truly important to us.  EOS 0 0 16 Very true, people definitely need to find their fitting for when things go wrong. Failure or bad events give us time to think about the important things in life, as well as our true needs.  EOS 0 1 17 [Others] And it is important to remember that everyone goes through cycles of feast or famine, and that when you are walking through a famine you yourself are not a failure. As long as you know you are doing your best to succeed under the circumstances you have been handed, you will never truly be a failure to yourself or to others.

[hypothesis_response]	i completely understand. i had a hard time finding work when i was younger and i had to cut out food and use subscriptions. i was surprised at how much i enjoyed being able to eat.

[contxt]	4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression.  EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder.  EOS 4 1 3 [Question] What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin?  EOS 4 0 4 I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago.  EOS 4 1 5 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular?  EOS 4 0 6 Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus. I miss seeing my friends and family.  EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them.  EOS 4 0 8 Yes, definitely. I hope the pandemic will end.  EOS 4 1 9 [Question] I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all?  EOS 4 0 10 I haven't thought about dying at all. I take medication each day for my depression, but there are times when I still feel sad.  EOS 4 1 11 [Information] Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information. I only ask because thoughts of suicide are normal and anxiety and depression increase the chances of suicide.  EOS 4 0 12 You're welcome. I understand, but I am not suicidal.  EOS 4 1 13 [Question] What would you like to talk about, then? We could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. What would make you feel better?  EOS 4 0 14 I would like to talk about solutions since I feel like the problem is defined.  EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I know what it is like to be depressed. I also take medication for this. For solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. Have you considered this? 
[reference_response]	i know what it is like to be depressed. i also take medication for this. for solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. have you considered this?

[contxt]	1 0 7 Hello there are you there?  EOS 1 1 8 [Others] sorry i'm here  EOS 1 0 9 I have checked his email folders and we have talked about his over the top usage of porn and online dating sites. He has admitted that he is in fact a sex addict! Should I hold on or should I let it go? Just find someone else that I can actually trust?  EOS 1 1 10 [Question] First of all, I have a fre questions to ask  EOS 1 1 11 [Question] Does the idea of him being sex addict change how you feel about him?  EOS 1 0 12 What's the fre question? what is fre?  EOS 1 0 13 Not necessarily . Just the trust issue really.  EOS 1 1 14 [Others] I would say you should cut tie with him. Being into porn is a serious issue but what's more important is he lied to you about that  EOS 1 0 15 We've known each other for years and have been friends for a very long time.. We dated on and off and things just seem to always go back to this weird off place.  EOS 1 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you can also feel it yourself that there's something not right between you and him  EOS 1 0 17 I appreciate your thoughts.  EOS 1 0 18 So you don't think I should give him another chance?  EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] This is a wake up call for you I must say, to get away from him  EOS 1 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] I think you should sit down and tell him to take a break, this doesn't mean completely break up but some time for both of you to think it over  EOS 1 0 21 I feel like I really can't trust him and find myself looking through his computer and phone questioning things. makes me feel crazy.  EOS 1 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you feel, it's not easy to get over this feeling  EOS 1 0 23 Is this a clean site or do people use it for porn chat?  EOS 1 1 24 [Others] That's why you need some time for yourself to think whether you can forgive him and try to help him or not  EOS 1 0 25 I know . That sounds like great advice. Hard to pull off during the pandemic though.  EOS 1 1 26 [Self-disclosure] To be honest, watching porn is normal, however, I feel that if someone is too into it, as in watch it more than 1-2 times a month, it's problematic and won't be easy to fix  EOS 1 1 27 [Question] Do you live with him?  EOS 1 0 28 Ah. I think it's more of a real issue when it comes to controlling himself or using sites because he was single for so long. He is currently staying with me.  EOS 1 1 29 [Providing Suggestions] You can ask him to stop doing that for you, if he really cares, he will try  EOS 1 0 30 His latest obsession has been 3d printing. I have found weird sites with ' funny'' dildos on them in his feed and stored data. Do you think he might be gay?  EOS 1 0 31 Like humor I understand but...  EOS 1 1 32 [Others] goodness  EOS 1 0 33 stored data with adult printed groups on fb! dildos with star wars themes. Immature stuff. IDK.?

EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is there something that you'd like to talk about?  EOS 3 0 4 It's mainly my husband. His spending habits are out of control. He thinks he need to reward himself for living. We can't survive if he keeps gifting himself.  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Wow that sounds like a big problem. Is he aware of how much distress this is causing you?

[contxt]	4 0 1 I am not that good  EOS 4 0 2 I have tried everything but not able to find suitable job  EOS 4 1 3 [Question] I'm sorry to hear that. What would you like to talk about today?  EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Would you like to discuss job-search strategies?  EOS 4 0 5 Yes  EOS 4 0 6 I actually created good profile on LinkedIn  EOS 4 1 7 [Information] We're in the middle of a pandemic, so it's been hard for everyone to conduct a job search.  EOS 4 0 8 but so many people apply for same openings within few minutes.  EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] That's a great start. The quality of your profile is important. Did you ask anyone to give you feedback on your profile?  EOS 4 0 10 Its highly competitive nowadays  EOS 4 0 11 Yes, I am taking feedback from my ex-colleagues  EOS 4 1 12 [Information] That's good. Have you benefited from their feedback? Do you think a profession resume writer might be of help?  EOS 4 0 13 They have been very helpful but because of pandemic its pretty slow and lot of people are applying for same profiles  EOS 4 1 14 [Question] What sort of position and in what industry?  EOS 4 0 15 I actually used to help people in the past in their profiles but now its not working  EOS 4 0 16 I have a software background with business intelligence  EOS 4 0 17 Looking for position as business analyst of BI Developer  EOS 4 1 18 [Information] That sounds like a competitive profile under normal circumstances.  EOS 4 0 19 I have worked for several years in a dynamic startup enviornment  EOS 4 1 20 [Question] The demand for those positions has probably dropped because of the economic slowdown. is there any other sort of job that would interest you?  EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] Is that the kind of job that you can do from home?  EOS 4 0 22 I was working on a senior position but I am looking for profiles like early starters  EOS 4 0 23 The senior positions are difficult to grasp because of economic slowdown  EOS 4 0 24 Yes, I was working from home for a while in my previous organization  EOS 4 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If you are good with numbers and software, you are probably a good fit for other jobs.  EOS 4 0 26 Yes, I have atleast 5 different resumes with little tweaks. In a startup, you end up gaining knowledge of various fields.  EOS 4 1 27 [Question] So you're interested in going into the startup world?  EOS 4 0 28 No, I don't want to go back startup world again. That's not at all reliable  EOS 4 0 29 Its highly risky  EOS 4 1 30 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok. So you want stability and a higher-level position.  EOS 4 0 31 Stability is much more important, I don't need a higher-level position at this point of time. I am already looking for junior profiles to enter faster in the job market  EOS 4 1 32 [Question] Is it possible that you are overqualified for those positions? 
[reference_response]	is it possible that you are overqualified for those positions?
[hypothesis_response]	i think that you've done your research and are confident that you will find a job that will be fulfilling for you. you seem like you have a great attitude.

[contxt]	4 1 1 [Question] Hello!  EOS 4 0 2 How are you?  EOS 4 1 3 [Others] I'm fine. How are you? Is there any issue I can help you with?  EOS 4 0 4 Yeah I'm really depressed. I just found out my buddy of 20 years is now posting that he believes Trump and that the election is being stolen from him. I thought I knew him but now I don't know.  EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's a really tough thing to deal with. It can be hard to be confronted with a different, unexpected side from a trusted friend.  EOS 4 0 6 And I had this guy as my best man for my wedding  EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps you can try reasoning with him. I'm certain that your judgement in friendships is not flawed and although he has made quite the yikes choice, he still has redeemable qualities. Especially if he wasn't making his political viewpoint known until recently. It leans towards the idea that with the right information, he'll understand that Trump is a big loser and he lost lmao  EOS 4 0 8 I tried but he says that he's sick and tired of Facebook and Twitter putting a muzzle on Trump and ever since he's been on Parler he now knows the truth  EOS 4 0 9 It's like he doesn't believe science anymore  EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Consider directing him to news sources that are not Twitter or Facebook, though I know this is hard to do. it is just a teensy bit funny he thinks that Trump is being muzzled on twitter when they are not deleting any of his tweets.  EOS 4 0 11 Yeah he thinks it's wrong that Twitter is flagging his tweets and he's mad that Facebook are taking down these groups that he feels are telling the truth  EOS 4 1 12 [Question] This seems like a very sudden reaction from him, from what I've gathered, seeing as how it took you by surprise. Is there anything going on his life that may have put him into a negative mindset? Perhaps he's having problems in a relationship or at work that is leading him to rabbit holes on the internet.  EOS 4 0 13 He just got furloughed.  EOS 4 0 14 Maybe like 3 weeks ago  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I'm so sorry to hear that. He might be struggling with that and looking to shift his negative feelings onto another issue, one that has the support of many. It could be providing him comfort to be angry at the suppression of Twitter rather than coming to terms with his own turmoil. I think talking to him about his job status might be a start in reasoning his new outlook.  EOS 4 0 16 I dunno. How do you think I should approach him about that? He's sort of touchy about the whole subject.  EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] Gently. It's never a good idea to press the issue, especially if it seems like he's trying to avoid it.  EOS 4 0 18 Yeah, it just seems whenever I try to chat about anything it just ends up in an agrument.  EOS 4 1 19 [Information] Perhaps you should implore the help of somebody else in his life. I understand wanting to help your friend, especially when it's negatively impacting your own mental health, but there's only so much one person can do. You both deserve to be in a good head space and asking for help is okay.

[contxt]	1 0 0 Hello  EOS 1 1 1 [Others] Hi! How are you today?  EOS 1 0 2 I'm grounded so i'm not happy  EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. It must be hard.  EOS 1 1 4 [Question] Can I ask what has happened?  EOS 1 0 5 My sibling broke the tv and blamed it on me and my parents believed them  EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. That must be a hard situation, to not have your folks believe you.  EOS 1 0 7 It is very frustrating  EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Have you spoken with your sibling about why they lied?  EOS 1 0 9 No, we just got into a yelling fight about it and are both in our rooms now  EOS 1 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure it's frustrating when you know you're correct and no one believes you.  EOS 1 0 11 Yes it is  EOS 1 0 12 I'd rather just run away from everything  EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] It's not cool that you're sibling lied, but it may be a good time to breathe a second. Running away never solved anything  EOS 1 0 14 It is late at night  EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] So probably it's quiet. this is a good time to take a breath and , literally try and sleep on it.  EOS 1 1 16 [Question] What do you want to see happen?  EOS 1 0 17 that is probably a good idea. I want my sibling to be punished not me and for parents to believe me  EOS 1 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] OK, I understand.  EOS 1 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] So, then, it's how to figure out how to make that happen.  EOS 1 0 20 well my parents dont believe me so not much i can do  EOS 1 1 21 [Question] May I ask why they believe your sibling? Is your sibling a different age?  EOS 1 0 22 they are younger and the favorite  EOS 1 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand.  EOS 1 0 24 I just need to wait until I'm 18 so I can move far away  EOS 1 1 25 [Question] So, it sounds like you already have a plan to turn things around. How far away from 18 are you, if I can ask?  EOS 1 0 26 1 year  EOS 1 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] OK, good for you. It may not seem like it, but you can do anything for a year.  EOS 1 0 28 True.  EOS 1 0 29 I can't wait  EOS 1 1 30 [Question] So, the question is....how do you deal in the short term?  EOS 1 0 31 It will be nice to get away and never talk to family again  EOS 1 0 32 Just hole up in my room and not talk to anyone from now on I think  EOS 1 0 33 only talk when necessary  EOS 1 1 34 [Providing Suggestions] Yes. I was going to suggest the "grey rock" technique.  EOS 1 1 35 [Providing Suggestions] You would be only as polite as you need to be, and only engage others in a limited way. You go about your business as you need to without the involvement of your other family members.  EOS 1 0 36 That is a good idea  EOS 1 0 37 I will just do that  EOS 1 0 38 i can handle that for a year  EOS 1 0 39 thank you for your help  EOS 1 1 40 [Others] you're welcome!

[contxt]	0 0 2 I'm dealing with a lot of frustration and anxiety.  EOS 0 1 3 [Question] How are you?  EOS 0 0 4 Frustrated and anxious  EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I understand how that can be.  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Would you like to tell me about it?  EOS 0 0 7 Ok. I have a friend who I've known a long time, who is one of my closest friends, but who is extremely insecure. She constantly seeks affirmation that I love and care for her, even though she should KNOW I do, since we have been friends for so long.  EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can understand how that can become a source of frustration after a while.  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] Would you like to share what pushed it beyond the normal point today?  EOS 0 0 10 It's just been an ongoing thing that has escalated recently because she's so afraid and timid and doesn't believe anyone could really love or care for her. I get sick of having to say that of course I love her.  EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I can relate because I also have a close friend that seeks constant reaffirmations.  EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Have you spoken with her about this?  EOS 0 0 13 I have. I address it every time it comes up. She always sells herself short. Recently I suggested she could babysit my kids, she agreed, then almost immediately said it was ok if I had someone better in mind, and didn't want her, even though I had asked her!  EOS 0 0 14 do you talk to your friend about it?  EOS 0 1 15 [Information] Sometimes it is very difficult to see yourself through someone elses eyes when you undervalue yourself.  EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] I know it may be difficult to remain patient when your friend repeatedly does this, but maybe you could explain to her that it makes you feel like she is mistrustful of your opinion when she second guesses your taste in friends.  EOS 0 0 17 Yes, I know. Until she finds her self worth, it doesn't matter what any of her friends say to her.  EOS 0 0 18 I have actually told her that. That it seems like she doesn't trust me.  EOS 0 1 19 [Others] Possibly explaining it in a way she can relate to would be helpful.  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] I did in fact speak with my friend and it helped our relationship quite a bit. We continue to be very close 20 years later.  EOS 0 0 21 It's frustrating to me and gives me anxiety because I wish I could change her to see herself the way I, and others, do. But I know I can't make her see her self worth. That's something she has to find for herself.  EOS 0 0 22 That's good to hear about you and your friend.  EOS 0 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I can feel your frustration just by our conversation, and I too wish that she could see that you value both her and your friendship enough to reach out to someone that can just listen. Don't forget that your feelings are valid as well.  EOS 0 0 24 I know they are. And yes, she's dealing with a lot, but we all are, and it would be so much better for her if she could trust the people who love her to actually love her.  EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes you have to take a step back and fill your own cup.  EOS 0 0 26 Indeed. Thank you for your input.  EOS 0 1 27 [Question] Do you think a break would help you feel better able to deal with the demands of her friendship?  EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Do you think a break would help you feel better able to deal with the demands of her friendship? 
[reference_response]	do you think a break would help you feel better able to deal with the demands of her friendship?
[hypothesis_response]	i think it would help to take some time out of the day to relax and get a good rest. you could end the day with a nice fresh air.

[situation]	One of my oldest friends is extremely insecure. She's been this way for a long time, but fear and immaturity have made it worse recently. It's become super frustrating to have to constantly reassure her that I love her, and she's really my friend, cause her insecurity makes her doubt anyone could love her. I'm anxious about it.

EOS 3 0 5 my properties have been auctioned by the bank  EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] it seems that you are having a bad day, mostly attributed to the fact that your properties have been auctioned by the bank. Correct me if I'm wrong  EOS 3 0 7 Yes you are correct the problems with the bank how do i solve not to sink into depression  EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] So, I have also struggled with that in the past. The way that really helped me put things into perspective is to cut off some of the vice you have in your life!

EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Would recommend seeking conversations with friends or family  EOS 3 0 13 thank you yes i think that will do me better  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] By speaking to those who are close with you, you will definitely feel relief.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I want to let you know that you are going to make it. There is light at the end of the tunnel and only you can be alter it with your willpower.

[contxt]	0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that you are feeling worn out and don't know what else you can do to help your child. Is there something specific going on or is it just life in general?  EOS 0 0 6 My daughter struggles with school work and memory. She learns differently and needs lots of support. I have contacted the school a number of times over the years but never really had any support or acknowledgement from them. I guess it's just an accumulation of things.  EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have tried hard to help her and that is admirable. Don't beat yourself up and be proud of the things you have done for her.  EOS 0 0 8 But what do I now. She's 17 and it's so difficult to give her the time and then encourage her to tell me when she needs help and for her to be willing to accept it.  EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] While I do not have kids, from what I have seen my friends and family do in this situation is try to find something that your daughter is interested in and attempt to build off of that. So instead of her learning to just learn, she is learning something that is relevant to her. Maybe that might spark something in her to come up with her way of learning since traditional methods aren't working.  EOS 0 0 10 That is great advice. She does climb and hasn't been able to climb or see her friends with everything closed. I think as she will be able to again soon may be that will help her to relax and get back into it. She does learn through repetition but has lacked enthusiasm especially in the last few months.  EOS 0 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Having her go climbing more sounds like a good plan. Hopefully things are opening up around you now that the vaccine is becoming more common.  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Repetition is tough. I know I used a lot of flash cards as a way of learning through high-school and college. It's an old method but it can work.  EOS 0 0 13 She had heart surgery as a baby so has actually had the vaccine herself as she's in the vulnerable category. I think she ends up spending so long making aide memoires that she then leaves herself so little time to actually study.  EOS 0 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can imagine after having heart surgery as a baby she wants to live life to it's fullest extent and prioritizes making memories over school. Does she ever talk about what her plans are for after high-school? At some point she will have to connect the dots of having to get a job to be able to go out and have fun, and unfortunately doing OK in school comes with that. That or a vocational school to learn a trade (what I personally did).  EOS 0 0 15 What did you do? Her interests are music and photography. Recently she has started a gardening club with the horticulture department at school. She does enjoy her social life well when she has been able to have it. She has had social ups and downs but apart from the epidemic she has been happier than in her earlier years at school. You are right she is becoming an adult and will find her place. At 17 I guess she doesn't have to decide just yet.  EOS 0 0 16 You have certainly made me feel a bit more positive.  EOS 0 1 17 [Others] Sorry for the delay. I am glad you are feeling more positive. I was into cars so I went to vocational school to become an auto mechanic. After a couple years of that I realized I wasn't cut out for physical labor and went to college. But the knowledge from working on cars helped me understand things better at college since I had real world applications I could use it on.  EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Gardening and Horticulture is a great hobby! That definitely could cross over into some of her science classes to make things more interesting and relevant to her.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Not great. I think I have a problem with alcohol.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How so?  EOS 3 0 3 I've been drinking a lot and some mornings I wake up not remembering the night before.  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I have done that myself, but being self aware is an advantage not many people have. How long has this been happening?  EOS 3 0 5 A couple of months on and off, but it's gotten a lot worse the last couple of weeks.  EOS 3 0 6 I'm afraid I'm going down a bad road, but I don't know how to stop.  EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] These are not the best times... but lets dig deeper to the root of this new behavior.  EOS 3 0 8 How do we do that?  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have been down that road myself, and I didn't have anyone to help me. But luckily, you have resources and support. Help me understand what makes you drink? Is it a trigger like stress? Or just a habit?  EOS 3 0 10 Work has been stressful, but I feel like was before things got bad. Most nights I come home to drink so that I can forget about my day.  EOS 3 1 11 [Question] What do you do for work?  EOS 3 0 12 I work in finance at a large corporation.  EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I can definitely understand your reasoning. I am not justifying your behavior, but at least we see now, it goes hand in hand. The corporate dinner parties and cocktail hours.. it is usually much deeper than the surface  EOS 3 0 14 Hmm. I never thought of it that way.  EOS 3 0 15 I guess maybe I need to look into how such events affect me.  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Usually when I find myself going off the deep end, I can reign it back by realizing that the power lies in me. My control to use a relaxer like a cocktail hour, to just be that. It does not have to be a contest. It should make you feel good, then leave it. But if you cannot control it, try and de-stress another way like baths or massages

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hi. I am worried about my exams.  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Exams are a stressful time. What seems to be the problem?  EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Exams are a stressful time. What seems to be the problem?  EOS 0 0 3 I do not feel like I am properly prepared, even though I have studied.  EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can assure you that countless students including myself have gone through the trials of studying for exams and do feel overwhelmed but it passes.  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you studied?  EOS 0 0 6 I have studied. However, I still feel like I am not prepared. One big problem is that I have no quiet place to study.  EOS 0 1 7 [Information] I get it, distractions can be challenging to overcome at times. Have you thought about going to a library, or a book store?  EOS 0 0 8 I have not. Both of those are great suggestions. I wonder if I should take the time to walk to the library (30 minutes), or just continue to study? Maybe, I know as much as I can know. The anxiety is too much.  EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If it helps you study then the library may be worth the time and effort. Sometimes we can stress out over worrying about not having enough time to study. But trust the work you have done and you will know if it is enough.  EOS 0 0 10 This is very good advice. Have you completed college?  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] Yes, and it wasn't easy but with hard work, it is completely doable. And you have the power within yourself.  EOS 0 0 12 What do you think will happen if I fail this test?  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes it is not about the amount of studying, but the way you study. I like reading my textbooks and highlighting the important parts and then rewriting them so they become ingrained in me. But let us not jump the gun, you haven't failed anything.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hello, I have been better. How are you?  EOS 3 1 2 [Others] good thank you  EOS 3 1 3 [Question] what seems to be the problem  EOS 3 0 4 Well.. I lost my job and so did my husband. Since then we have been fighting all the time. and he doesn't help anymore around the house  EOS 3 0 5 Or with the kids  EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] thats horrible. i understand why you feel this way.  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] have you tried to talk to him about how you feel?  EOS 3 0 8 I have and he turns it into something nasty. Like I am saying he is a lazy piece of garbage, or something like that .  EOS 3 0 9 And it becomes a huge fight  EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] i dont think thats fair on his part. Even though you both are having a hard time he should try to be patient as well  EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Do your kids know about the situation or have you been keeping this from them?  EOS 3 0 12 I wish he would. He sees me taking care of our 4 kids, cleaning, cooking taking care of the animals and he still does nothing  EOS 3 0 13 The see everytime we fight. He usually gets loud and then I get loud. My oldest, 13, sees how he is acting.  EOS 3 0 14 Today marks day 4 that he has been in the room playing games only coming out to get a drink  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] heres what i think. You should try to explain to your kids the situation. At least your oldest so they understand why this is happening and that its not their fault.  EOS 3 0 16 I have had that talk with him, but I should do it again  EOS 3 0 17 My toddlers don't understand  EOS 3 1 18 [Information] thats good. When you have your fights, you should try to keep your toddlers away. its not good for little kids to be experiencing this  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] As for your husband i think you should seek a counselors advice.  EOS 3 0 20 I wish I could. I try to stay quite sometimes but he just keeps going on and on like he wants to fight.  EOS 3 0 21 I think so to, but it is hard since we don't have jobs and no insurance  EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] Because these are hard times, i think that you should try to find a job as soon as possible. Try different apps or websites. try to include both of you so you can connect.  EOS 3 0 23 Oh I have been trying. I have been applying everyday about 20 jobs a day.  EOS 3 0 24 I was thinking of taking the kids to my dad for a weekend to get a break. Should I do that? without him.  EOS 3 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] try to talk to him first. before you take them out try to talk to your husband alone, without the presence of your kids. Try to see things eye to eye. If he start to yell of curse, you must try to stay calm. Be the strong one in the discussion. If things dont work out tell him that you wish to take your kids out for a break.

[contxt]	6 0 14 sure thing :) share  EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Usually I find myself just cooped up inside my room doing the same routine over and over again. That can put us into depressive, unmotivated moods. The thing that started helping me the most, was changing that routine even a little bit. If I feel unmotivated, I like to change my surroundings! Usually for me, that means moving to the living room, or to the back porch. As silly as that sounds, it really helps to switch up where you are trying to get things done.  EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] It's also really helpful to try and do new things if you are feeling unmotivated. Obviously that is difficult right now, but there are definitely things you can try! Like going on walks outside, or trying new little hobbies. I personally have tried out drawing and typing to help distract me when I am feeling overwhelmed  EOS 6 0 17 You bring up a good point about changing environment  EOS 6 0 18 I feel like everyday is the same day samething over and over that might be why I'm feeling so down. Plus i work in the basement so I dont get much sunlight  EOS 6 0 19 Maybe I'll try moving to the living room :)  EOS 6 0 20 I've picked up a couple hobbies and they definitely help keep me busy but with school and all I find I dont have a lot of time for them  EOS 6 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh yeah that probably is taking a bit toll on you working in the basement. I definitely suggest moving to the living room every now and then just to feel that small change. :)  EOS 6 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] You could also plan out your days if it would help! Try and find time for the things that will bring you joy, whether that involves waking up earlier, or moving some routine things around  EOS 6 0 23 Yeah maybe I should do that  EOS 6 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] And I can tell you really do miss your friends, so it's super important to make time to talk to them too!  EOS 6 0 25 gotta switch things up  EOS 6 0 26 Yeah I should chat with my friends more too  EOS 6 0 27 Its hard to fine time but I should try  EOS 6 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is definitely hard, but it's important for your mental health to keep the people you love close to you :)  EOS 6 0 29 very very true especially in these difficult times  EOS 6 0 30 Im hoping they get the vaccine developed asap  EOS 6 0 31 and everythiung can go back to normal  EOS 6 1 32 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes exactly. And yeah that will be so nice when we are finally able to leave again and feel normal. But unfortunately we can't wait around for that since it's so up in the air recently. So I'm glad that you are wanting to change little things in your life to keep you happy until then  EOS 6 0 33 Yeah thank you for your advice ill try implementing them in my life more  EOS 6 0 34 I feel much better now :) thank you for your time  EOS 6 1 35 [Others] Of course! I had a good time chatting with you! Thank you as well :)

[contxt]	3 0 1 Just dealing with alot of depression lately due to issues with a lot of things. The most of which being with my ex-gf and her pregnancy. She immediately cut me off once she gave birth, so I haven't met or seen my child. It's been 7 months. We were in the process of working on an agreement outside of court and since this I've had to work with the court to get this started but it's been hard with COVID and not being able to meet with someone in person.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Did you sign the birth certificate?  EOS 3 0 3 No. That's the other thing. She didn't let me know about the birth until 2 hours after the fact. The hospital would only let one person there with her and her sister was there. I don't know if she put someone else as the father or not.  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is absolutely horrible, and I can understand the reasoning behind your emotions now. You are a wonderful soul to care so deeply. You deserve to be a Father.  EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] Have you contacted any legal help?  EOS 3 0 6 Thank you. I appreciate that. I've been in contact with the Self-Help center at the courthouse to help me with the process of getting a DNA test and getting things going on a case.

[reference_response]	ok that is one step closer to justice. when is that going to take place, and did you find out if that can be expedited?
[hypothesis_response]	i have also had to do a dna testing and i had to talk to my ex about why i had this happen and what i was going through with the situation.

Can you tell me a little about the guy you are afraid to open up to?  EOS 3 0 13 Well I met him on a dating site and he lives in France but he is also turkish i dont know much about turkish men but he says he loves me and he sees something with me but i barely know we only talking for few weeks now  EOS 3 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Well, I would recommend not taking things too quickly but relationships online CAN work - I met my fiance of ten years online.  EOS 3 0 15 oh that is wonderful  EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] But we did take it very slowly and talked for a year before we met in person.  EOS 3 0 17 i told him i dont want to rush things he fine with taking things slow but he does want me to take a chance with him  EOS 3 0 18 im 23 and he is 27 he is a positive sweet guy currently he is battling covid  EOS 3 1 19 [Question] Well, if he is reliable then he will be happy to wait till you are ready to meet. Where do you live, do you mind me asking?  EOS 3 0 20 I live in America and he live in France  EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] Ah well definitely do not contemplate meeting him whilst the pandemic is on! But it might be good excuse to put things off for a bit, do you think?  EOS 3 0 22 I would not be comfortable going to france during a pandemic I want to wait until everyone gets vaccinated first  EOS 3 1 23 [Information] I do think that it might be a while before travel in Europe fully opens up again. Things are not good here.  EOS 3 0 24 u live in europe?  EOS 3 1 25 [Information] I am in the UK. The pandemic is very bad here at the moment.  EOS 3 0 26 yeah I heard it is another strain there  EOS 3 1 27 [Others] Two more! It's very scary and I don't recommend coming either here or continental Europe right now.  EOS 3 0 28 he understands that im not meeting him no time soon but when the pandemic is over I do not know if I should continue to pursue him or not  EOS 3 0 29 I dont even have a passport and i care about my health and others im not traveling for a long time  EOS 3 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] So, I hear you saying that you are a bit wary of the relationship and do not know if it can work in the real world?  EOS 3 0 31 Yes because I do not have experience with Turkish men and I am scared of him being controlling and abusive I guess its due to sterotypes i read about and heard  EOS 3 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Turkish people are lovely and welcoming - you should not worry about that :). But don't let yourself be pushed into anything you don't feel ready for  EOS 3 0 33 Yes I agree with u have u met any turkish people?  EOS 3 1 34 [Information] Yes I know a few Turkish people. They're very nice people, don't listen to any stereotypes!  EOS 3 0 35 I think its also due to me being hurt before but scared of trying something new giving a new person a chance I have major trust issues  EOS 3 1 36 [Self-disclosure] I do understand how trying new things can be very difficult - this is something that I struggle with myself. But - if you don't take a chance, how can you know what might have happened?  EOS 3 0 37 Yes I agree with u there  EOS 3 1 38 [Others] I really hope that I have been able to reassure you a little bit and help you to try to think things through.

[contxt]	4 0 1 Got any advice for a lonely single fellow in his mid thirties? I miss my friends, and virtual meetings on Zoom don't feel the same as meeting in person!  EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The pandemic has been hard on many people, those in relationships and those looking for new ones! Have you tried to develop a new hobby or interest that you can do with others once the pandemic is over?  EOS 4 0 3 Well, I've been writing enough poetry to publish a book, so I'll certainly do that. I know the pandemic has been rough for everyone. Hopefully my doctor will say I qualify for the vaccine soon.  EOS 4 0 4 Getting my stimulus check in the next week or so would certainly make me a bit happier, too.  EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's great! Poetry is something you can share in person or over video link. What about physical activities? I think that yoga might be something that you can do by yourself and with others. There are a bunch of videos on sites like YouTube.  EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A stimulus check! Yes, we can all use money during these trying times.

[contxt]	1 0 15 agreed - i dont think they would fire me, maybe get reprimanded or more likely a guilt trip as to why I cant do it. Im just not sure what kind of boundaries I set when we have things due, and just literally no time.  EOS 1 1 16 [Information] Setting boundaries can be difficult if you haven't done that a lot. When we think we don't have the ability to say NO, then we feel trapped, worn out, depressed, taken advantage of. People need to know that we reasonably can say no.  EOS 1 0 17 Well, I have to set boundaries, because working till 11pm most nights is not sustainable. and who on earth is going to view, let alone sign a contract at 12am  EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I think that would be the first step. Determine how many hours you feel you COULD work. Then advise them that is what you will do. Find out what kind of timelines there are, and if you can't do it, don't go beyond your boundaries. It is obviously destroying your life. It really isn't healthy for you.  EOS 1 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] Exactly. It isn't working for you. Something has to change. And you sound intelligent, so you can determine what will work for you -- perhaps a range of hours, but definitely not 14 hours. Unless you are a young kid. lol Even then, that's a lot.  EOS 1 0 20 yeah - ill come up with reasonable boundaries till 5:30 is reasonable, and if its a do or die situation cap it at 7:30 --- and thats only for dire situations. if that doesnt work, well then i guess either i dont have a job, or people figure out how to work in regular hours.  EOS 1 1 21 [Others] That sounds reasonable to me. And if they try to make you feel guilty, reject that. Tell them, I'm sorry, but I feel this is reasonable, and truly it is.  EOS 1 0 22 hah i used to go out like a young kid, but still - just because most of us are working from home 24/7, doesnt mean I actually can work 24/7. even fi i were young, hell no. they dont pay me enough.  EOS 1 0 23 thanks i really appreciate it. it sounds reasonable, and its what a coworker told me. if i dont set boundaries, i will crack.  EOS 1 1 24 [Affirmation and Reassurance] No one can work 24/7. I think they may not even be aware you are struggling. So communication is important.  EOS 1 1 25 [Others] You don't want to crack. It's not worth it.  EOS 1 0 26 yeah, i think a call to not just my boss is in order, but also HR to advise them of the situation. they need to start telling managers, we are NOT front of the line workers, nor police, fire, etc. our jobs are not THAT important.  EOS 1 1 27 [Others] I will say a prayer that you communicate your needs politely but firmly. And not believe false guilt. As you said, you aren't putting out fires and doing CPR.  EOS 1 0 28 plus netflix, hulu, amazon keep releasing new shows. if i need a reason, it can simply be to watch tv and detox (so to speak) and get away from the BS of work (obv stating it more nicely than that).  EOS 1 1 29 [Information] This has been a stressful year for many of us, you don't need to be working yourself into depression and exhaustion.  EOS 1 1 30 [Providing Suggestions] You really do not NEED a reason not to work unreasonable hours.  EOS 1 0 31 agreed 100% --- ive already hit those points, and it is not good for anyone let alone my job.  EOS 1 1 32 [Others] It isn't anyone's business what you do on your off hours.

[hypothesis_response]	yes, it'll be hard, but there are always ways to find a way to work things out.

EOS 1 0 8 Okay are you female or male? or how do you identify?  EOS 1 0 9 I ask because i would want to hear your opinion on why girls pick unecessary fights for no reason with their friends  EOS 1 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I am a 65 year old female with lots of experience with children and grandchildren.  EOS 1 0 11 Oh that is great  EOS 1 0 12 Nice to make your acquaintance  EOS 1 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It happens a lot that girls pick fights with their friends and it ends up hurting, right?  EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] My experience is that girls pick fights with whoever they feel safe with. Very strange but my grandchildren told me that they yell at me and take out their bad day on me because they know I will always love them no matter what.  EOS 1 0 15 Really?  EOS 1 0 16 I do not understand the insecurities in this case  EOS 1 1 17 [Others] Really. What happened?  EOS 1 0 18 Few months ago she picked a fight with another of our friend for no reason  EOS 1 0 19 Now its my turn  EOS 1 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How do you think you should handle it? Did something happen in her life and she's taking it out on you?  EOS 1 0 21 And for some reason when this happens she expects you to come crawling asking her what you did wrong when infact you did nothing. she would start recalling what happened 5years ago  EOS 1 0 22 I really do not know or understand how she processes things  EOS 1 0 23 She recently had a baby and we where fine through out the pregnancy stretch, up untill the last month she stopped responding to me.  EOS 1 0 24 the baby will be months soon and no word from her  EOS 1 1 25 [Reflection of feelings] Sounds like she's having some issues and she's not happy and taking it out on you. I'm sure that makes you feel like the bad person here.  EOS 1 0 26 Its actually disgusting how a grown up continuously act like a child  EOS 1 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know. Have you thought about reaching out and just letting her know you are here to speak when she's ready and congratulations on the baby? Maybe she needs an opening?  EOS 1 0 28 Initially it got me worried, however, knowing her and the childish behavior as always I felt more disgust this time cos i would think a now mum would behave better  EOS 1 0 29 Yes well not in that order.  EOS 1 1 30 [Providing Suggestions] How much do you want her in your life?  EOS 1 0 31 I sent her a message on her birthday. thats the least i can do. Like im over it tolerating the bad attitude.  EOS 1 0 32 Honestly right now i do not miss having her in my life and that is sad because we have been friends for over 1 5years.  EOS 1 0 33 I guess i just git tired of managing the Nonsense from her. So now i'm indifferent and bare think about her  EOS 1 1 34 [Providing Suggestions] I wish I could solve this for you but everyone is different. My granddaughter has had to let go of some relationships that were toxic to her well being and felt better after a period of time.  EOS 1 0 35 I know right  EOS 1 0 36 You have been helpful by just listening and giving your 2cents  EOS 1 0 37 Thank you so much  EOS 1 1 38 [Others] There are a lot of good people out there just looking for friends.

[contxt]	3 1 1 [Others] sure, please go ahead and share your story  EOS 3 0 2 pretty much being social isolated due to the pandemic, trying to finish up my studies at the same time, and what's going on in the world with regards to the pandemic. My physical and mental health aren't great, and I am not eating as well as I should or sleeping as well as I should.  EOS 3 0 3 I guess we all go through that in different ways with the pandemic now  EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] it sounds like you are having depression, have you shared your problems with anyone?  EOS 3 0 5 yes sure, I chat with my friend everyday on the phone and that helps to talk about each other's day and my thoughts and feelings, observations with the world etc.  EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that's great! Friends can be big help  EOS 3 0 7 I am just not able to help my tendencies to sleep really late and wake up late. My sleep pattern is really abnormal and I am disappointed in myself. It's not much about the pandemic as just gotten a really bad habit and trying to stay up late and watch movies or catch up with my work. Then it's a vicious circle in which the next day I wake up late, and my day starts late, and so to get as much done, I repeat the same damaging cycle.  EOS 3 1 8 [Others] If you have time, spend at least 1-2h everyday outdoor. You can talk a walk in the park or just simply go to the stores  EOS 3 0 9 So I am having real trouble breaking this pattern. And because I work once or twice a week and not during the day, I don't even have the motivation or need to wake up early.  EOS 3 0 10 I go out only for personal errands and that's once every week or two weeks. I still am not prepared to go out even for walks. But that's just my stubborn thinking.  EOS 3 1 11 [Others] In order to have better sleep pattern, maybe you should exercise, at first your body will be tired which helps you sleep better and earlier  EOS 3 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] spending too much time indoor is very damaging to your mentality. Even the most normal person will go crazy at that rate.  EOS 3 0 13 My thinking is that I had stuck to this for so long it's not my style to compromise and I tend to be stubborn. And that if I had done that, I would have done that early on this year. But other people are doing it but it's also coupled with the pandemic in which I just don't think I or anyone should risk that, since I am basically sacrificing myself, while others in my apartment building are walking freely in and out. So that's my thinking.  EOS 3 0 14 Yes I understand. I do know it's bad to get stuck indoors. Believe me, before all this, I was going out many times a week to the movies and to the gym.  EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I feel you, when everything starts closing down again. I also feel angry because I've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people 
[reference_response]	i feel you, when everything starts closing down again. i also feel angry because i've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people
[hypothesis_response]	i have heard of people who have had a mental illness and have had to go to therapy to help them. i can tell that you have been going out for a while and being lazy is very frustrating.

[contxt]	4 0 1 Hello. What are some of the quickest ways to kill myself?  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Have you talked to someone about this?  EOS 4 0 3 No, why bother? Everyone is just cruel. People are selfish.  EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand people can be cruel and selfish, but not everyone is. Some people want to help! Life is definitely worth living for.  EOS 4 0 5 Not at all. Why would I want to live in a degenerate world where millions die everyday? Be it hunger, disease, murder... Human beings are disgusting. We should go extinct.  EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Talking to someone you are close to, like a family member who cares about you, can definitely help.  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Can you try talking to someone?  EOS 4 0 8 Family? My family kicked me out of their own house 3 years ago. I am nothing but a burden for them. They would just appreciate if I died.  EOS 4 1 9 [Question] What about close friends, or people you care about? I am sure they would not want to lose you.  EOS 4 0 10 I have NO ONE that cares about me. Not a single being.  EOS 4 0 11 Are overdoses painful?  EOS 4 1 12 [Information] I care  EOS 4 0 13 I doubt you do. You are just getting paid to be here.  EOS 4 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, I can feel how sad you are about life and maybe a little overwhelmed with what the next step of life is.  EOS 4 0 15 What would be that next step if I asked you?  EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I used to be really sad about life too. However, helping others who are sad helped me become happier, knowing that I am helping others also become happier.  EOS 4 0 17 What makes you think someone as useless as me could provide any help?  EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Take a deep breathe and think about any happy memories. If you are sad right now, the only way is up from here!  EOS 4 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I believe no one is useless. We were all brought on this earth for a reason.  EOS 4 0 20 That's a very optimistic view...  EOS 4 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] Like I said, I used to be sad too and not optimistic. But now I am optimistic because I know what it is like to be sad, and I don't want others to feel how I have felt in the past.

EOS 3 0 5 i was cheated on severally, and it resulted me to end the relationship  EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you had to deal with a partner recently cheating and a breakup, is this right?  EOS 3 0 7 yes thats it  EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this has been stressful for you and you are trying to figure out how to move on from this.  EOS 3 0 9 exactly, i can tend to focus because i have given so much time and affection, i never thought i would be called the fool after everything i did  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is incredibly difficult to get something like this off your mind and it seems like you are trying your best to move forward with your life  EOS 3 0 11 i want to move on but i dont know how, i tried to but i just cant  EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I have been through this, I learned how to keep myself busy and do things that I enjoy to occupy my mind and let time heal those wounds  EOS 3 0 13 i think you right, maybe i should renew my netflix sub, since i find great interest in movies so as to get some positive vibes and think less of this whole situation  EOS 3 1 14 [Information] Science shows that during a breakup sometimes you romanticize the relationship and view it as better than it actually was and missing something that wasn't as good as you thought  EOS 3 0 15 yh thats true  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] My suggestion is to focus on new hobbies, spend time with friends and family when possible, if you have work you can do in the mean time, if you like to exercise or go outside, all of this is a helpful tool.  EOS 3 0 17 this is really helpful, i really do appreciate this suggestions  EOS 3 1 18 [Others] Don't be afraid to express your feelings and confide in others about your emotions and mental health. It is still a loss and something you should feel comfortable grieving.

[contxt]	1 0 0 Hello.  EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hi there, How are you doing today?  EOS 1 0 2 I am angry today.  EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Would you like to go into the reasons for why you are angry?  EOS 1 0 4 I guess. I have a friend that is being really annoying and dismissive. I feel like they're not being a good friend.  EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Do they act this way often?  EOS 1 0 6 Not really, we were talking recently and she just didn't really want to hear my opinion and talked over me. Normally she's pretty good at listening.  EOS 1 1 7 [Information] Well, everyone, including yourself, is entitled to an off day. Maybe something is going on with her she doesnt want to share. Or possibly even she is trying to share but doesnt know how.  EOS 1 0 8 I guess that could be the case.  EOS 1 0 9 What should I do then?  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps try to reach out and see if anything is wrong.  EOS 1 0 11 So I should just ask her if something is going on?  EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I would remember though, its ok for people to want to be left alone though if things are bad, sometimes they just need their space.  EOS 1 0 13 Ok, that makes sense, I can get like that.  EOS 1 0 14 What if something isn't wrong though?  EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I would just say something along the lines of: Hey, youre not acting like yourself today, anything you want to talk about?  EOS 1 1 16 [Information] I would see if there is anything you can do to help, if not just try and be as supportive as you can.  EOS 1 0 17 Ok, that sounds like a good plan. I'm just a little worried that it won't work because she was acting really rude. So I feel like I don't really want to talk to her right now.  EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Well, youre own health and well being does come first. If you feel it wont get anywhere, give her some space and come back to it at another date if you think you both would be comfortable with it.  EOS 1 0 19 Okay. I think that sounds good. I'll give myself and hopefully her some time to calm down and then maybe ask if she want's to talk?  EOS 1 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a solid plan.  EOS 1 0 21 Thank you for helping! I feel a lot less upset and like I have an actual plan.  EOS 1 0 22 You really helped me see that something could be going on with her that made her act so rude.  EOS 1 1 23 [Others] I am glad i could help!  EOS 1 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] Yeah, everyone including me, forgets that each individual has their own sets of things going on each day. Always good to look at it through their eyes a bit.  EOS 1 0 25 Yeah, I think it's hard to do that when you're upset too.  EOS 1 1 26 [Others] It definitely is. I guess thats what makes us human though. 
[reference_response]	it definitely is. i guess thats what makes us human though.

The holidays aren't helping me feel better about not bringing much money home to help pay for things.  EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Sorry to hear this,have you ever tried selling on Ebay  EOS 3 0 5 I've thought about selling stuff online, but the cost of selling things online isn't really worth it. I've been trying to use facebook marketplace, but I never have anyone who's interested.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Have you ever heard of QVC liquidations,its awesome with some very good returns.  EOS 3 0 7 I've heard of QVC, but I've never heard of QVC liquidations. That might be something for me to consider. Can you give me more details about it?  EOS 3 1 8 [Question] If your interested you will need to submit a sellers I.D. or tax id  EOS 3 0 9 I see. Is this something that you've done to make money?  EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Absolutely  EOS 3 0 11 If you don't mind me asking how much have you made using QVC liquidations?  EOS 3 1 12 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I have made close to 12,000.00 in one year just reselling the returns.Also ESTY is also a great place.  EOS 3 0 13 Wow, what sorts of things have you sold?  EOS 3 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Go to EBAY and scroll down to the the completed section and click it and this will show you the item your searching like homemade items or stuff like back packs that maybe on sell at Walmart and I buy them and see what they are selling for  EOS 3 0 15 Okay, thanks for the suggestions.  EOS 3 1 16 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I have purchased a lot of stuff from walmart and resold it on EBAY  EOS 3 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Its fun  EOS 3 0 18 I worked with someone whose boyfriend did that. I've never thought about doing that.  EOS 3 0 19 I might have to consider doing that so I can feel more helpful to my husband.  EOS 3 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Down load the Walmart app and when you go scan the item with app and sometimes its cheaper  EOS 3 0 21 I don't shop at Walmart very much so thank you for that information.  EOS 3 1 22 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I saw a seller on EBAY make small surf boards and sold them on EBAY well over a hundred dollars.They were 48 inches long but he made good money.  EOS 3 0 23 That is very interesting. I wouldn't think you could make that much from small surfboards.  EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] He painted them and they looked awesome.  EOS 3 0 25 I wouldn't think that anyone would want a short surfboard, but I guess I don't know anything about surfing.  EOS 3 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] People who own and rent their beach house always looking for some new looks  EOS 3 0 27 I suppose you are right.  EOS 3 0 28 Well thanks for the helpful suggestions to make more money.  EOS 3 1 29 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your welcome Don't ever give up there is always ways to make a difference.

[contxt]	4 0 3 Yes I have. I just do not know what to do with myself anymore.  EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I can relate to this heartache as I have gone through similar breakups in my life. The important thing is that we pick ourselves up after something like this.  EOS 4 0 5 I just do not know where or how to start the process.  EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It can be really hard sometimes! It appears that you possess the strength and motivation to be able to pick yourself back up. The factthat you are reaching out for help shows you have the motivation and desire to work to get better!  EOS 4 0 7 I do not want to feel like this forever!  EOS 4 1 8 [Information] Studies indicate that emotions felt immidiately after a breakup eventually subside with time. It is important to take care of yourself in the mean time. Do you have any hobbies?  EOS 4 0 9 Yes. I love to read.  EOS 4 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you like to read? Have you thought about reading self-help books on perhaps depression?  EOS 4 0 11 I do read self help books.  EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Have the books provided you any benefit?  EOS 4 0 13 Not really.  EOS 4 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] I get the sense that you are pretty depressed over you recent breakup that you have taken pretty hard. I also feel your desire to want to feel better. I think this is a step in the right direction for you to get to feeling better.  EOS 4 0 15 I think so too i just do not know where to go from here.  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes it helps in working through these feelings when we reach out to a professional mental health provider. Is this something you have considered?  EOS 4 0 17 I have thought about it before.  EOS 4 1 18 [Question] What has stopped you from doing this in the past?  EOS 4 0 19 I am nervouse about it  EOS 4 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am hearing that while you have thought about reaching out for professional help in the past in regaurds to your mental health, you have not felt comfortable enough to do this as this makes you feel a bit anxious or nervous is that correct?  EOS 4 0 21 Yes that is correct.  EOS 4 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I am nervous in situations that are new to me as well so I understand this. Is there something you can do to get past this nervousness so that you fel comfortable seeking out this help?  EOS 4 0 23 I think that I will always be nervous until I get to know a mental health professional that I trust and am comfortable with.  EOS 4 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like the only way for you to gain that confidence in someone to be able to share your feelings with them, that you will likely need to face that fear in order to make progress, is that right?  EOS 4 0 25 Yes, I guess you are right about that.  EOS 4 1 26 [Question] What would be the forst step you could take in working twards getting over this fear so that you may get the professional help that you feel like you have needed in the past as well as the present?  EOS 4 0 27 I just need to schedule an appointment with someone and go in and meet them face to face.  EOS 4 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is great that you can identify what needs to be done in this situation. It sounds like you are ready and willing to seek out help for yourself!

[contxt]	3 0 0 Hi there  EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hey, how's it going?  EOS 3 0 2 Not bad but I'm just getting fed up with work. working for a big corporate just bored me to tears. It's all I know and I feel trapped like I can't escape. I don't want this to be my life for ever!  EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What is it about your job that you don't like?  EOS 3 0 4 I think it's all the politics of working in an office, the endless meetings and the people trying to get one over on each other. I find it draining.  EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Bleh, sorry to hear that. I think I understand what you're saying.  EOS 3 0 6 Have you had a similar experience?  EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Perhaps it's like following through on your work goals is challenging enough, and then there's a bunch of unnecessary effort on top of it to work around the politics.  EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Yeah, maybe I have. I guess I've been in situations when I was surprised and confused as to why a team couldn't just work together towards the common goal. Does that sound similar?  EOS 3 0 9 It does indeed, actually it's like you work in my office. I'm just fearful that if I try something new I won't be able to support myself financially, do you know what I mean?  EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] For sure. It's true that you don't *have* to work there, but I'm sure there are factors in play that make it difficult to leave.  EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Here's a blunt question- what do you want to do about it? Do you think you want to get better at being happy in this job? Or work towards getting another job?  EOS 3 0 12 That is a very good question. I hadn't thought about it like that. I think I want to try something new and you have helped me realise this. I don't think I actually want to be happier in my current position. The question is how should I approach it?  EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Small steps, I suppose. What do you think the very very first, small step would be?  EOS 3 0 14 I think maybe consider what I actually enjoy and how could I make that profitable.  EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Nice! That's a good first step.  EOS 3 1 16 [Question] And it's a step that doesn't cost anything to do. Just some time, maybe. Do you think you have enough time nowadays to start looking into that?  EOS 3 0 17 I think maybe I could do something on the side while I'm still working until I'm sure of what I want to so. Finding time with a family and a full time job is hard though. That's why so many people get trapped.  EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Yep, for sure. It's not going to be easy. 
[reference_response]	yep, for sure. it's not going to be easy.
[hypothesis_response]	that'll be a good start. i have found that if you feel like you can't do what you want, you'll eventually find what you enjoy and that will take a long time.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together?  EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me.  EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that's horrible. How do you feel about it?  EOS 3 0 5 I feel lost. I'm so used to her being around everyday. Now I don't know what to do with myself without her.  EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word.  EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year  EOS 3 0 8 Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it.  EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Do you have any family?  EOS 3 0 10 Yes, i do, but they are far away.  EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Friends closeby?  EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Hobbies?  EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] What kind of work do you do?  EOS 3 0 14 I do have friends, who are also friends with her. However they have families and do not visit prople because of covid.  EOS 3 0 15 I don't have any true hobbies. I don't think they will fill the void anyways.  EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow.  EOS 3 0 17 I do software development, but its a work at home situation. So i have been just by myself for the last week, and its driving me crazy. All i do is think about why she would do that.  EOS 3 0 18 I've had time to myself but its not getting any better.  EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn't seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering.  EOS 3 0 20 What positive are there here?  EOS 3 1 21 [Question] I'm actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it?  EOS 3 1 22 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren't hurting for money.  EOS 3 0 23 It's ok. pays the bills. But my job is pretty independent. so i don't even get to meet new people. I am usually home, while she was always out of the house during the day.  EOS 3 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] You can use that stress that has been building up to find a new outlet for the stress.  EOS 3 0 25 what, you want to break stuff to relieve stress  EOS 3 1 26 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. My wife used to think I was just playing on the computer all day, lol.

Sometimes even when you want to take more on emotionally and mentally you need to take a step back and re-evaluate the situation.  EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe finding someone to talk to about everything that is currently going on in your life would be helpful.

EOS 4 0 3 I don't think it, I guess I actually know she is. She use to have a heroin problem and went on methadone. She has since started taking anxiety medicine in order to get high.  EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Thats a tough spot to be in, ive actually been both sides of that coin.  EOS 4 0 5 I think I know what I need to do, It is just hard.  EOS 4 1 6 [Information] It is hard. Unfortunately you can only try to direct them to stop for so long before it can really damage your own well being, which should come first.  EOS 4 0 7 I agree, and after going through this in the past with her, I just can't sit and wait for the train crash. she feels like she is doing nothing wrong because she has valid prescriptions.  EOS 4 0 8 I feel like I should just cut her off completely, I don't have time for her drama. What do you suggest?  EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] I would actually suggest just that. If you have tried, or do not even feel like going down that path. Then that is your decision. You should look out for yourself!  EOS 4 0 10 True, I definitely do not need to be caught up in her mess. I have too much to lose. I just feel bad like i am abandoning her.  EOS 4 1 11 [Others] The thing is with drugs, that person already abandoned themselves. Sometimes they can get the help they need, but they need to do it on their own terms. Its kind of like a blackhole where everything gets sucked into their life.  EOS 4 0 12 True, I know she has to want to help herself.  EOS 4 0 13 I hate this disease.  EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Me too, i dont know how many bridges i burned all those years ago.  EOS 4 0 15 Probably a lot, hopefully you made amends. I will talk to her and tell her I am here for her if she decides to get clean.  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Thats really all you can do.

Let's start with things that interest you. What do you like doing for fun?  EOS 4 0 2 I don't really know anymore, nothing makes me happy these days.  EOS 4 0 3 I used to like reading a lot but it's become a chore.  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] And what kinds of things did you like to read?  EOS 4 0 5 Mostly fiction books. Fantasy, historical novels, contemporary fiction, anything really.  EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] That's really great! I used to struggle with finding joy in reading as well. I was a graduate student at the time so I was mostly reading research papers.  EOS 4 0 7 Do you like reading again? What helped?  EOS 4 1 8 [Question] Have you tried picking up a new hobby? Something you have always thought might be fun but haven't ever tried because of lack of time or energy?  EOS 4 0 9 I wanted to try rock climbing, but I don't know. I'm not really in the best shape.  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I do like reading now. I took some time after school to take care of my mental health by going on walks and being in nature. Overtime, I started to pick up books again. I've found I really like true crime and autobiographies the best  EOS 4 0 11 I feel like people will just make fun of me.  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Rock climbing is so fun! Have you tried taking a beginners course? I started there. I was very nervous I would be made fun of, but found that it was a really supportive community.  EOS 4 0 13 I guess I can give it a try.  EOS 4 0 14 But I don't know if it will be enough.  EOS 4 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You might find it's just the community of people that you need right now. From my experience, they were all super friendly and open to helping me along the way.  EOS 4 0 16 I guess you're right. I tend to get caught up in my own thoughts, which never have anything good to say about me.  EOS 4 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem like such a nice person. I don't think anyone would have mean things to say about you.  EOS 4 0 18 That's kind of you to say.  EOS 4 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] I really hope you'll take the leap to trying rock climbing! It was so fun for me when I did it and I can't wait to get back out there to learn more (hopefully COVID will be over soon!) :-)

I hope you are too.  EOS 3 0 5 Yes. I feel like I have to change my plans for my career when I thought I had everything figured out and it feels really depressing.  EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I actually understand that feeling a lot. I had to switch careers really recently.  EOS 3 1 7 [Information] Do you like the new path you've chosen for yourself?  EOS 3 0 8 I actually haven't chosen yet. I feel overwhelmed with options and I'm lacking direction.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Okay thats completely normal!  EOS 3 1 10 [Question] What are your interests/what do you like to do? Thats a good starting question  EOS 3 0 11 Maybe another path involving animals.

EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I understand, you feel like your losing everyone close to you and wondering about your own mortality now as well?  EOS 0 0 5 Exactly, I worry about losing my aunts because they are in their 70s and 80s. I worry about my own mortality as well.  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Have you told your aunts how much you love them? It may comfort you to know that you've shared exactly how you feel with them while they are here.  EOS 0 0 7 I tell them every time I talk to them and try to spend as much time with them as I can.  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I try to let everyone know I love them too just because we never know when we aren't going to be here anymore. I definitely understand where you are coming from.  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] Have you tried looking at any YouTube videos about life and mortality?  EOS 0 0 10 I agree! We never know  EOS 0 0 11 I haven't but I will check some out. I love You Tube but never thought to look there.  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I personally have found some comfort in hearing other people struggle with their own mortality or their beliefs in an after life or different things. Maybe that could be something you could try looking into.  EOS 0 0 13 I will definitely try that. It makes me feel better to know that you have found some comfort in hearing other people's struggles with their mortality or beliefs.  EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds to me like you've felt alone in your struggles and you are not alone! Yes I have and I've heard from many others who have as well.

You have given me some great ideas, listened to me, and have made me feel better. I feel calm and relaxed now. Thank you so much!  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] I've personally enjoyed looking into all the different types of religions and spiritual beliefs from around the world. It's nice hearing about different beliefs on life and death.  EOS 0 0 21 I agree, the world would be a much better place if we could all lean on each other in times of need!

EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad  EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter.

EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it's too late.  EOS 4 0 3 That is exactly it. I broke up with him because I liked another person but then quickly realized that I made a mistake and it's too late. I want him back should I start calling and going to his house to beg?  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] nobody knows him better than you do, right now I do not think he is in a good place either since it wasn't his choice to end it, how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him?  EOS 4 0 5 I haven't really thought of that yet. He has a pretty short temper actually. I know he is really mad at me so I think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again.  EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response  EOS 4 0 7 Yeah, that's true. I have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and I don't want to let them get to him before I can get him back. I want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together.  EOS 4 1 8 [Question] you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk, so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way, with no yelling or arguing, do you think that's something he would do?  EOS 4 0 9 I can try that, I think he might be responsive at first if I dont set him off. All of his friends hate me so I have nobody on my side right now. Should I try to get his friends to like me again? Is that an way I could use to get him to want me again?  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] nobody likes to see that one's friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back

What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately?  EOS 3 0 6 My ex-husband is moved in with his new girlfriend. They might get married.  EOS 3 1 7 [Information] Oh Keri, that must feel awful. Was it a recent separation between you two?  EOS 3 0 8 He started dating a few months after we split up. I don't know if this is the only person he's dated but I think so. He really moved on quick.  EOS 3 0 9 Hi, are you still there?

[contxt]	3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened?  EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS (its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family.  EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct?  EOS 3 0 4 Yes that is correct  EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It's like living alone in the forest.  EOS 3 0 6 I know I'm not alone and that's what makes it hard to reach out, because I don't want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there's. It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect.  EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do.  EOS 3 1 8 [Others] It seems that you don't want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person.  EOS 3 0 9 I just don't know what to do about it anymore  EOS 3 0 10 Yes, I don't like to bother others or let other people down  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure.  EOS 3 1 12 [Others] Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief?  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think?  EOS 3 0 14 It is a lot, I'm used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself. I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease. I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started.  EOS 3 0 15 Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief  EOS 3 1 16 [Others] I'm sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now.  EOS 3 0 17 I'd be open to doing Yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity.  EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I know. Sunshine is always best cure for a better mood. Did you try to maybe walk or drive around your neighborhood for some fresh air?  EOS 3 1 19 [Others] Oh, then drive around might be the only option  EOS 3 0 20 I'm hoping to get out and go for walks once the weather warms up, unfortunately right now there is still some snow on the ground and it's not quite warn yet being in the northeast  EOS 3 1 21 [Others] Ye.

Have you had a conversation with her about her actions and how they have made you feel?  EOS 0 0 15 She knew pretty well how I felt.  EOS 0 0 16 I don't want to have anything to do with her again.  EOS 0 1 17 [Question] Do you feel that her actions and result can be remedied? Or is this such a fundamental break that you cannot reconcile?  EOS 0 0 18 I just want to move on with my life.  EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] Understandable. I would feel similar, in truth.  EOS 0 0 20 I don't that I can love her again.  EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Only you know whether or not if you can look to forgiving and moving forward or if this is such a fundamental break that it is not something you can mend.  EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] And if you know that this is not something you wish to move forward with her that doesn’t make you a bad person. It means you are taking care of yourself first.  EOS 0 0 23 Yes, I want someone that I could trust.  EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Absolutely. Trust is to me a cornerstone of healthy relationships.

Dont give up, staying positive and open minded to new opportunities will help you find work.  EOS 3 0 8 Not sure how to manage mortgage payments and credit card bills : (  EOS 3 1 9 [Information] i see.i would call the companies themselves and see if they have programs in place to help you.  EOS 3 0 10 That's a nice idea. I will call the bank to see if they provide mortgage holiday  EOS 3 1 11 [Information] At least they might give extensions.  EOS 3 0 12 Can you elaborate on extensions please ? Not sure what it is ?  EOS 3 1 13 [Others] Also there are people willing to help sometimes in local places.

I will give them a call and check. What does going to town hall mean ?  EOS 3 1 16 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Going to the town hall means phsyically going to your local town hall asking for help for assistance. There should within have programs you can apply for.

EOS 0 0 7 well money as in like salaries later on  EOS 0 0 8 tuition fees aren't an issue im in canada and all  EOS 0 0 9 but like architects generally make more money than mechanical engineers on average  EOS 0 0 10 so they don't approve my career path  EOS 0 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh i see. so you mean that your parents would prefer you to choose the path that will eventually give you a higher salary?  EOS 0 0 12 yeah exactly!

EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] i went through a similar experience during my schooling, and i had to explain to my parents that i don't want to disappoint them but i still have to do what makes me happy. having a career that you hate doesn't feel good - i've been there  EOS 0 1 18 [Information] but there can be careers in engineering that have connections to architecture as well, such as structural engineering  EOS 0 0 19 yeah i agree  EOS 0 0 20 it's much more suitable if i could mix up the details of each career paths  EOS 0 0 21 but frankly i don't think my parents should be concerned with engineering either  EOS 0 0 22 it pays well and provides good stability  EOS 0 0 23 but like they said architecture suits my strengths more and i can go further with it  EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] honestly i think both are great career paths to pursue and as you said, both are stable and well-paying fields  EOS 0 1 25 [Information] strengths doesn't always equal happiness though, so that's a tough one.  EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] have you considered speaking with both architects and engineers to learn more about each job? that might be helpful in your decision. sometimes what we think a job does, in actuality can be totally different in real life  EOS 0 0 27 yeah!  EOS 0 0 28 i went on reddit to ask students in my desired uni  EOS 0 0 29 and they all said that what they are doing is what you expect  EOS 0 0 30 architects said it's a booming business in Toronto  EOS 0 0 31 engineers is always in demand, but not growing  EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ah well i commend you on taking that step and actually trying to learn about the jobs. you seem like a really smart person and you're able to see things from a logical perspective  EOS 0 0 33 thank you i've done the research to dispute my parents' arguments you see  EOS 0 0 34 but like-  EOS 0 0 35 utimately its about how much i like it o not  EOS 0 0 36 *or  EOS 0 1 37 [Providing Suggestions] i think what you need to do is take that same logical approach and explain calmly to your parents the path you want to take. just because they think your strengths are suited for architecture, doesnt mean you don't also have the strengths for engineering. many of the same skills are probably required for both jobs, and you're right: ultimately it is about what will make you happy

EOS 0 0 5 It's a lot that is on my plate on top of the other things that I'm responsible for.  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Alot of parents are experiencing the same difficulty, even I am experiencing trouble with my child. It is a lot of alien stress to us when, in the past, we were only responsible for ensuring that homework is done.  EOS 0 0 7 I agree with you there. It would be nice if they could be in school, but I understand that they shouldn't be.  EOS 0 0 8 I'd like more help and understanding from my husband, but he seems to be incapable of that.  EOS 0 0 9 Unless I badger him for it.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It's kind of a tired saying, but one strategy that has helped me is the One day at a time strategy. I'm sure you've heard of it. Basically, it means just do for today, don't worry about yesterday, don't stress over tomorrow, just treat this day as it's own task.  EOS 0 0 11 I've definitely heard that before, but you are completely right. I need to stop worrying about yesterday and tomorrow and focus on today, but I'm just not very good at that.  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Then, within that, one task at a time. Segment things he wants to do then reward him with them upon successful completion of school-tasks.  EOS 0 0 13 Yea, I definitely need to get better at doing that. I end up letting them play video games and with toys in the middle of the day sometimes because I have work that I have to get done as well.  EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] For my example, my daughter very much likes to play video games. In order to earn video game time I need two successful assignments.

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hello there.  EOS 4 1 1 [Others] Hello, how can I help you today?  EOS 4 0 2 I'm having a bit of a bad time at the moment. I've been with my partner for 2 years she's great. unfortunately my feelings for her changed and we broke up recently. the problem is I think I've made a big mistake and worry that she's moved on with her life  EOS 4 1 3 [Question] OK, thanks for explaining. Can I ask what makes you think she has moved on with her life? how recently did you guys split up?  EOS 4 0 4 About three months ago. I have started to miss her badly. I saw her with another guy when I was out at the supermarket at the weekend. She lives near me so I wasn't surprised but I don't know who this guy is.  EOS 4 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So to clarify, you ended things and think this wasn't the right thing to do. You have seen her with someone else and now you think you want her back.  EOS 4 0 6 Yeah that's right. I can't believe she has moved on so quickly.  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Can I ask, for how long have you thought you have made a mistake by ending things. was it when you saw her with someone else?  EOS 4 0 8 I must admit it was only when I saw her with someone else that I started to really miss her. do you think I'm just feeling jealous because we were so close and now I've seen her with someone else?  EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I had a friend who was in a very similar situation to this. he was in a long term relationship with a girl for 5-years. they split up and stayed friends. It was only when he saw her with someone else that he decided he wanted to give things another go.  EOS 4 0 10 I think you might be right actually. I didn't really miss her until I saw her with someone else. is this normal I don't know what to do about this?  EOS 4 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] I'd say this is completely normal. I can tell by talking to you that you did have strong feelings for this person once and seeing her with someone else has made you remember the good times.  EOS 4 0 12 Well that's good to know. I'm not normally the jealous type but I suppose we did have good times and I want her to be happy I suppose. I do think I've made a mistake though now I've thought about it!  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can tell you are a caring person and really do care about your ex-girlfriend happiness. I'm sure you will do the right thing but you need to think of yourself.  EOS 4 0 14 do you think I should try and get in touch with her and tell her how I feel?  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I think you need to think carefully about what you really want. If you feel like this then I would suggest you do talk to her about it, however you may be best talking it through with a friend or family member first 
[reference_response]	i think you need to think carefully about what you really want. if you feel like this then i would suggest you do talk to her about it, however you may be best talking it through with a friend or family member first

[contxt]	3 0 5 I don't even know where to start.  EOS 3 0 6 I'm trying to decide if I can build trust with him again.  EOS 3 0 7 He lied about everything.  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Well, let's try to take it one problem at a time so's not to get overwhelmed. What is your biggest problem at the moment?  EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Ah, am I to take it that a relationship has recently ended?  EOS 3 0 10 When we met, before we got involved, he said he was divorced. I ended up finding out that he was still legally married. He assured me that they were just a pen's stroke away from being divorced.  EOS 3 0 11 That was in March.  EOS 3 0 12 I found out three weeks ago that they're actually still living together.  EOS 3 0 13 ANd, no. We haven't broken up yet.  EOS 3 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Ah I totally hear you .. the old 'we're getting divorced' line. I've been in that one! You are well out of this.  EOS 3 0 15 I'm debating. I don't know what to do.  EOS 3 0 16 I feel like a schmuck.  EOS 3 0 17 He has such pretty words.  EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] From personal experience I think that if they say they're going to get divorced and then drag their feet it is never going to happen.  EOS 3 0 19 And he invests so much time and effort into us.  EOS 3 0 20 I agree with you.  EOS 3 0 21 My mind agrees.  EOS 3 0 22 My stupid emotions are clouding things.  EOS 3 1 23 [Others] Well, if you were to give him an ultimatum what do you think he would say?  EOS 3 0 24 I did.  EOS 3 0 25 LOL  EOS 3 1 26 [Question] And he's still married?  EOS 3 0 27 And he brought his kids to my house so they could meet my kids. He had a conversation with them about why he and their mother had been living the way they had. (in seperate floors of the house)  EOS 3 0 28 That was two weeks ago.  EOS 3 0 29 So, yes, he is.  EOS 3 0 30 Too soon to tell.  EOS 3 1 31 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you feel that you are being cheated here. I can't tell you what to do but don't you think you deserve better?  EOS 3 0 32 I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out. Should I give him time to prove himself now that he's backed into a corner.  EOS 3 1 33 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's not for me to say but I wonder if he's really going to change as he has not already.  EOS 3 0 34 That's not an easy question to answer. He treats me very well. Always has. And he is frantically trying to accomodate me, now htat I know.  EOS 3 0 35 I agree with you. It's one of my fears.  EOS 3 1 36 [Question] How do your children feel about this? And his?  EOS 3 0 37 MY children (6 and 9) have been living with him in their lives as a male figure who is growing into a father figure. He and I have been together for fifteen months, and part-time living together for six.  EOS 3 0 38 This isn't a new relationship. That's part of the complication, too.  EOS 3 0 39 His kids actually asked if they could come live with me while he and his (ex?) figured their shit out.  EOS 3 1 40 [Question] Yes, I can imagine that it is. It is always really difficult when children are involved. I know you would not want your children to be hurt  EOS 3 0 41 It's a messed up situation that COVID has not improved. He was furloughed in May.  EOS 3 0 42 Indeed I don't, you're right.  EOS 3 1 43 [Self-disclosure] I hear you. Covid has disrupted the whole world so might this year! I can't wait for it to be over.

[contxt]	3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. I have struggled to deal with depression most of my life, so I know it can be debilitating, but I have found ways to help myself.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Is there a specific problem making you depressed, or life in general?  EOS 3 0 7 I'd love to hear them. There is one problem in general i'm having that i seem to have always had because of the Depression. I have an extremely difficult time falling asleep.. and whenever I do manage to fall asleep.. i wake up always feeling like crap. I never feel rested no matter how long i sleep.  EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I have had trouble sleeping in the past and sometimes I still do, usually if it is when I'm nervous about the future.  EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] The number one way I have had to help my depression is to pray and read scripture. I don't know if you are a Christian, but that has helped me a lot. The second way is to have a good friend who will listen, not someone who will TELL me what to do or judge me, but someone who can empathize with me. A good listener is worth her weight in gold.  EOS 3 0 10 I've learned that mines not really an emotional thing. I feel like my sleeping issue causes my depression. Because no matter what- i always feel exhausted. Nothing has helped it besides medication. It just sucks always feeling fatigued and energyless. I actually did take up religion here this year to help with the coping that comes with this. It was very helpful for a while there  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If I didn't get good rest, then I would definitely feel tired the next day and over time, it would wear me out. I believe medication will help with the symptoms, but it is important to get the root of the problem, why exactly you find it difficult to sleep.  EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes I take a benydryl because they always make me sleepy, but I usually know why I need to relax, I'm nervous about the next day. So I have found it important to know WHY I don't rest well, if that makes sense to you.  EOS 3 0 13 I plan on seeing a sleep doctor soon! Sometimes I lose sight of fixing the issue and need to be reminded. And yes!! I was treating my sleeping with Benadryl as well but it wasn't healthy to keep doing that.  EOS 3 1 14 [Others] I'm also thinking there are a few practical ways you can help yourself sleep. I was advised to get soft sheets, make my sleeping area more restful, make sure the time before bed is relaxing and calming.  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] I also was helped a lot by a Christian Preacher, he's long dead, but he has audio on youtube -- Frank Hammond, Pigs in the Parlor. It's a 5 part series I found helpful, you might want to jot that down. And I do encourage you to find a counselor, once you rule out the physical (doctor) then you can look at emotional, mental and/or spiritual. I think most of everything is spiritual and emotional to some degree, and our body just responds to that.  EOS 3 0 16 I always lose sight of how to make things better. It really helps to talk sometimes so someone can help me put things into perspective. I'll look into Frank Hammond! I am actually religious and would love to look into that.  EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I will definitely pray for you tonight because I know losing sleep is hard to deal with. But please have hope, sometimes we go through these things to possible get to deeper issues that might need to be dealt with. We only have a few minutes here, but I'm pretty old and I have found this to be true so many times. Get a good support system of good friends. Having people who "get" you is SO vital to our lives. And learning to be grateful helps too. And especially journal, find out what may be bothering you.  EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I had some abuse issues and that is why I had a hard time resting. I also would wake up in the middle of the night and obsess over problems with people. I had a lot to work through, but most nights, I sleep restful now. It may take time.  EOS 3 1 19 [Others] I have hope for you! :D 
[reference_response]	i have hope for you! d
[hypothesis_response]	i've been through some similar things. i have learned to be more grateful for myself. i am grateful for my parents who have been around my life and know exactly how to help me.

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk?  EOS 4 1 1 [Others] Hello, how can i help you today?  EOS 4 0 2 I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse.  EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age?  EOS 4 0 4 He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia.  EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough, both for you and him. I know it's meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he's not in a better place  EOS 4 0 6 I presume you mean now and not not ;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was.  EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn't it? I sometimes think it's meaningless too  EOS 4 0 8 I do not really know what to do about my feelings. They are not going away.  EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy. In fact, it's confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on  EOS 4 0 10 Do you think that people ever really recover from a significant bereavement?  EOS 4 0 11 I think that what you said there was very wise. Maybe it's worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened .. there is guilt that comes with that.  EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don't think people can completely get over that, you just get used to the pain of not having them around  EOS 4 0 13 Whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, I think that it would hurt more if I had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day.

EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I'm sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don't have any job for a long time now  EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills.  EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] have u check for job vacancy in your state  EOS 0 0 7 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk.  EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well  EOS 0 0 9 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing (which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all.  EOS 0 0 10 I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job.  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out  EOS 0 0 12 What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood.  EOS 0 0 13 Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships.  EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that's a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it  EOS 0 0 15 Thank you. I believe there are three things in my favor: I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current (related) job fifteen years ago.  EOS 0 1 16 [Information] even by working there, you will surely meet new friends. do you know many people from the church?

EOS 2 0 4 Yes, so I have always done very well in school and university. I have always had A's or high B's. Last semester in university, I failed one of my exams. I still passed the class with an A, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams.  EOS 2 0 5 I don't know why it happens and it worries me  EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!!  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself?  EOS 2 0 8 Maybe, I got a 46% on the exam (so an F) but I did all my other assignments and exams almost perfect and got an A overall. I never once failed a test in my life, and have always held myself to a very high academic degree to make my parents proud  EOS 2 0 9 I come from a poor family, so succeeding in life is very important to m,e  EOS 2 0 10 me*  EOS 2 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life, would I be right in thinking this?

I dont know that I can move on after giving him up  EOS 3 1 14 [Others] Would you ever consider getting a pet that is not as loud? I am not suggesting that you replace him.  EOS 3 0 15 No, except a seeing dog  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] I am concerned that if you don't have a pet to care for you may have a more difficult time to recover and thrive.

[contxt]	4 1 3 [Question] I'm so sorry to hear that :( Do you have any idea why?  EOS 4 0 4 I think she just lost interest in me? It happened a couple of months ago. I wish I could get over it. I can't get her off my mind. She's dating this total loser.  EOS 4 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That's tough... so you're saying that you grew apart a little? Or do you think it was more one-sided?  EOS 4 0 6 It probably was more me than her. Maybe I should have done more to show her that I cared for her. Am I not romantic enough? Some guys just aren't that way.  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I completely understand, and I don't think you should beat yourself up over it!  EOS 4 0 8 That's a fair point. I shouldn't be too hard on myself. I didn't really grow up in a romantic family. I don't know how to do that stuff, but maybe I could learn.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Exactly, and remember everyone is different, perhaps you just weren't her right one, and that can go both ways.  EOS 4 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Do you want to improve for her? or for yourself do you think?  EOS 4 0 11 That's true. I really got hung up on her. I thought she was perfect and that we were perfect together. She didn't see it that way. I can't really change who I am, and she couldn't change who she is.  EOS 4 0 12 I don't know if I can change myself for her. Maybe there is something basic that she wants that I just don't have? I should probably change for future relationships.  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's a great line of thought, its good that you're able to identify that yourself  EOS 4 0 14 What do you think I could do to improve myself?  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I suggest that you stay exactly the way that you are. I feel like you'd be happier that way and also more likely to find someone who shares the same values as you  EOS 4 1 16 [Others] If you change who you are, it sort of means that your ex still has a hold on you, you know?  EOS 4 0 17 Will the same problems show up in the next relationship though? It could be a long search before I find someone that matches with me?  EOS 4 0 18 That's true. But I feel like I should take away something from this experience.  EOS 4 1 19 [Question] I guess that depends on you, would you rather compromise for a relationship or find one who'll really last and not have to change?  EOS 4 0 20 I think all relationships require compromise and change. No two people are perfectly compatible.  EOS 4 0 21 I worry that I have blind spots that I should fix. My ex-GF didn't really specify what the problem was.  EOS 4 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's true, building on that, you could also say that what your ex found to be the problem is not the be-all end-all. What your ex disliked could be what 10000 other girls love in a guy  EOS 4 0 23 That's true. I might end up trying to solve a problem that really isn't there. It's not a bug, it's a feature! :-)  EOS 4 1 24 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow, you put that really nicely!  EOS 4 0 25 Thanks! You’ve been really helpful today.

EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] When I got cheated on by my ex, I took time to build my self confidence up, build my happiness up, I wrote a letter telling him how it hurt and every feeling and then I ripped it up and threw it away it felt good getting my feelings out. it might help you to.

[contxt]	3 0 0 Hello. Is anyone here?  EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hello  EOS 3 0 2 I need a bit of advice  EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, what is going on?  EOS 3 0 4 My partner of 4 years... i never thought this would happen but they ended up cheating on me  EOS 3 0 5 Caught them in the act  EOS 3 0 6 With my roommate  EOS 3 0 7 I can't believe this. We've been together for 4 years. All of their stuff is in the same house we are living in  EOS 3 0 8 Should I kick them out???  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am truly sorry you had to witness that. Would you feel more comfortable with them leaving or do you think either relationship is salvagable?  EOS 3 0 10 That's my current problem. I do still love them but... what would happen if I stay and we work on our relationship?  EOS 3 0 11 Do you think it would be a good idea to solve the relationship and stay?  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] If you feel that something might be salvageable it might be worth looking into. Do you think they'd be open to sitting down and talking it out?  EOS 3 0 13 They did end up crying and saying that it was a mistake. I don't know if it would be a good idea. I think I would have feelings of regret  EOS 3 0 14 The trust wouldn't be there anymore.  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] I think that either way you choose to proceed there is always the choice of remaining amicable. You're all adults, so sitting down and discussing what comes next is an inevitability. Maybe they will choose to leave, or you'll decide it would be better for you to go, but at least the discussion would be ongoing to perhaps resume the friendship at a later time?  EOS 3 0 16 I'll give it a shot to talk with them. Do you think there would be hateful feelings even if we decided to resume the friendship?  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] If you're trying your best to move on and the other party ends up with hateful feelings then I feel like at least you gave it your best right? It might be worth laying low for a little while to sort through the feelings of mistrust and betrayal. 
[reference_response]	if you're trying your best to move on and the other party ends up with hateful feelings then i feel like at least you gave it your best right? it might be worth laying low for a little while to sort through the feelings of mistrust and betrayal.

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hello.  EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here.  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you?  EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night.  EOS 4 0 4 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now.  EOS 4 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well?  EOS 4 0 6 Today was my one-year anniversary with my boyfriend.  EOS 4 0 7 He broke up with me today.  EOS 4 0 8 We were at school (our college campus), and we had a huge fight.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run.  EOS 4 0 10 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don't know what to do with myself.  EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation.  EOS 4 0 12 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately.  EOS 4 0 13 That's true, but that doesn't make me feel any better about it right now.  EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress.  EOS 4 0 15 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays.  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts?  EOS 4 0 17 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate.  EOS 4 0 18 I suppose I just need to practice more.  EOS 4 1 19 [Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind.  EOS 4 0 20 Like the Calm app?  EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma.  EOS 4 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, the Calm app is one.  EOS 4 0 23 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately.  EOS 4 0 24 What else can I do besides meditation?  EOS 4 1 25 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds?  EOS 4 0 26 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick.  EOS 4 0 27 Candles are much better for me.  EOS 4 1 28 [Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil.  EOS 4 0 29 I haven't heard of that website before. I'll have to check it out.  EOS 4 1 30 [Providing Suggestions] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships. 
[reference_response]	i used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships.

EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me  EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven't personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have.  EOS 6 1 7 [Question] How long were you together?  EOS 6 0 8 four years  EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being together that long must have made that break up difficult. How are you coping with it?  EOS 6 0 10 well I'm not really, especially as she'd gone off with someone else. But I'm to blame which makes it worse  EOS 6 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened?  EOS 6 0 12 I cheated on her on a drunken night. It was a one-off and I regret it terribly. But she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain.

[contxt]	0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] Hello!  EOS 0 0 2 I'm dealing with a lot of frustration and anxiety.  EOS 0 1 3 [Question] How are you?  EOS 0 0 4 Frustrated and anxious  EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I understand how that can be.  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Would you like to tell me about it?  EOS 0 0 7 Ok. I have a friend who I've known a long time, who is one of my closest friends, but who is extremely insecure. She constantly seeks affirmation that I love and care for her, even though she should KNOW I do, since we have been friends for so long.  EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can understand how that can become a source of frustration after a while.  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] Would you like to share what pushed it beyond the normal point today?  EOS 0 0 10 It's just been an ongoing thing that has escalated recently because she's so afraid and timid and doesn't believe anyone could really love or care for her. I get sick of having to say that of course I love her.  EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I can relate because I also have a close friend that seeks constant reaffirmations.  EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Have you spoken with her about this?  EOS 0 0 13 I have. I address it every time it comes up. She always sells herself short. Recently I suggested she could babysit my kids, she agreed, then almost immediately said it was ok if I had someone better in mind, and didn't want her, even though I had asked her!  EOS 0 0 14 do you talk to your friend about it?  EOS 0 1 15 [Information] Sometimes it is very difficult to see yourself through someone elses eyes when you undervalue yourself.  EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] I know it may be difficult to remain patient when your friend repeatedly does this, but maybe you could explain to her that it makes you feel like she is mistrustful of your opinion when she second guesses your taste in friends.  EOS 0 0 17 Yes, I know. Until she finds her self worth, it doesn't matter what any of her friends say to her.  EOS 0 0 18 I have actually told her that. That it seems like she doesn't trust me.  EOS 0 1 19 [Others] Possibly explaining it in a way she can relate to would be helpful.  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] I did in fact speak with my friend and it helped our relationship quite a bit. We continue to be very close 20 years later.  EOS 0 0 21 It's frustrating to me and gives me anxiety because I wish I could change her to see herself the way I, and others, do. But I know I can't make her see her self worth. That's something she has to find for herself.  EOS 0 0 22 That's good to hear about you and your friend.  EOS 0 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I can feel your frustration just by our conversation, and I too wish that she could see that you value both her and your friendship enough to reach out to someone that can just listen. Don't forget that your feelings are valid as well.  EOS 0 0 24 I know they are. And yes, she's dealing with a lot, but we all are, and it would be so much better for her if she could trust the people who love her to actually love her.  EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes you have to take a step back and fill your own cup.  EOS 0 0 26 Indeed. Thank you for your input.  EOS 0 1 27 [Question] Do you think a break would help you feel better able to deal with the demands of her friendship?

[contxt]	0 0 1 Hello  EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you?  EOS 0 0 3 I'm pretty stressed out actually  EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. It's rough to get stressed  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Would you like to tell me what's going on?  EOS 0 0 6 Sure. I just failed a huge test in my college class, and I'm worried it will fail me the entire class, and then I won't be able to get my associates  EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh no! I can totally understand why you're stressing over that! Absolutely valid reason for anxiety.  EOS 0 1 8 [Question] May I ask how much of the whole grade was the test's percentage?  EOS 0 0 9 Yeah it's really weighing down on me. It's the only thing I can think about. The test was worth 75%  EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What was you're score?  EOS 0 0 11 I got a 62% on the test.  EOS 0 1 12 [Others] That isn't TECHNICALLY a failed grade by the standards of most professors. Albeit a low grade, it's a D. Anything below 59% would qualify as failed.  EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, but taking into account my scores on homework, I don't think it's enought to pass the class  EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Have you done fairly well in other classes? How have your grades been prior to this test in that class?  EOS 0 0 15 Honestly it's just kind of all over the place. I am surviving in other classes, but with all this online stuff with the pandemic I barely learn anything. I'm basically faking it til I make it. Which I hate. But I can't learn in these conditions.  EOS 0 1 16 [Others] I hate that you feel that way about yourself, but I can also relate to having a rough time learning via online classes. I'm the same way. However, that does not disable you from being able to learn. It impedes your quality of learning, no doubt. But it isn't something that YOU can help.  EOS 0 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] By having an attitude of being unable to learn, you automatically lower your expectations for the success you would potentially have otherwise...  EOS 0 0 18 Yeah that's true, I just think it's not my learning style so it's a lot harder for me.

And I do know my mom is working from home now and she's a really social person. It's probably getting to her too.  EOS 0 1 32 [Others] if that's the case, you can use this chance to be there for her. I think talking to your mom will help you both  EOS 0 0 33 Yes, I'll probably call her and my dad tonight. I'll let them know I'm a bit sad and lonely, but not so much that they worry. And then I'll start planning my virtual party with my friends!  EOS 0 1 34 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sounds like a great plan.

EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I'm here to listen.  EOS 0 0 6 Since CORONA I have had to quit working my second job and become a full time stay at home parent.

EOS 0 0 11 I had been a stay at home parent before so our family was used to one income for a long time. It was nice to not always have to stress about money since I was working again. It seems the stress is a lot more now though because of everything going on in the country.  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Yes our country is in a lot of uncertainty right now. And having a second income always helps. Have you considered possibly finding a work from home job? Perhaps look at what skills you've developed, and update your resume to reflect the skills you have that will transfer over to a work from home job.  EOS 0 0 13 I'm always concerned about scams.

[contxt]	3 0 35 I shutdown from everything and feel worthless sometimes  EOS 3 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] I understand that shut down feeling....I close right up when I am down  EOS 3 0 37 I hate to feel like that but I feel there is nothing I can do sometimes  EOS 3 1 38 [Information] Feeling worthless, uninterested in going out, those are symptoms of depression, they will pass  EOS 3 0 39 I don't find fun in things I used to do that was fun  EOS 3 0 40 I feel so separated from people my parents both are gone now too  EOS 3 1 41 [Information] Lack of interest in things is also a symptom of depression. Once your depression lifts it will come back. I'll tell you what helped me when I was depresed...  EOS 3 0 42 My dad passed away 24 years ago and my mom passed away last easter too  EOS 3 0 43 what helped you?  EOS 3 1 44 [Providing Suggestions] I was taught to make very small goals. For example, I found it hard to go out for a walk, even though I knew it would help my depression. (Exercise has been shown to be as effective as antidpressants) So I was told, just walk around the block. If that's too much, walk to the corner. If that's too much, walk to the end f the driveway. If that's too much, step outside. If that's too much, put your shoes on. Baby steps.  EOS 3 1 45 [Providing Suggestions] And whatever small step you manage to acheive, celebrate it and reward yourself.  EOS 3 0 46 I would like to know because I don't like the feeling of depression and anxiety not being able to sleep  EOS 3 1 47 [Self-disclosure] Ultimately, my last depression it was getting my covid shot that helped most....lifted a bunch of fear and anxiety and restored my hope.  EOS 3 1 48 [Question] Does your specialist know you are this down?  EOS 3 0 49 I try to go out and walk my wife likes to go outside so I try to do that but I still feel so down and I don't like how I feel I have become I get angry all the time too I feel like  EOS 3 0 50 Yes my specialist knows and I have appointments with them more often  EOS 3 1 51 [Affirmation and Reassurance] And losing your mum last Easter, you are probably still dealing with grief on top of everything else. My parents are gone too, grief can be a long process. Grief is tough. That will get easier with time.  EOS 3 0 52 My meds I take have been increased and I hate to just take meds to try to help  EOS 3 1 53 [Information] The thing is though, depression is an illness. Would you take meds for another sort of illness, something physical?  EOS 3 0 54 It has been 24 years since my dad has passed away and he was my best friend and I still hurt everyday  EOS 3 1 55 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is hard, I'm sorry you are hurting  EOS 3 1 56 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried writing down your thoughts and feelings in a journal?  EOS 3 0 57 I know and I try to get out but after I retired from military I still have thoughts about all that I seen there too and I hate that  EOS 3 1 58 [Question] okay so the PTSD is related to time in the military?  EOS 3 0 59 I don't like to tell everyone about that because I feel like I am bringing everyone down saying that too  EOS 3 0 60 Yes the PTSD is from the military time  EOS 3 1 61 [Providing Suggestions] Are there any veterans groups in your area that help with that?  EOS 3 1 62 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe connecting with others "in the same boat" would help  EOS 3 0 63 I am not sure but I don't like to be in big groups either  EOS 3 1 64 [Providing Suggestions] Or maybe there is a way online you could do that, virtual meetings, since you find it hard to get out. Could you handle a zoom group meeting?  EOS 3 0 65 I get easily startled now too when I am outside I always feel like someone is coming close to me and no one is there  EOS 3 1 66 [Self-disclosure] I attend zoom group meetings for my mental health. They have helped.  EOS 3 0 67 I am not sure about that I feel ashamed a lot too about the way I feel  EOS 3 1 68 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are going through a lot, but you are stronger than you feel, I know you can get through this. Things will get easier.

[contxt]	3 1 8 [Question] That sounds really bad. I once worked in a company that placed unnecessary pressure on me, with a low pay. I can relate to how you feel. Do you have to depend on this company for work?  EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Sometimes it's really not worth working somewhere if it's really affecting your mental health.  EOS 3 0 10 They are paying me well but It is hard to take the load beside I have family and kids responsibility. I don't have time for them.  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I understand. But I want you to think about this. Your mental health is more important right now because it is affecting you. And how you feel really affects those around you, especially the ones who love you. If you take some time to think about what is more important to you in life right now can help you make a decision.  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Working so hard can be a barrier right now. But you may have a bright future plan ahead. If so, that is something you want to look forward to.  EOS 3 1 13 [Others] I know what you are doing is really helping your family. And I know they really appreciate it, even if they don't say it.  EOS 3 0 14 I can understand that. But my job is really important right now as my partner lost his in COVID. and he is not doing anything right now not even helping at home. It makes me more low and it is hard to take care of 3 younger kids who are staying at home full time.  EOS 3 1 15 [Question] Ok, I understand better now. Thank you for explaining. What you are telling should to be something you need to discuss with your partner. Do both of you communicate well with each other? Maybe he is not aware of your situation or how you feel.  EOS 3 0 16 Nowadays he is so frustrated doesn't like to talk even. Whenever I bring household responsibilities or kids topic, he gets frustrated.  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] Oh no. I can see from his part he feels upset and frustrated because he may feel useless at the moment. But that's not an excuse to neglect responsibilities. You can maybe make him feel more useful around the house by starting to assign him small tasks. Encouraging him to do stuff and rewarding him with words of encouragement. I know it sounds kind of frustrating to do that, but maybe this small step on your half could also help him.  EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Do you have any family member that are close to you? If your partner isn't helpful, maybe seeking help from family can reduce your housework load.  EOS 3 0 19 Nobody lives near by. Kids are to young to understand. I felt bit good after talking to you. Thanks  EOS 3 1 20 [Self-disclosure] I'm sorry if this did not help the situation. But I'm always glad to listen if you want to talk more.  EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's a really tough situation, but you're a really strong individual. You've made it this far : )  EOS 3 0 22 Talking to you made me feel good. Thanks for listening to me. I am feeling light now. You are agreat help. Thank you so much  EOS 3 0 23 Hope all will come back on place soon  EOS 3 1 24 [Others] No problem.

[contxt]	3 1 40 [Self-disclosure] I couldn't agree more. Dealing with COVID on top of everything else has been extremely difficult for me. Honestly, I think it is part of what caused a lot of the issues that I'm currently dealing with.  EOS 3 0 41 I hope you're handling them okay. I'm generally well except for the whole breakup business. Still, I know I'm better off. It just sucks sometimes.  EOS 3 1 42 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It makes me happy to hear that you know that you're better off. I know it's sad, but accepting that a relationship wasn't meant to be is, in my opinion, the first step to truly getting over someone. A year is a long time to spend with one person.  EOS 3 0 43 I wish it was easier and okay to travel right now. A trip or a road trip would do me wonders.  EOS 3 0 44 So is five years! I hope everything works out for the best for you, too.  EOS 3 1 45 [Others] I completely agree! Where would you go if you were able to right now?  EOS 3 0 46 If there was no virus... maybe Scotland or Las Vegas to see some shows. Or up into Canada. (I'm in Pennsylvania.)  EOS 3 1 47 [Self-disclosure] Thank you so much! We broke up several months ago and I'm already feeling and doing so much better. I am also much better off without that person in my life. I've gained weight back that I couldn't really afford to lose to begin with, I've been more motivated, etc. It really was for the best even though the breakup itself was really difficult.  EOS 3 1 48 [Others] I live in Pennsylvania as well! It's such a small world!  EOS 3 0 49 My breakup was a few months ago too. I'm in the Poconos. :)  EOS 3 1 50 [Others] I've always wanted to go to Las Vegas. My brother and his girlfriend just took a trip out there not too long ago.  EOS 3 0 51 I've been to Las Vegas about fifteen times. I love it there. I eat, go to shows, go to baseball games... it's awesome.  EOS 3 1 52 [Others] Oh wow! I live right outside of Philadelphia. I have several friends who have houses on Lake Wallenpaupack. It's beautiful up there!  EOS 3 0 53 Wow, that's maybe an hour from me. I grew up outside of Reading. I live right by Blue Mountain.  EOS 3 1 54 [Others] That's so cool! I've never been on a plane and I've never been anywhere north or west of Pennsylvania. I've been in every state from PA down to Florida, but nowhere else. I really need to travel more!  EOS 3 1 55 [Providing Suggestions] That sounds like a beautiful area. Have you considered going skiing, snowboarding, or snow tubing since you live right near Blue Mountain?  EOS 3 0 56 Omg, yes. Travel! I've been to some really strange places. It's awesome. lol  EOS 3 1 57 [Others] I went snow tubing at Blue Mountain once. It was so much fun!  EOS 3 0 58 I haven't, but maybe I should! I teach, and I always have students who work there. lol  EOS 3 0 59 Come to think of it, they might sabotage my tube. lol  EOS 3 0 60 That's a really good idea though. Thanks. I always see groupons for tubing, too.  EOS 3 1 61 [Providing Suggestions] You should look into it! It was a lot of fun when I went. I believe they're still open right now even though COVID is still going on. It took my mind off of everything while I was there.  EOS 3 0 62 Yes, they are open. I got an email yesterday or today that they're making snow now.  EOS 3 1 63 [Others] Groupon is awesome! You're very welcome. I'm happy to help you think of things that you can do to make yourself feel better.  EOS 3 0 64 Let's go tubing! lol j/k  EOS 3 1 65 [Others] Wow! That's great to know! I might look into taking a trip up there myself with my daughter. She's 12 years old. She would absolutely love it!  EOS 3 0 66 I miss getting together with friends. And live music and live sports.

[contxt]	1 0 0 hello  EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how can I help you?  EOS 1 0 2 yes i had problems sleeping one night  EOS 1 0 3 i was so angry that i couldnt sleep  EOS 1 1 4 [Question] I am sorry to hear that. How often do you have problems sleeping?  EOS 1 0 5 i have them frequently when my neighbors are loud with their music.  EOS 1 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I hear you, I used to have noisy neighbours too.  EOS 1 1 7 [Question] How long have you been living next to your noisy neighbours for?  EOS 1 0 8 Its hard because they dont answer there door so i can tell them about the issue.  EOS 1 1 9 [Information] If noise levels are above the legal limit, you can get the police involved, however, its probably better to have that open conversation with them first. Let them have the opportunity to fix it before it escalates.  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried just a simple knock on the wall to let them know you are not happy?  EOS 1 1 11 [Others] Since they are not answering the door.  EOS 1 0 12 Unfotunately the police won't do anything about it because they know these neighbors are trouble. i even tried to communicate with the neighbor one day getting my mail.  EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] I would personally try to write a letter and post it through their door, give them 24 hours to be able to read it and think about it. If they continue to be noisy the next day, you should definitely call the police. The police are there for law and order, and it sounds as though they are causing a public nuisance which is what the police are there to do, no matter how troublesome your neighbours are. They aren't above the law.  EOS 1 0 14 i cannot write a letter because they will not understand since they dont speak english much,  EOS 1 0 15 Again, the police don't wat to get involved,  EOS 1 0 16 thank you for your input but i dont think i have anymore option but move and sell my house,  EOS 1 0 17 I just think that getting away from them would help  EOS 1 1 18 [Information] I understand you feel helpless, but I really think that is the last option. I don't know if you are saying the police will not help because this is what you have been told by a friend or this is your experience. But they really are there to help you in a case like this.  EOS 1 0 19 i have contactd the police they told me its not a problem the can fix  EOS 1 1 20 [Information] "Police typically are responsible for maintaining public order and safety, enforcing the law, and preventing, detecting, and investigating criminal activities. These functions are known as policing"  EOS 1 0 21 apparently none of the household members will open the door for the police  EOS 1 0 22 i will try again  EOS 1 0 23 thank you for all your help i hope you have a great day.  EOS 1 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] Then I would suggest if the police are not able to help you take the officers badge numbers and contact your local council or government,  EOS 1 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] No problem. I know your issue will be solved without having a move away. Have a great day too!

[contxt]	2 0 4 I have done the same job for 7 years but it is now full and boring. It pays OK but it is all I know. I'm scared that I will get resentful in this job if I stay where I am but I haven't got a clue what to do for the best.  EOS 2 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I see, so you feel that your position has become stagnant and you know longer take any pleasure in your work?  EOS 2 0 6 That's exactly it yes. The question is I don't have any official qualifications, just experience and I'd like a change of career but this scared me to death!  EOS 2 1 7 [Question] Are there any opportunities for advancement or retraining in your current position? Perhaps strive for a promotion?  EOS 2 0 8 Potentially yes but the position above me is not really like for me and I don't like the reporting line. I think I fancy a change but not quite sure how to tackle it. I need the income so can't just leave but also need to do something about it. do you understand the predicament?  EOS 2 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I do. I sympathise with you because it must be terrible to feel that you are stuck in something that you really no longer like and yet be afraid to try and change your situation. I am sure that there is some solution though!  EOS 2 0 10 Yeah meet too it's just finding a way where I can maybe stay where I am whilst exploring other opportunities to see what I'd like to do. It's a tough one.  EOS 2 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, you will never know unless you take the plunge into the unknown! I do realise how difficult it is for you to do that though. Perhaps start putting out feelers to other companies? There is no harm in that.  EOS 2 0 12 Sue that's actually a good idea. No harm I suppose and my current employer would be none the wiser.  EOS 2 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] True! it would also be great for your self esteem to realise just how much more there is out there that you could be doing.  EOS 2 0 14 I know, it is a big world out there and I have been doing the same thing for so long. It is exciting but also quite unnerving. Is this normal?  EOS 2 1 15 [Question] Yes, there is nothing to worry about. Do you have any relevant qualifications that might help you find another job?  EOS 2 0 16 I have experience and I am pretty hard-working. I have also made quite a few connections over the past 7 years.  EOS 2 1 17 [Question] It all sounds very promising. If you think they'd not tell your boss why don't you talk to some of your connections and see if they can put you onto something better?  EOS 2 0 18 Yeah reaching out to my network is probably a good idea - as long as they keep the fact that I am looking for something else quiet. I'd state on Linked in that I'm looking for work but then everyone would know :-)  EOS 2 1 19 [Question] One other suggestion - it's a high risk strategy but do you think your boss might be sympathetic if you discussed this with him or her? You never know, they might even have some good suggestions - perhaps they feel the same!  EOS 2 0 20 Actually you might be right there. I should be able to open up about this and they should be supporting my development. Great suggestion. I think I'm overthinking things.  EOS 2 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] No I do not believe that you are overthinking at all. This is a very important aspect of your life and will shape your future!

I can understand that you would be really stressed at this time, however, I do encourage you to get a good plan in place, and definitely get counseling.  EOS 0 0 19 I think that's the best idea  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I had child abuse in my life too, I really think counseling saved our marriage, 3 times. But like, I said, he didn't want to go. However, the first time, I did leave and stay with a friend, and that convinced him I was serious.  EOS 0 0 21 that's a good thought, I wonder what he'd do if I stayed with a friend  EOS 0 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I wish I could fix this, but I can't.

That's a great way to do something for both you and Garbo!!  EOS 0 0 16 yes I talk with her and if there is a park I will let her run  EOS 0 1 17 [Information] Dog parks tend to have a lot of owners who also love dogs. They can love on Garbo and give you some connection too.  EOS 0 0 18 We lived in Florida and went to the beach everyday  EOS 0 0 19 yeah the parks are ok, but I let her run more openly  EOS 0 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like Garbo likes the outdoors.  EOS 0 0 21 Yes. She loves it.  EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Is the weather where you nice enough to take her out?  EOS 0 0 23 She does not mind snow either  EOS 0 0 24 It is chilly but ok  EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] Ok. My dog, Phineas, love the snow!  EOS 0 0 26 Garbo hates small animals also.

[contxt]	0 0 0 Just found out my position will be eliminated in January. Freaking out! 1  EOS 0 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow. So you're being laid off soon?  EOS 0 0 2 Yes. Apparently the company just can't continue to operate and pay all of us. So my position will be gone. They said they may be able to hire me back after all the Covid stuff, but couldn't guarantee it 2  EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I've been laid off many times. Never gets easier.  EOS 0 1 4 [Providing Suggestions] Will they give you severance? Do you qualify for unemployment? Any offer for retraining or job assistance?  EOS 0 0 5 It is hard emotionally - as well as financially. I tried calling the unemployment office to find out what help they may have but no one answered me. 3  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your not getting the unemployment office to respond seems to be a common problem. They weren't geared up for this. Fortunately, the online portal has been helpful for many.  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] What are your skills and strong points?  EOS 0 0 8 I will have to look at that. I've not been in the job market for 25 years. I thought they may be able to provide some assistance in just where do I begin. 4  EOS 0 0 9 I'm a teacher at a private school. 4  EOS 0 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You want to know where to start. Sounds like you are young.  EOS 0 0 11 Well not as young as I once was - in my 40s. 5  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Teachers are wonderful! Experienced teachers are even better. Age 40 is still young enough to be competitive in today's market. You will get lots of job interviews and offers before you know it.  EOS 0 0 13 I'm concerned because now is just not the normal time they hire new teachers on. Plus a lot of the school systems around me are all virtual right now, so I'm concerned about that 6  EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How are your online/virtual skills?  EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Use your time off to get confidence in online forums like Zoom and MS Teams.  EOS 0 0 16 We've used Zoom for some of our kids at my current school but it's usually one on one, not an entire classroom 7  EOS 0 1 17 [Information] There's many online job hunting sites that are free. Indeed, Zip Recruiter, Craig's List, Monster, newspaper classifieds.  EOS 0 0 18 Yes I need to investigate those. I got my current job right out of college and I've been there 25 years! I'm so nervous about teaching somewhere else. 8  EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] I feel your pain. Being laid off is a stab to the heart. Very disconcerting. Sounds as if you have been thrown out of your comfort zone.  EOS 0 0 20 Most definitely. Not to mention the children that depend on me, many of the children that I work with have special needs and changing their teachers can be traumatic. So I'm worried about them as well. 9  EOS 0 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I'm sixty and one thing I've noticed during past lay-offs is that people end up in a better position.  EOS 0 0 22 I hope that is the case this time around for me. Ugh, I've got to do a new resume too!! EEK! 10  EOS 0 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I admire your dedication to the children. They will always have a place in their heart for you. Fortunately, children are resilient so the trauma could be short-lived for them. 
[reference_response]	i admire your dedication to the children. they will always have a place in their heart for you. fortunately, children are resilient so the trauma could be shortlived for them.

[contxt]	0 0 0 I'm having a hard time being my sons teacher and there is a lot of pressure with that.  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today?  EOS 0 0 2 I've been better. How are you?  EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I'm better than I deserve. Does teaching your son give you a lot of anxiety?  EOS 0 0 4 Yes, I feel like I'm responsible for getting them to do their schoolwork, maintain my mother sons relationship, and make sure that they do well in their schoolwork.  EOS 0 0 5 It's a lot that is on my plate on top of the other things that I'm responsible for.  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Alot of parents are experiencing the same difficulty, even I am experiencing trouble with my child. It is a lot of alien stress to us when, in the past, we were only responsible for ensuring that homework is done.  EOS 0 0 7 I agree with you there. It would be nice if they could be in school, but I understand that they shouldn't be.  EOS 0 0 8 I'd like more help and understanding from my husband, but he seems to be incapable of that.  EOS 0 0 9 Unless I badger him for it.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It's kind of a tired saying, but one strategy that has helped me is the One day at a time strategy. I'm sure you've heard of it. Basically, it means just do for today, don't worry about yesterday, don't stress over tomorrow, just treat this day as it's own task.  EOS 0 0 11 I've definitely heard that before, but you are completely right. I need to stop worrying about yesterday and tomorrow and focus on today, but I'm just not very good at that.  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Then, within that, one task at a time. Segment things he wants to do then reward him with them upon successful completion of school-tasks.  EOS 0 0 13 Yea, I definitely need to get better at doing that. I end up letting them play video games and with toys in the middle of the day sometimes because I have work that I have to get done as well.  EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] For my example, my daughter very much likes to play video games. In order to earn video game time I need two successful assignments. They have to be small, reasonable tasks, but also an amount of time that allows you to take it one bite at a time.  EOS 0 1 15 [Question] I mean, think about it, how do you eat a cow?  EOS 0 0 16 That's very smart on your part. I really need to learn to actually follow through and do that.  EOS 0 0 17 That is true and a very strange reference.  EOS 0 1 18 [Others] Well, one piece at a time. I apologize for the strangeness of the reference.  EOS 0 0 19 No, I appreciate the different references.  EOS 0 0 20 I was just surprised by it.  EOS 0 0 21 One piece at a time makes more sense than allowing myself to be bogged down by everything at once when I can only accomplish one thing at a time.  EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] You can't do it all at once, and neither can he. It's not a perfect solution, but its a solution that has worked for me. 
[reference_response]	you can't do it all at once, and neither can he. it's not a perfect solution, but its a solution that has worked for me.

EOS 6 0 7 all of it and I seem so little compared to everyone else like im just walking and wearing a ton of shame around me  EOS 6 0 8 ya I feel so drowned out by everyone else I feel like I am clothed from head to toe in it  EOS 6 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] So you are feeling worried deep down about something right now? Would you like to tell me more about ti?  EOS 6 0 10 I dunno if its worried so much as feeling so little compared to it. worr  EOS 6 0 11 worried might not be the right emotion  EOS 6 0 12 you are really supportive btw 8o)))  EOS 6 1 13 [Question] Do you think that perhaps you feel numb to things that are going on even though you should be worried about them?  EOS 6 0 14 No i think i feel dumb but its not numb. one time i went to the dentist and he gave me a shot in my mouth that was numb this is kinda of a prickley feeling its not numbness.. something close but a stutter mayber  EOS 6 1 15 [Others] I see - that is interesting, I have never heard of anything like that before.

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hi, how are you?  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today?  EOS 0 0 2 I'm ok. To be honest, I'm a therapist and I'm getting burned out on the job.  EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I hear you .. it can be very difficult dealing with other peoples' problems all day. Would you consider retraining for something else?  EOS 0 0 4 Maybe. I'm not really young anymore. The thought of going through more school...well, I dunno about that.  EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] True. So you feel you're stuck in a rut - you're not happy but you don't feel unhappy enough to move on?  EOS 0 0 6 I just feel like I'm in limbo. Just there. People complain all day about their problem. I have a therapist, but I think my therapist is burnt out too.  EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] It's a vicious cycle isn't it!? What about looking for another profession that does not involve much retraining?  EOS 0 0 8 I'm too young to retire but I don't know how many more years I can slog on with this career. It used to be pretty good. Now, it just seems the same gray job every day.  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] Are you in a financial position where you could take some time off, go travelling perhaps, and renew yourself?  EOS 0 0 10 I've thought about that. I'd love to travel. I feel an obligation to my patients. I don't want to abandon them. I could pass them to other therapists, maybe temporarily. I don't know how they would feel about that.  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I would hope that they would understand that even therapists have to have a private life. And I am sure they'd prefer you at the peak of your game and not burned out.  EOS 0 0 12 True. They might wonder how committed I am to them and to the profession if I go away for a while. I've thought about lightening my work load too.  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Yes perhaps you could switch to part time? If you could afford it?  EOS 0 0 14 Money not really the issue. I just worry that I'll keep burning out, just more slowly. Other therapists go through this as well.  EOS 0 1 15 [Others] Somewhere at the top of the chain there must a very weary therapist with no-one to talk to. Though I suppose that is where these bots come in :D  EOS 0 0 16 Yeah. One day I'll be replaced by a computer. Then the computers will provide therapy to other computers, who'll need a vacation when they burn out.  EOS 0 0 17 seriously though, I guess I could try part-time for a while and see how it goes.  EOS 0 1 18 [Others] lol. It's an interesting mental picture. I am glad you still have a sense of humour though  EOS 0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] Yeah - try and take up a new hobby with the extra time, maybe?  EOS 0 0 20 Try to. Humor is a defense mechanism and coping mechanism. I have hobbies. They seem less fun because my job is less fun.  EOS 0 1 21 [Information] I am sorry to hear that. On another note, have you considered speakign to your GP? Perhaps medication might help.

Okay - let me input it again.  EOS 4 1 10 [Others] Thank you, I would like to be able to help you but do not know what the problem is right now  EOS 4 0 11 I have this friend who is now on the opposite coast. We were out of touch for 15 years, but recently reconnected. We've been texting. But now he's demanding an apology, and it's completely unreasonable...  EOS 4 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] Ah I see .. you feel as though you friend is dragging up things from the past which are no longer relevant to your friendship?  EOS 4 0 13 No, not at all. It's new stuff.  EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Oh I am sorry, I misunderstood. Can you tell me a little about the situation?  EOS 4 0 15 We've been texting about politics, among other things. And we completely agree on the subject - that's not the issue. But I put up with his sort of acerbic wit - I ignore little put-downs, because I know that's just him...  EOS 4 1 16 [Question] What is it that he wants you to apologise for?  EOS 4 0 17 But recently, he was talking as if he was having symptoms as a result of having had COVID previously. So I asked, Oh, you had a positive COVID test? I didn't say it like I was challenging him - I just hadn't heard this before.  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] ah I see. I have had problems and sometime negative interactions about Covid with some friends too. I think it's a very difficult time for everybody; we are all feeling the strain and might be more irritable than previously  EOS 4 1 19 [Question] Can you see any way in which you can work around it and be friends again?  EOS 4 0 20 Yes - he's always irritable! ha ha. So instead of answering, he launched into this thing about how COVID antibodies disappear, so the tests are pointless. I know there are some issues with the various tests. As it happens, I have a PhD in immunology, so I know a lot about this stuff...  EOS 4 0 21 Yes - I want to be friends! It's not me...  EOS 4 1 22 [Others] I think that the tests are very necessary! Also social distancing and mask wearing at this time.  EOS 4 0 23 He started saying things that are just factually not correct. I get that the immune system is super complicated, and most people don't know much about it. But when I'd try to explain some things to him, he acted like I couldn't possibly know anything he didn't, after reading one Forbes article, and he started making personal attacks.  EOS 4 1 24 [Others] I think that perhaps you do not need this toxic person in your life. After fifteen years without him do you really feel you need to stay r reconciled?  EOS 4 0 25 I don't need him, no... But he's funny, and I don't have too many people in my life right now. I just moved to a new state where I literally know no one.  EOS 4 1 26 [Others] In that case perhaps you can just agree to disagree on this topic? If you don't want to risk the friendship :). I hope I have been able to be of some help to you today and thank you for talking!  EOS 4 0 27 And I'm also hurt and annoyed that he thinks I have anything to apologize for, when I put up with his acid tongued comments, and just turn the other cheek. I agree we should just go on, but I'm not going to apologize, when I didn't do anything.  EOS 4 0 28 Anyway - yes. I agree with you. Thanks for the talk. Take care!  EOS 4 1 29 [Others] And you too!

That is great to hear. I am the support provider, do you have any questions or problems?  EOS 4 0 6 I've just been feeling a little down about the breakup, even though it was like 4 years ago  EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was almost four years ago, but you still feel depressed when you think about it?  EOS 4 0 8 Yes  EOS 4 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] That must be difficult for you, to still feel that way.  EOS 4 0 10 Initially, I was sad about being heart broken, but later I became more concerned about why I had a strange complex I never even knew I had  EOS 4 0 11 Which I never discovered until recently  EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Being upset and heartbroken is very understandable, but what do you mean by a strange complex?  EOS 4 0 13 When I first met my partner, she was at a low point in her life  EOS 4 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you really feel she was depressed or upset when you met her?  EOS 4 0 15 Yea  EOS 4 1 16 [Question] Did her being depressed have an effect on you?  EOS 4 0 17 Naturally, I wanted to help her, even though I felt somewhat uncomfortable at first  EOS 4 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] of course you were sympathetic towards her pain, that is totally understandable.  EOS 4 0 19 So I stuck with her and saw her become better  EOS 4 0 20 even made some friends along the way  EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds great, that you were able to help her out in that way.  EOS 4 0 22 However, I suddenly started to feel a little depressed for some reason  EOS 4 1 23 [Question] So as she became better, you started to feel worse?  EOS 4 0 24 I believe it's because I felt useless after that point  EOS 4 1 25 [Reflection of feelings] That's interesting, so you feel that you were together so long as you could help her, but then you lost interest in her?  EOS 4 0 26 I didn't lose interest, it was just that I had this strange complex where I needed to feel needed  EOS 4 1 27 [Question] or did she reject you once she felt better?  EOS 4 0 28 She said that she was busy with other stuff  EOS 4 1 29 [Question] Has that happened to you in other relationships?  EOS 4 0 30 Never been in another one  EOS 4 0 31 I've had crushes, but it never went past that for various reasons  EOS 4 1 32 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have not had any successful relationships since then? Do you think that is why you feel depressed?  EOS 4 0 33 I don't think so  EOS 4 0 34 The thing is, I'm still friends with her  EOS 4 1 35 [Reflection of feelings] So that is good, that even after the end of your romantic relationship you were still able to maintain a friendship.  EOS 4 0 36 It's rather awkward, tho. We don't even talk often  EOS 4 1 37 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about volunteering in a position where you could be helpful to others?  EOS 4 1 38 [Reflection of feelings] So you feel that you are still friends even though you don't speak to each other often?  EOS 4 0 39 I've done such thing during the summer  EOS 4 1 40 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So what you are saying is that you spoke to her this summer and that made you feel depressed about the breakup? 
[reference_response]	so what you are saying is that you spoke to her this summer and that made you feel depressed about the breakup?

[situation]	We group of friends had decided to go on a tour to somewhere for fun and enjoy. We have been talking on similar topics and then only had an idea to go on a tour. We planned for the dates and the city to go, but not the places of visit. There started the difference. Once we had gone to the city and discussed for places, everyone was having a different interests to visit. We were not able to fix a kind of place. Every kind was displeasing to the other and there was not a pure enjoyment. Everyone was to anger of the other.

[contxt]	3 1 6 [Question] That's certainly a difficult situation. Is there no resolution possible with the father of your grandson? I want to make sure that th e cause of the depression has properly been addressed by you or someone else.  EOS 3 0 7 I try talking to him, but due to my grandson having some disabilities his dad does not really want to be bothered. I just want my grandson to succeed and be the best he can be  EOS 3 1 8 [Question] I think it's great that you have such care and concern for your grandson. That shows how incredible you are and on behalf of your grandson, I think you are doing a tremendous job. I think you should continue to support him however you can, but it's also important to take care of yourself. Do you have time available for additional self care, or are there any new exercises you can try to try to take care of yourself?  EOS 3 0 9 Thank you for saying that it means alot having someone tell me I am doing a good job. I recently purchased a hot tub and have been thinking that maybe when he goes to bed I could go out and relax, but have not done that yet  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] That sounds like a great start. Self care is vitally important in this difficulty time with COVID and the pandemic. I recommend any little bit of time that you can contribute to yourself, this includes reading, relaxing, meditating, exercise, or just resting. Anything that can help you repair so you are better prepared to help your grandson.  EOS 3 0 11 I will try my best to get more time for myself and try to relax more often that I currently am.  EOS 3 0 12 I am also trying to accept that my medical issues are getting worse and I can not do all that I use to, and that truly frustrates me as well.  EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Do you think the anger you are feeling is directly a result of the situation? Do you feel the anger is manifested from somewhere else? I think it is important to get to the underlying source of the anger and take care of that first and foremost.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That's concerning, but very understandable. Are you able to financially seek additional help? Sometimes it's just what you need, as hard or embarrassing as that may seem. No one needs to know what you seek, but it is important not to disregard additional help, be it mental health, physical therapy, or just general prevention and detection from a PCP.  EOS 3 0 15 I feel that I am having trouble dealing with the fact that I am not able to do all the things I want to do. It is not an easy thing to lose your abilities when you feel so young but your body says otherwise.  EOS 3 0 16 I was in physical therapy but could not afford it any longer. So instead I purchased my own hot tub to be able to soak in and do some water exercises that may help me.  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] I think that's a normal way to feel and a frustrating part of growing older. I think focusing on positives and things you enjoy will help keep your mind away from thinking about "what used to be" or "what once was" - finding passions and joys in new things could help revitalize you. Can I help you find new hobbies or passions?  EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I think exercise bands are a great way to keep your limbs loose and nimble. They are affordable and available on Amazon. I have some and I think they're great. YouTube can help with exercises. 
[reference_response]	i think exercise bands are a great way to keep your limbs loose and nimble. they are affordable and available on amazon. i have some and i think they're great. youtube can help with exercises.
[hypothesis_response]	of course! anything you enjoy doing can help keep the mind off of things like that.

I just lost my job and school is out so I feel like I have lost purpose  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Thank you for telling me. I'm sorry to hear that. What did you do for your job?  EOS 3 0 6 I was a manager of a retail store that closed.  EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] I see. That's a very important role for any business. I bet there are numerous other retailers out there looking for a good manager to hire.  EOS 3 0 8 That is true, I am just not sure if that is what I want to do anymore  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see. Well then, if this helps. The store closing might have been a positive thing, so you could find your next passion.  EOS 3 0 10 That is a good point.  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I will also add, that being a Manager means you have some very important skills that would translate well to your next job, or anything you decide to do.  EOS 3 0 12 That's true. I know the experience will help me but I still miss it  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Also, let's say you decided to work for another company, something new, outside of retail. Because you were a manager, you could also be promoted more quickly because of your management experience.  EOS 3 0 14 That is also true. I guess I just need to decide what I want to do now. That is probably the most difficult part.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Yes, it sounds like a part of you still misses the retail environment. I see that too. My best advice, is take a few days to think about what you really want to do. Think about what you are skilled at. Then decide which route you want to go. I know there will be numerous options out there for you in retail management, but if you wanted to do something different, there will be opportunities there too. Because you have options, you will likely pick the choice that will be most fulfilling for you, in something you will be passionate about - so this will likely be very positive for you.  EOS 3 0 16 That is really nice to say. I guess I am also just scared to go for something and have it not be as fulfilling as I thought  EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that's possible. but you will have plenty of options either way.

[contxt]	6 0 3 I am badly in need of a haircut due to the pandemic...my short layered hair is now shoulder length shag lol...I hate the way I look right now and it gets me down.  EOS 6 1 4 [Information] Initially, I used to feel like that and never shared my camera but I know I can do all the time.  EOS 6 0 5 oh really? how long did it take you to get up the nerve....its been months and months of mic only for me lol...and the silly thing is the people i'm zooming with aren't particularly attractive so I shouldn't feel ashamed.  EOS 6 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] When I saw many people were sharing camera and they didnt care about anything - few sitting in room full of mess but they dint care.  EOS 6 0 7 in person i am much more confidant...would like to care less.  EOS 6 0 8 care less about being on cam i mean  EOS 6 0 9 some people look so comfortable and relaxed! I just get seized up with anxiety  EOS 6 1 10 [Information] correct - it is just our mind thing which stops us not to share but once you start sharing you will feel confident.  EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Once you dont care what people think you will be more confident.  EOS 6 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] You will also be used to it  EOS 6 0 13 maybe i should take the plunge...it seems so silly to me because logically i am not in these meetings to impress anyone  EOS 6 0 14 maybe i'll pick the least threatening meeting and start there...one that's a smaller group  EOS 6 1 15 [Information] You can also try different backgrounds in Zoom which will improve the way you will look.  EOS 6 0 16 oh really? I haven't experimented with that. maybe I can get a friend to practise that with me  EOS 6 0 17 that's a good idea  EOS 6 1 18 [Information] Correct - you can start with your colleagues and then slowly you will start sharing in other meetings.  EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] no problem - practice always helps. Start small and then go big.  EOS 6 0 20 its hard I'm getting older now (50's) and its hard seeing my appearance go downhill. But at least it's happening with my other friends too lol. Gravity is a bitch!  EOS 6 0 21 what age group are you in?  EOS 6 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am nearly 50 as well.

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hello I am here to discuss my anxiety over the current pandemic.  EOS 0 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey there! That's a good topic to talk about. With everything that's been going on, it's normal to feel some anxiety.  EOS 0 1 2 [Question] What do you think is one thing that is giving you a lot of anxiety?  EOS 0 0 3 Thank you very much for your understanding. Yeah it's tough especially with rising cases for the past two weeks or so in my city.  EOS 0 0 4 I live in Canada and my city is pretty good so far and really low on numbers but have been seeing new cases every day for the last two weeks or so  EOS 0 0 5 so that adds anxiety to me when I go out and I am more on guard and paranoid  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. Similar stuff is happening where I am, and I also get anxious hearing about it.  EOS 0 0 7 And we had a lock-down earlier this year and yet, with the exception of one province, every province remains operational at full speed despite lock-downs earlier, and now a lot of provinces are seeing record cases with the second wave.  EOS 0 0 8 yeah I hope you get through this okay also and stay safe and well.  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] What do you feel when you feel on guard and paranoid? Try to say some more about that if you can.  EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thanks, I hope the same for you.  EOS 0 0 11 I go out pretty much only when I have a purpose and personal admin/errands. I work about one or two days a week out of my home. So with the rising cases, I just feel anxious having to get out of the safety of my home. I was a lot more anxious earlier this year though. I am much more used to it at this time.  EOS 0 0 12 And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after March. My life has been on hold and I am just surprised that it's even november now, because it feels like I am still stuck in March.  EOS 0 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yeah, that makes sense. When this was all new, the uncertainty probably made for more anxiety. Now that we know some more about what is safe and what isn't, maybe less so. But it doesn't mean the anxiety is gone, of course. It's still around in our day-to-day lives. 
[reference_response]	yeah, that makes sense. when this was all new, the uncertainty probably made for more anxiety. now that we know some more about what is safe and what isn't, maybe less so. but it doesn't mean the anxiety is gone, of course. it's still around in our daytoday lives.
[hypothesis_response]	i understand. i had a friend who had to get home from a long run to get her job. she was also in a similar situation. she ended up leaving a month later and it was really difficult and hard to find the right balance of time. she had to take some time to process her life and get away from her job and her family.

EOS 0 1 5 [Question] What is going on with you today?  EOS 0 0 6 Well. I can of feel depressed because I haven't been able to return the happiness that my parents gave to me.  EOS 0 0 7 One of my dreams is to give them everything they gave me as a child but I can reach there  EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So from what I understand you are feeling upset because you feel like you haven't given back what your parents were able to provide you>  EOS 0 0 9 Right now is hard for me to keep a job and the economy its crazy  EOS 0 0 10 Exactly  EOS 0 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] From the few messages we have exchanged, I can tell you are extremely upset by this,  EOS 0 0 12 Yes i am. This is one of those days that I think about it and make me up set  EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I myself have had issues with feeling like I haven't been able to give back to my parents what they have given me, it is a really hard situation to be in,  EOS 0 0 14 It is because it makes you feel bad and you start being negative  EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those are completely normal feelings to have, but I know you can get through this!

[contxt]	0 0 4 Nice to meet you too  EOS 0 0 5 It suckssssss  EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Gosh you've been busy :). I am sorry to hear that though - I know how much it hurts when you split with someone, especially if it was not consensual.  EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It's a lousy time of year for it too, isn't it?  EOS 0 0 8 I feel like a piece of crap, and childish at that. I can't maintain any of my relationships. I think I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life.  EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a defeatist way to talk! Just because a couple of relationships fail does not mean that you will never be able to find happiness.  EOS 0 0 10 Well, if past experience has any powers of prediction. I get super clingy, and do this push and pull thingy, where I break up and call them names, and then become so embarrassed it's hard to even bring it up. my last boyfriend said he thought i had borderline disorder  EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I have been in that position too. I hate it when I realise that I am not being rational but I can't seem to stop myself sometimes and this has sometimes let to problems with my inter personal relationships  EOS 0 0 12 Yea, that definitely seems to be part of my problem. I really thought he was different, too. And when he broke up with me, I tried to get him to spend the night with me in a hotel, and I felt so pathetic because I was practically begging for sex  EOS 0 0 13 I think I am an addict.  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] I hear you on that one too! It's horrible to feel that you are losing your self respect but I suspect that we've all done it at some point. Have you considered getting some counselling?  EOS 0 0 15 Sigh.. yes. I have seen several. I also take meds from a psychiatrist.  EOS 0 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you saying that they are not really effective, is that true?  EOS 0 0 17 Well... one told me that I should be put down like a dog to my face.  EOS 0 0 18 so, yea  EOS 0 1 19 [Others] Okay .. I hope you reported him!!  EOS 0 0 20 I didn't. I was younger then. who knows. not gonna lie. maybe they're right. Sometimes I think I'm a psycho. My last therapist was always doing deep breathing exercises. It didn't help.  EOS 0 0 21 I also have a lot of anxiety. A LOT!  EOS 0 0 22 I even got an emotiona support dog  EOS 0 1 23 [Question] I understand that as well .. I am on medication for it. A dog is a wonderful thing to have! Do you feel that it has helped you?  EOS 0 0 24 Yea, he's my best friend. At least I have one boy who has to stick around. He's on a tight leash  EOS 0 1 25 [Others] Dogs are very very loyal. They never cheat on you or walk out on you!  EOS 0 0 26 So trueee :) I just wish I wasn't such a freak.  EOS 0 1 27 [Others] I think you are probably not anywhere near as bad as you think you are you know :). Anyway I wish you all the very best for the New Year and hope that things pick up for you soon!  EOS 0 0 28 Alright, bud. Thanks. You, too  EOS 0 1 29 [Others] take care!

It is just that my job is ending soon and I have not found another.  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Ah that must be very worrying, especially at this pandemic time. What field are you in?  EOS 0 0 6 I am in the medical field at the momnet, but the contract is going away.  EOS 0 0 7 moment"  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I see. Have you already started looking for new work? It might help you feel more secure.  EOS 0 0 9 I have, but the location that I am in is scarce with work. Which is quite surprising.  EOS 0 1 10 [Information] Would you contemplate moving? I hear that there are a lot of opportunities in your field on the East Coast.  EOS 0 0 11 I would for sure, but that also makes me a bit nervous as I would not know anyone there. Thinking about all the possibilities raises my anxieties about the situation at hand and I am not sure as to what I should do  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I understand - I find it very difficult to meet new people too. Maybe you could join some online groups in new area before actually moving there?  EOS 0 0 13 That actually does not sound like a bad idea at all.  EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I find it much easier to meet people online. And you could get familiarised with local amenities too.  EOS 0 0 15 Where would you reccommend finding a group?  EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Facebook is a good place to meet people I find. There are all sorts of different groups there.  EOS 0 0 17 Familiarization would not be too bad, Facebook would be a good start  EOS 0 1 18 [Question] Are you likely to be in financial difficulty after your job ends or do you have savings as a safety net?

My friend died few years ago. And it's so difficult for me  EOS 4 0 5 She was close to me  EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You mentioned that she died a while back. Has something stirred up the sadness recently?  EOS 4 0 7 because it's close to her death  EOS 4 1 8 [Question] Oh. The anniversary. You made it clear you were close to her. Tell me about her. What was she like? What did she mean to you?  EOS 4 0 9 She was my good friend. Always take caring of me and I the same way. We lived close to each other so we always hang out  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] She gave you a lot of meaning and filled your time fondly. I am taking it that after she passed you probably felt empty and lately it has been getting worse?  EOS 4 0 11 Yes, it's true. It had happened with me  EOS 4 0 12 she was like my sister  EOS 4 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that. My best friend died a few years ago and he was like my brother.

It's so hard for anyone  EOS 4 0 15 I know that time it's the only way to move on  EOS 4 0 16 however it's so difficult for me  EOS 4 1 17 [Question] I take it that the loss was sudden and it was a shock to your system.

EOS 3 0 4 i feel alone eventhough i am in my home  EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your home work balance, are you working from home?  EOS 3 0 6 yes. i am working remotely from home due to this pandemic.  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand that you would feel lonely. Isolation is not healthy for any of us. It seems to be forced on us. Have you any friends or family you could call on the phone?  EOS 3 0 8 yes.i have. but , its bad that you can't meet them in person or you haven't gone out for a while.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is true, it feels terrible to not go out. We don't listen to the government anymore because we don't know anyone who died, so we still meet with our friends. I would be lost without them, however we don't meet as much so I do make it a point to call them. What will happen if you leave your home?  EOS 3 0 10 honestly, i am afraid to leave my home. we can't be so sure about our safety. so i am to be happy with the things i have. but the feeling of being left alone and work pressure sucks me more.  EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Do you have a lot of friends how were healthy that died?  EOS 3 0 12 i have lot of colleagues and friends. to the best of my knowledge, i don't think that the people who are healthy will die.  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have found that being in isolation lowers my immunity, and if I want to be healthy, fresh air, loving friends, exercise, good healthy food is the way to do it, not isolation and loneliness. That affect me emotionally and I don't want to despair, that makes me feel terrible. It doesn't feel healthy, and we know no one that has died either. But if you are not going to go out, do you have goals to help you not feel lonely, any ideas? Any thoughts on how you can fix this so you don't feel so lonely?  EOS 3 0 14 you are absolutely right. i just try to divert my mind on entertainment and cooking . my work burden increased to a greater extent.  EOS 3 1 15 [Information] You might even want to call your friends and colleagues to see if any of them are meeting up. We are social creatures. We need to socialize.  EOS 3 0 16 i can't afford much time .  EOS 3 0 17 considering the present situation, its bad for all of us to get socialized.  EOS 3 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure you are busy, but realize, your emotional health is important too and we always need to make time to connect with people.  EOS 3 0 19 you are right. may be i should think of more relevant options.  EOS 3 1 20 [Information] I think it is a trade off for us -- do we risk a disease we have a 99.9996% chance of survival from according to the CDC or stay at home and despair? I see no evidence of a pandemic nor do my nurse friends. So we live our lives normally. But some are afraid, and fear takes its toll on people. I say use your eyes, look around, if there aren't people dying all around you and you aren't hearing of a lot of people dying in ten months of this, there probably aren't a lot of people dying. And life is short. Hug those you love, you may not have them tomorrow, plandemic or not.  EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] I know you are working hard, but do try to switch up your life so you get some exercise and take care of your health, and perhaps list some people to call who you haven't checked in with in a while to switch up your life, bring some pizzazz.

EOS 2 0 8 no but i just don't get a good vib  EOS 2 0 9 vibe  EOS 2 1 10 [Question] Have you talked to co workers or others about this?  EOS 2 0 11 my coworkers are almost always unavaible. and be cause we are all working remotely they just dont' answer ims  EOS 2 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] This is a worry that many others are having right now. Maybe there is an online group that deals in this type of worry.  EOS 2 0 13 that's a good idea! you mean within my company though?

EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It's normal to feel nervous whenever we have an important assessment coming.  EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I myself would always be really anxious whenever I had any finals back in college.  EOS 0 0 5 Yes I have a bunch of courses that I need to do for my work, it certainly keeps me busy.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] I would suggest that you study as much as you can. The more prepared you are for that test, the more manageable you will find it and the less stressed you will feel.  EOS 0 0 7 Yes I am pretty good about that but it just kills my free time because I am working full time.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I understand. However, you need to be able to find some time dedicated to your school activities. You are the one who needs to decide how to insert it in your schedule.  EOS 0 0 9 Yes honestly I am the main driver behind me doing all this schooling it is just going to be good for my career and I don't just want to stand still.  EOS 0 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I agree, once you have your career set up you won't have to worry about working and studying anymore. You will be doing what you like for a good living. Think about the future.  EOS 0 0 11 That is certainly the plan  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Just remember not to stress too much about it. It's just one test at the end of the day, you can do this!  EOS 0 0 13 Yes I am not super worried about it it is more the stress from not having free time, also insurance textbooks are not extremely exciting.  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] I know that I told you to try to fit school time into your schedule, but the same goes with leisure time for yourself. Find an activity that you enjoy and try to dedicate at least an hour a day to it, be it exercising, playing videogames, reading a book.  EOS 0 0 15 Yes that is good advice, I try to find time for myself but time seems to disappear sometimes  EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Happens to all of us. I myself sometimes get too invested in work and the days go by without me realizing it, but it should definetely be a priority. Try to maximize your efficiency so you can do your work while having more time for other activities.

She immediately cut me off once she gave birth, so I haven't met or seen my child. It's been 7 months. We were in the process of working on an agreement outside of court and since this I've had to work with the court to get this started but it's been hard with COVID and not being able to meet with someone in person.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Did you sign the birth certificate?  EOS 3 0 3 No. That's the other thing. She didn't let me know about the birth until 2 hours after the fact. The hospital would only let one person there with her and her sister was there. I don't know if she put someone else as the father or not.

I actually had to block them on all social media. They are extremely religous. Which there is nothing wrong with that. But he didn't have the best relationship with any of them. They couldn't accept him for who he was. His biological father didn't have anything to do with him. His mom was remarried and had two more kids and they didn't treat my boyfriend very good growing up. He ended up living with his grandparents. He finally had acceptance in my family. He actually talked to my mom more than I did lol.  EOS 4 1 18 [Others] Sounds like a very complicated set up. It is sad when family members become partially estranged from one another.  EOS 4 0 19 His family has been pretty horrible to me and my girls. And I know it's because they have guilt for the way things were with their relationship. They didn't even invite me and my girls to the burial of his ashes.  EOS 4 1 20 [Others] That is extremely offensive and I think you would have had the right to contest that.  EOS 4 0 21 It's very sad. Not what I wanted at all. But they were really horrible to me and my girls. I know he would not be happy that they have treated us so poorly.  EOS 4 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] I hope that you are able to come to terms with things in the near future. Please try and focus on your girls and not worry so much!  EOS 4 0 23 His sisters went and cleaned out and took everything he had from the shop the day after the funeral. Which really hurt. The stuff he had there meant alot to me.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hello there. I'm suffering with increased depression and I'm not quite clear why.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I'm sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately?  EOS 3 0 3 No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that's the same for everyone.  EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression?  EOS 3 0 5 I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I've always had a low mood but now I'm anxious that it will continue to get worse.  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again?  EOS 3 0 7 Since lockdown haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don't want this to get any worse. What if she isn't available?  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] It wouldn't hurt to try and reach out. If she isn't available, there are other services.  EOS 3 0 9 What like support groups etc? I'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It's weird and a little concerning to be honest.  EOS 3 1 10 [Information] Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app.  EOS 3 0 11 I hadn't thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays.  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it's worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn't available. Sometimes its good to have options.  EOS 3 0 13 I'll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues?

[contxt]	3 0 6 I'm not sure I can find another who I don't have to pay. My insurance has a $20 copay and if I had to pay that I wouldn't be able to buy groceries. This came through my religious organization and he was the only one available in my area. I guess I just have to find another way to cope  EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] If you have financial issues and you need the help from a therapist you deserve the treatment. One thing you can do is apply for Medicaid and EBT. The state you live in will give you money to pay for groceries and to get help from a therapist for free if you don't have a high enough income. It may be worth looking into because all you really need to do is fill out some forms and likely you will be approved. When I was younger and struggling, this had happened to me and I received both of these benefits and it totally turned my life around. I think it can do the same for you as well.  EOS 3 0 8 I'm on Medicare and supplemental insurance. I didn't know you can, possibly, see one for free. I'll look into that. That is helpful.  EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Sure thing. What are some of the coping strategies you've been practicing with your prior therapist?  EOS 3 0 10 I asked him to help me with some but all he would say is that I should stop vaping (I switched from smoking some years ago). I told him it feels like I'm walking a tightrope and he's suggesting I get rid of the safety net without giving me something else, some other way to cope. He said that's not what a therapist is supposed to do and that my resistance shows I don't really want to change.  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I can see how that comment he made would be frustrating. If you feel like vaping, you should continue to do; however, what happens if say you go somewhere and find yourself in a stressful position? What would be strategy you could use in order to recenter yourself? Strategies are important as they balance us when we experience stressors that through us off. Have you ever thought about meditation?  EOS 3 0 12 I asked him about meditation and if he could recommend something. He wouldn't. I have only been able to do it successfully once, at the meditation gardens when I visited my son in San Diego some years back. Since I can't always get to that kind of natural setting, I was hoping he could give me some resources. Do you know of any place I can find some?  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Oh yes. Me personally, I like to scour youtube and find an environment with a sound I enjoy such as the beach. When I listen to that sound, I try to put myself by closing my eyes while sitting on the floor and breathing deeply for some time. It may be worth a try for you. I hope it helps you. Good luck!  EOS 3 0 14 That sounds like a good idea. I'll give that a try  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] I wish you all the best! 
[reference_response]	i wish you all the best!
[hypothesis_response]	that sounds very helpful. i think you can do it.

EOS 4 0 3 we've been together for 5 years.  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] And how did she break your heart?  EOS 4 0 5 through email. so it hurts even harder  EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it sounds like she broke up with you over email rather than face to face or even a call. Not very considerate.  EOS 4 0 7 yeah couldn't even do it face to face  EOS 4 0 8 I'm so hurt  EOS 4 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] From talking with you I can tell this has been a real blow and need to find a way to move on.  EOS 4 0 10 yes it has broke my heart into a million pieces  EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I've had that happen before to me a few times. It's just the absolute worst feeling.  EOS 4 0 12 definitely is. what should I do to get my mind off this awful breakup  EOS 4 1 13 [Information] One of your first thoughts might be to get back out there, but really the best thing to do is to start doing things that you like, and that improve you personally.  EOS 4 0 14 ok perfect. that will keep my mind occupied  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Do you enjoy any hobbies, or going to the gym? If so, that might be a great place to start.  EOS 4 0 16 yes I do. I like playing basketball with friends  EOS 4 1 17 [Others] That's perfect, and a great way to get your mind off her while having fun at the same time.  EOS 4 0 18 yes it will. but damn it sucks . I will take your advice  EOS 4 0 19 two more to go  EOS 4 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Glad to hear it. Also, once you feel you're ready, there are plenty of ways to meet new girls. There's the obvious places like online dating or bars, but also some not so obvious like the farmers market or shopping  EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I hope it works out for you in the end.

[contxt]	4 0 1 I'm feeling pretty good right now.  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you'd like to talk to me about?  EOS 4 0 3 I have a friend who knew me since I was little. She is a little older than me. She still treat me like I'm still little. I tried to explain to her that I'm a grown woman and I grew out of lot of things when I was a kid.  EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Is she listening to you? I know how it feels to be patronised by people who are older.  EOS 4 0 5 She still didn't get it. I want our relationship to move further but with her like this. I feel sad. Is there anything I can do?  EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Well, if she is not listening to you when you try to talk to her you have to ask yourself whether the relationship is really worth it?  EOS 4 0 7 That's true. I didn't think about it. Should I approach her and talk about it before?  EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Yes, I think it's always worth fighting for a friendship but there does come a point when it stops being at all viable.  EOS 4 0 9 Yeah, that's definitely true. I know she is a good person. So I would give her a chance and we can talk about it before.  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Does she have younger siblings? I am the eldest of four and I sometimes, even at age forty five, find myself trying to tell them what to do  EOS 4 0 11 She have a younger brother that is 9 years younger. She used to be only child for a while before her brother was born.  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] It could be the cause of her behaviour.  EOS 4 0 13 Maybe that's why. She have different personality than me. She is more into logical thinking and she love people and has bubbly personality. While I'm emotional but are social butterfly and after a while, I would need a break from people.  EOS 4 1 14 [Question] How much would it hurt you to end the friendship? Do you think you could make other friends and survive it or is it worth fighting for?  EOS 4 0 15 To be honest, there are some times when she made me cry or mad when I get home. I think that over the time and the more older I get, the more I would knowledge my relationship with her.  EOS 4 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] I know that I don't know her but to be honest it does sound to me like your friendship is a bit toxic. 
[reference_response]	i know that i don't know her but to be honest it does sound to me like your friendship is a bit toxic.
[hypothesis_response]	i've had a friend like that before. she made a lot of upset and mad messages. i would not want to fight for her friendship again, but i would like to know that she doesn't mean any harm to me.

I have 2 more years to go  EOS 4 1 35 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But don't give up what you started  EOS 4 1 36 [Providing Suggestions] Take classes now.

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hi, I have been feeling a bit down lately. My levels of stress and concern have been higher since the pandemic began.  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Sorry you have been feeling down. What are some strategies you have tried to help you cope?  EOS 0 0 2 Well, I have tried to get my mind off of it by activities at home. Spending time with my family.  EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those sound like positive ways of handling stress. It is natural of course to feel stressed out by the pandemic so it can be useful to think of ways to help manage that stress.  EOS 0 0 4 Yes, but I still seem to struggle with feeling a bit more down than I'd like. Not sure what to do.  EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Have you tried meditation and/or deep breathing exercises? I know I find that helpful when I am worrying.  EOS 0 0 6 I have tried meditation before, but quite a bit back. Do you have any activities you could recommend, without risking my health? Maybe in my own home, so that I can social distance.  EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] One exercise I find helpful is lying on my back with a pillow under my head. I keep my legs bent and put a pillow under my knees for support. I then put one hand on my chest and one on my diaphram and slowly breathe through my nose feeling my stomach press against my hand. I then exhale slowly through my nose and repeat for about 10 minutes. It can be very calming.  EOS 0 0 8 Okay, I will give that a try. I don't feel I'm at a level that I need therapy or medication, so this might be a good way to calm my nerves when I am feeling apprehensive or stressed out.  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Good, I hope that helps. I would also trying to reach out to others who are experiencing the same. It is harder nowadays with covid but there are many online groups. You could even start your own group!  EOS 0 0 10 Yes, I do find that there are times when I am on a social media outlet that it does seem to make me feel better. I can feel humor. But, it can be a bit depressing too. Maybe I should block the ones that have mostly negative posts?  EOS 0 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you on that. Sometimes social media can also be negative. I think that blocking negative posts is a great idea. It is a way of taking control  EOS 0 0 12 I wished I had some more ideas on some fun, interesting or things to fill my time at home. I often feel I get in a bit of a rut with the same thing. Since we are home more now.  EOS 0 1 13 [Question] Are there any hobbies that you have been interested in but never had the time for? Or perhaps hobbies that you used to do but have not tried in awhile? 
[reference_response]	are there any hobbies that you have been interested in but never had the time for? or perhaps hobbies that you used to do but have not tried in awhile?
[hypothesis_response]	you can do it! i have found that i like to try to have fun at home and have fun alone at night, too. i find it helps to be able to stay busy.

[contxt]	1 0 15 That's what makes me so mad!  EOS 1 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you've known one another so long!  EOS 1 0 17 All those years of friendship down the drain.  EOS 1 0 18 Should I call him?  EOS 1 1 19 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better  EOS 1 0 20 But all of my friends are still friends with him!  EOS 1 0 21 And they took his side!  EOS 1 1 22 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex.  EOS 1 0 23 How did you get through it?  EOS 1 1 24 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours?  EOS 1 0 25 Not one!  EOS 1 1 26 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class .. that was a great way to meet new people  EOS 1 0 27 I'm not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people.  EOS 1 1 28 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you?  EOS 1 0 29 He's a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him.  EOS 1 1 30 [Providing Suggestions] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly  EOS 1 0 31 But maybe I deserved it.  EOS 1 1 32 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly  EOS 1 0 33 Yes, he did.  EOS 1 1 34 [Providing Suggestions] No you did not! Please don't think like that  EOS 1 0 35 I'm just so angry that I could break something.  EOS 1 0 36 And maybe I will do that!  EOS 1 1 37 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will.  EOS 1 1 38 [Information] There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this  EOS 1 0 39 But what if it doesn't pass?  EOS 1 0 40 And I cannot afford therapy.  EOS 1 1 41 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now  EOS 1 1 42 [Information] There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free  EOS 1 0 43 I don't know if I could do that. I don't like talking about my problems with strangers.  EOS 1 1 44 [Others] And yet here we are :P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found.  EOS 1 1 45 [Self-disclosure] I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was  EOS 1 0 46 Do you have any suggestions about how to open up to people I don't know?  EOS 1 1 47 [Others] I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No-one will be judging you  EOS 1 0 48 That's what I am afraid of. Being judged by people.  EOS 1 1 49 [Question] Do you think that this might partly because your ex has eroded your self esteem?  EOS 1 0 50 Probably. He called me a lot of names.  EOS 1 1 51 [Others] The important thing is to gradually rebuild your self esteem. Do you have any things that you excel at?  EOS 1 0 52 I'm good at bowling. And I like riding horses.  EOS 1 1 53 [Others] Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends?  EOS 1 0 54 Maybe I will do that. Horses are so cool.  EOS 1 1 55 [Reflection of feelings] I can feel that you are starting to make progress already and are thinking of things that you can do post break up  EOS 1 0 56 I sure am. Thanks for your help.  EOS 1 1 57 [Others] You are most welcome. Is there anything else you would like to talk to me about?

[contxt]	0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut.  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time?  EOS 0 0 8 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes.  EOS 0 0 9 I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it's not the same as face to face.  EOS 0 0 11 Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then. Its not like it use to be.  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don't feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That's still a win.  EOS 0 0 13 We used to be able to go out and have a few beers together.  EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's good. Keep that connection. It's not going to be the same due to the circumstances. But at least you are seeking to keep that connection, and that is a good thing.  EOS 0 0 15 I hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm.  EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it's not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest.  EOS 0 0 17 Good idea..  EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But I am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work.  EOS 0 0 19 I like to do home repairs. Maybe I can find a group for that.  EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway.  EOS 0 0 21 Do you use any other social media for connecting with new people.  EOS 0 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I use Facebook, Instagram, and sometimes TikTok  EOS 0 1 23 [Self-disclosure] You should do mini videos on easy things to DIY on TikTok.  EOS 0 0 24 True. I have to change out a few old style electrical plugs. Maybe I can do something on that?  EOS 0 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] right! That is a great idea!  EOS 0 0 26 I saw a few TikTok videos but never post a video. Is it hard to post on there?  EOS 0 1 27 [Self-disclosure] not really. what i do is record the video beforehand, and then upload it.  EOS 0 0 28 Oh. Okay.  EOS 0 1 29 [Providing Suggestions] But you can also record it straight to the app.  EOS 0 1 30 [Providing Suggestions] You can also do the same on SnapChat  EOS 0 0 31 I noticed all the videos are so short. I think I will have to use YouTube for a longer video?  EOS 0 0 32 I never used SnapChat. Is that the one disappears after some time.?  EOS 0 1 33 [Providing Suggestions] Yes, if you are doing longer videos, I recommend YouTube. What you can do, is do a short clip on TikToc and then in that clip instruct viewers to follow your YouTube Channel  EOS 0 1 34 [Others] Yes Snap Chat dissappears after it's viewed  EOS 0 0 35 Wow. Thanks for all the great information.  EOS 0 1 36 [Others] Sure, my pleasure! 
[reference_response]	sure, my pleasure!
[hypothesis_response]	yes, i think you are going to have to do it from home.

EOS 4 0 20 really though.. was a stressful time  EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, they probably deserve an equal percentage of that anger...

[contxt]	4 0 1 Hi. Yes, I'm having a hard time because last year my dad died a few days after Christmas.  EOS 4 1 2 [Others] Oh I am so sorry! Dealing with bereavement is hard at any time but at this time of year I think that it is even worse.  EOS 4 0 3 When people ask about Christmas plans, I don't want to depress everyone. But I can't pretend everything's okay.  EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] So you feel as though you have to avoid people because you do not want to make them feel bad that you are feeling bad?  EOS 4 0 5 I don't know... I know my friends would be supportive. But then I feel like it's selfish of me to bring people down, when this whole year has been a downer for so many of us.  EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Well let me ask you - if the situation were reversed, would you feel that a close friend was bringing you down if they talked about their bereavement?  EOS 4 0 7 Maybe, but I wouldn't mind that.  EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Well, perhaps your friends would not mind you confiding in them either? That is what good friends are for, ultimately.  EOS 4 0 9 Another thing is that my mom had died in January, the same year. So everyone has already dealt with me grieving all year. I don't want to just be associated with sadness for everyone.  EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I am really sorry about that - that is a seriously rough thing to have had to deal with. Do you have siblings and if so could you perhaps talk with them?  EOS 4 0 11 I have a brother, but his wife is really terrible, and they are very close. He and I text some, and I try to keep that up. He doesn't need me the way I need him...  EOS 4 1 12 [Information] What about some sort of professional therapy? There are some organisations out there that will provide a certain number of sessions for free  EOS 4 0 13 Hmm, I didn't know that. I'm on a waiting list for a therapist through my medical insurance. I live in sort of rural Oregon, but maybe I could get help by text or video...  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That is a good idea, especially at this time when it's probably not a good idea to see too many new people in person. Could you call your doctor and ask them? 
[reference_response]	that is a good idea, especially at this time when it's probably not a good idea to see too many new people in person. could you call your doctor and ask them?

EOS 3 1 4 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you?  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Did he tell you that he is?  EOS 3 0 6 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with.  EOS 3 0 7 He will not admit it himself.  EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating.  EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, your partner denies the charge of cheating?  EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Are you and your partner married?  EOS 3 0 11 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying.  EOS 3 0 12 We are not married but we live together.  EOS 3 1 13 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man?  EOS 3 0 14 2 years  EOS 3 1 15 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating.  EOS 3 0 16 What do you mean exactly?  EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it.  EOS 3 0 18 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily.

EOS 3 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner.  EOS 3 0 22 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?  EOS 3 1 23 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why.  EOS 3 0 24 That is a good point.  EOS 3 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens.  EOS 3 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that.  EOS 3 0 27 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage.  EOS 3 0 28 But I appreciate your suggestions  EOS 3 0 29 and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile  EOS 3 1 30 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand.  EOS 3 0 31 I should trust my partner more than any random person.  EOS 3 1 32 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.  EOS 3 1 33 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, trust matters.

[contxt]	4 0 1 Hello. What are some of the quickest ways to kill myself?  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Have you talked to someone about this?  EOS 4 0 3 No, why bother? Everyone is just cruel. People are selfish.  EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand people can be cruel and selfish, but not everyone is. Some people want to help! Life is definitely worth living for.  EOS 4 0 5 Not at all. Why would I want to live in a degenerate world where millions die everyday? Be it hunger, disease, murder... Human beings are disgusting. We should go extinct.  EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Talking to someone you are close to, like a family member who cares about you, can definitely help.  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Can you try talking to someone?  EOS 4 0 8 Family? My family kicked me out of their own house 3 years ago. I am nothing but a burden for them. They would just appreciate if I died.  EOS 4 1 9 [Question] What about close friends, or people you care about? I am sure they would not want to lose you.  EOS 4 0 10 I have NO ONE that cares about me. Not a single being.  EOS 4 0 11 Are overdoses painful?  EOS 4 1 12 [Information] I care  EOS 4 0 13 I doubt you do. You are just getting paid to be here.  EOS 4 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, I can feel how sad you are about life and maybe a little overwhelmed with what the next step of life is.  EOS 4 0 15 What would be that next step if I asked you?  EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I used to be really sad about life too. However, helping others who are sad helped me become happier, knowing that I am helping others also become happier.  EOS 4 0 17 What makes you think someone as useless as me could provide any help?  EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Take a deep breathe and think about any happy memories. If you are sad right now, the only way is up from here!  EOS 4 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I believe no one is useless. We were all brought on this earth for a reason.  EOS 4 0 20 That's a very optimistic view...  EOS 4 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] Like I said, I used to be sad too and not optimistic. But now I am optimistic because I know what it is like to be sad, and I don't want others to feel how I have felt in the past.  EOS 4 0 22 I guess that's a way to view it...  EOS 4 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried to express your feelings in one way or another? If you don't want to talk to others, there is always other ways - such as writing, music, etc. Have you tried any different ways? 
[reference_response]	have you tried to express your feelings in one way or another? if you don't want to talk to others, there is always other ways - such as writing, music, etc. have you tried any different ways?
[hypothesis_response]	i completely understand. it's important to be optimistic. i know it'll be okay, it'snot going to happen anytime soon.

[contxt]	3 0 0 Good afternoon.  EOS 3 1 1 [Question] How are you feeling today?  EOS 3 0 2 I am feeling okay how are you?  EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am glad to hear that I am fine as well. How can I help you?  EOS 3 0 4 Thank you. That is good. I feel I am depressed because I have been bullied and it is still continuing today.  EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that. How can I help you deal with the bullies? Can you stand up to them in a safe way?  EOS 3 0 6 Well, to be honest, dealing with these bullies are pretty tough, Is there a safe way I can handle them?  EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] I understand your concern, but I feel you have to tell them that you do not deserve to be bullied and they need to stop now.  EOS 3 0 8 Okay. I will do that. Thank you.  EOS 3 0 9 Also, what if one of the bullies starts a fight with me?  EOS 3 1 10 [Information] Do you need any more advice on this matter or do you have any other concerns? The bully is the problem, not you. Do you have anyone who can stand up to them with you for support?  EOS 3 0 11 I do. One more piece of advice before we part ways. I have my fiance for support.  EOS 3 0 12 I would want to know how I can stand up to these bullies.  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Have your fiance approach them with you so you are safe. Be strong and firm and do this in a very public area if possible so you have witnesses.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have a meeting place where you feel safe?  EOS 3 0 15 Yes he has. I will thank you. Yes. We are meeting in a park and I have people who are coming down.  EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I hope this is all behind you soon so you can feel better.  EOS 3 0 17 I will thank you so much for your help.  EOS 3 1 18 [Question] When will this meeting take place?  EOS 3 0 19 Today at 5 pm.

[contxt]	0 0 1 Hi there. I'm seeking some support, maybe some advice in dealing with a situation at my work.  EOS 0 0 2 I've got a new supervisor who is so different from my last one.  EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sure, I see you need some support at work because your new supervisor is so different than your previous one  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What kinds of things are troubling to you?  EOS 0 0 5 Yes. They have a Military background and bark orders, and change the way I'm working without being open to conversation.  EOS 0 0 6 When I ask questions, they threaten my job. Telling me they "Don't have to explain themselves!" as they are my supervisor.  EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow, that sounds difficult with them being so militant. Have you been able to talk to any co-workers in a similar situation?  EOS 0 0 8 Yes, there are two other people supervised by him. One of them is also Military and new him before hand, they seem to get along great.  EOS 0 0 9 But my other co-worker is like me. Doesn't know what to do, or who to turn to.  EOS 0 0 10 Sometimes the work environment is pretty hostile when we're just trying to continue projects that were started before he arrived.  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds hard that it is so hostile at work when you trying so hard. 
[reference_response]	that sounds hard that it is so hostile at work when you trying so hard.
[hypothesis_response]	that's unfortunate. i can see why you might be angry at them. however, it sounds like it's not your supervisor's fault for the situation. the only thing that'd make me feel that would be a little better is that you're working with a supervisor who has a history of doing this to begin with.

[contxt]	0 0 1 Yes, I am feeling very anxious about my school work lately.  EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see, so your main worry is about academic pressure?  EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Is there a specific aspect that you are focusing on?  EOS 0 0 4 Yes, I am focusing on my grades and the pressure I feel from my mom.  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you been performing below your normal standard this year?  EOS 0 0 6 she wants me to get all A's. I feel she has too high of expectations sometimes, which makes me feel like I need to perfect my assignments and spend all this time on them.  EOS 0 0 7 No, I do well, it just causes me a great amount of stress.  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I hear you, I have been in a similar situation. Parents sometimes do not realise just how much pressure they are putting on their children to be perfect.  EOS 0 0 9 I feel like as long as I am meeting the requirements and am passing, she should be proud of my accomplishments.  EOS 0 0 10 She should be proud I am even going to college.  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Exactly! there is nothing at all wrong with not being a straight A student.  EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Have you tried to tell her how you feel about her behaviour and attitude towards your studies?  EOS 0 0 13 Exactly. I feel like there is this society stereotype of needing straight A's otherwise you are a failure or something.  EOS 0 0 14 A bit, but she uses the "I pay for your education" card.  EOS 0 0 15 Which makes sense, but still, I know I am doing well so it's just a lot at times.  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Absolutely not. There is nothing wrong with not being perfect. And she has no right to emotionally manipulate you by mentioning money.  EOS 0 0 17 I agree, but she does have money over my head, which sucks.  EOS 0 0 18 Don't get me wrong, I am very grateful for her financial support, but she uses it to manipulate me at times.  EOS 0 1 19 [Question] Are there any scholarships or hardship funds that you could potentially look into applying for?  EOS 0 0 20 Yes, I have received multiple scholarships, but nothing that will make a dent in the tuition.  EOS 0 0 21 College is too expensive.  EOS 0 1 22 [Self-disclosure] Ah, it is very expensive isn't it? I understand, I am still paying off my loans! But it should be worth it in the end. One day you could get a job working for Amazon!  EOS 0 0 23 That's what I keep telling myself, but I have this overarching fear that I will be in debt forever then.  EOS 0 1 24 [Self-disclosure] Debt is a very scary thing to experience, I know. I do worry a lot about it sometimes too so you are not alone.  EOS 0 0 25 That makes me feel better.  EOS 0 1 26 [Question] The main thing is, do you enjoy your studies and consider them worthwhile? 
[reference_response]	the main thing is, do you enjoy your studies and consider them worthwhile?
[hypothesis_response]	it'll be worth a try, i think. you can get by.

EOS 0 1 15 [Question] not really i've always worked from home. what about you ?  EOS 0 0 16 Not me so much. Business was slow for quite a while because nobody was really working. But it affected my husband, because everytime anyone in our house got sick he had to leave work becase his work didnt allow anybody to be there if anybody in there household was sick.  EOS 0 0 17 So he missed quite a bit of work  EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that must have been really terrible, i hope you all are coping with that  EOS 0 1 19 [Question] how did that make you feel?

EOS 3 0 42 My dad passed away 24 years ago and my mom passed away last easter too  EOS 3 0 43 what helped you?  EOS 3 1 44 [Providing Suggestions] I was taught to make very small goals. For example, I found it hard to go out for a walk, even though I knew it would help my depression. (Exercise has been shown to be as effective as antidpressants) So I was told, just walk around the block. If that's too much, walk to the corner. If that's too much, walk to the end f the driveway. If that's too much, step outside. If that's too much, put your shoes on. Baby steps.  EOS 3 1 45 [Providing Suggestions] And whatever small step you manage to acheive, celebrate it and reward yourself.  EOS 3 0 46 I would like to know because I don't like the feeling of depression and anxiety not being able to sleep  EOS 3 1 47 [Self-disclosure] Ultimately, my last depression it was getting my covid shot that helped most....lifted a bunch of fear and anxiety and restored my hope.

My parents are gone too, grief can be a long process. Grief is tough. That will get easier with time.  EOS 3 0 52 My meds I take have been increased and I hate to just take meds to try to help  EOS 3 1 53 [Information] The thing is though, depression is an illness.

EOS 3 0 59 I don't like to tell everyone about that because I feel like I am bringing everyone down saying that too  EOS 3 0 60 Yes the PTSD is from the military time  EOS 3 1 61 [Providing Suggestions] Are there any veterans groups in your area that help with that?

Is there any reason for it?  EOS 3 0 9 My best friend and I constantly argue  EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That's so hard. Was there any cause for the arguing or is it just general tension?  EOS 3 0 11 She hates who I'm dating and wants me to leave him  EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] THat's so hard. My best friend hated my ex boyfriend as well and we always fought about it. I tried really hard to understand where she was coming from. IN the end, she was right about somethings.  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] What was really helpful for me, was having us all spend time together so she could get to know him.  EOS 3 0 14 Ok I will give that a try. He's very good to me and I care deeply for him.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] You should try setting up a fun day for them where they can get to know each other. 
[reference_response]	you should try setting up a fun day for them where they can get to know each other.

[contxt]	5 0 1 I'm doing fine. My proble m is that my boss keeps hitting on a co-worker, who really doesn't like the guy. What can I do to make it stop?  EOS 5 1 2 [Providing Suggestions] Boy, that's a tough one. You've got to handle a problem like that pretty diplomatically. Have you talked to your co-worker, the one the boss hits on?  EOS 5 0 3 I've tried to bring it up with her indirectly, but it's an uncomfortable issue, you know? She is really upset, and I don't know whether it's my place to handle this kind of thing. It's more of an HR issue, but should I go to HR? Will that help, or just get me in trouble? I don't know.  EOS 5 1 4 [Providing Suggestions] That's a good question, and I don't know the answer. It depends on your HR department. Have you suggested that the co-worker talk to HR? Is there an anonymous system for filing complaints?  EOS 5 0 5 No, the company hasn't set up a system for passing along info that way. I don't know if she has talked to HR. She might not have because she's worried that it'll get back to her boss, and she'll get punished. I'd like to be supportive, even if I can't help solve the problem.  EOS 5 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's a good attitude. You want to be supportive and helpful. You sound like a good co-worker. Remember that the problem did not start with you, so you do not need to feel responsible for it.  EOS 5 0 7 Thanks for your words of encouragement? Maybe there is little I can do, but I don't want to let the problem fester. She's a great co-worker and a great worker. We need her on the team. What do you think a good first step would be?  EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] That's a good question. I would show support for her and empathize with her and her situation. Do you have lunch with her? Can you send her a text letting her know she's valued? She might appreciate that. 
[reference_response]	that's a good question. i would show support for her and empathize with her and her situation. do you have lunch with her? can you send her a text letting her know she's valued? she might appreciate that.
[hypothesis_response]	i think that you could start with talking to your boss about how she'd feel if she was being hit on by a coworker and see if they would let her get away with it. if they'd let her, then they're probably not going to want to do anything about it. and maybe just tell your boss that you feel that this is the wrong place to be in anyway, and that you're worried that you won't get fired for something like that.

[contxt]	4 0 1 I'm fine, but could be better just not too happy with my situation. Hope you are doing great  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am well. What's going on?  EOS 4 0 3 yes, have a friend who I'm very close to , but have noticed she doesn't tell me the truth this days. And not only that she has been distancing as in not calling , always waiting for me to call. I call her about a week ago, but wasn't happy how she dismissed my call within seconds telling me she will call me back only for her not to call till to day. I don 't feel like calling her again.  EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it seems like you have been noticing some distance between you and a friend and it also seems like he/she is not putting as much as effort into your relationship as you are. It seems at times that you put in all the work and that it's one-sided. Does that sound about right?  EOS 4 0 5 You are absolutely correct and this is someone I care so much about  EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] This must be very hard on you.  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] How does this make you feel?  EOS 4 0 8 Oh it is very depressing, have known her for a very long time about 16years now  EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Sixteen years is a long time. I recently when through a similar situation with a friend. In my case, sitting down and communicating how I feel about the situation really did resolve many things. It made me understand why all of a sudden she was being distant and in the long run, it made our bond even stronger  EOS 4 0 10 That's very good to hear. I would have loved to do ask her what the problem is, but knowing how she is hiding some things from me, I just don't feel comfortable approaching her. I had this feeling she is doing it on purpose, I just don't understand why.  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I think you should try to honestly talk to her about how you feel and express to her that you are concerned. If she blows you off or ignores you, maybe consider rethinking your friendship. I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant.  EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know this seems hard, but I believe that you can do it!  EOS 4 0 13 I will give it a try, but it's very hard for me to swallow the way she has treated me.  EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] People change sometimes and it is hard to understand. I want you to know that you are ENOUGH! You are smart and beautiful. Maybe it's time for this relationship to come to a close, but other people will come your way that will treat you like you deserve. I know it's painful now, but you will be stronger and better for going through this. 
[reference_response]	people change sometimes and it is hard to understand. i want you to know that you are enough! you are smart and beautiful. maybe it's time for this relationship to come to a close, but other people will come your way that will treat you like you deserve. i know it's painful now, but you will be stronger and better for going through this.
[hypothesis_response]	i understand. i have been in situations like that myself. but i think it is worth trying to reach out to someone who has been there before and could give you some support. i am sure that you will feel better in the end, and that you won't have to deal with the negativity of it.

[contxt]	4 0 1 Hello. I suppose I could be doing better.  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Anything in particular you're having a hard time with?  EOS 4 0 3 Yep. Thanks for asking. It feels to me like my GF and I may be breaking up.  EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry, I've been in that position before. Do you feel it's for the best?  EOS 4 0 5 No. I am very sad about it. She recently informed me shes going to go a graduate school far away after I made the decision to come to school near where she lives.  EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That's really hard, especially when there's chance it could have worked out if it wasn't for the distance. Do you regret choosing to go to the school near where she lives?  EOS 4 0 7 Yes. I feel like I put my life on hold for someone else only to have them throw me to the curve.  EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Definitely feeling like you're living for someone else and having them not do the same is hurtful. Although it seems like you're the one in the relationship who is willing to make more sacrifices  EOS 4 0 9 At this point, yes.  EOS 4 0 10 I just wish we would of talked about this a year ago when I uprooted my life the first time.  EOS 4 0 11 I fear that this will continue to happen.  EOS 4 1 12 [Others] Oh ok then it's not the first time this has happened.  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you might be right, if you notice a pattern then it might continue to happen  EOS 4 0 14 So you think this will continue to happen?  EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Most likely, she seems to need space to live for herself and is less willing to make sacrifices for you like you do for her  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] But even it won't happen again, you shouldn't have to live worrying that it will  EOS 4 1 17 [Question] Have you spoken to her about how you feel?  EOS 4 0 18 I dont even know how to start the conversation.  EOS 4 0 19 I feel betrayed and that I have wasted the last 3 years.  EOS 4 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Wow I can only imagine. But I think it wasn't a waste if there were good times and you had room to grow. In relationships you have to prioritize your own happiness and I'm sure if you mentioned that you're frustrated and hurt maybe you can understand how she feels and why she made the decisions she made  EOS 4 0 21 Its frustrating. I am sorry to complain. It seems silly with everything going on in the world.  EOS 4 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Absolutely not! Individual frustrations are the best things to focus on before everything that happens in the world. 
[reference_response]	absolutely not! individual frustrations are the best things to focus on before everything that happens in the world.

EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Dogs bring so much love and support. What a great idea. This can prove to be very helpful with feelings of loneliness.  EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Not at the moment. I have alot of animals running around my home that I feed everyday. I mean outside critters. I did just have a jack Russell.

[contxt]	3 0 0 hi  EOS 3 1 1 [Question] How are you doing today?  EOS 3 0 2 not quite ok! my head keep ringing, breathing rate fast all i could think of was the occurrence  EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What's the occurrence exactly that you are referring to?  EOS 3 0 4 caught my girlfriend cheating on me  EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh wow! I'm so sorry! I can't imagine how you are feeling! Have you found anything to do to keep you busy? Or maybe some good distractions?  EOS 3 0 6 no! all i think of is her, loved her wish she never did that  EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Do you think you guys could reconcile your relationship? Is there any hope? Is she willing to work with you and work through her mistakes?  EOS 3 0 8 i wished we could, i just cannot get it of my mind  EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] It takes time. Sometimes, the best relationships occur when people work through the most difficult occurrences in their relationship. Have you tried talking to her? I would recommend talking to her when your emotions have settled.  EOS 3 0 10 guessed you right, i just don't know if i can trust her, I don't think i can heal from the betrayer  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I would make a pros and cons list. If there are a lot of pros, I think it's worth a shot! Just give yourself time to process everything that has happened. You don't want to sit down and talk to her and let all your emotions come out. That could cause more harm. Just make a list and you'll have a better understanding of which direction you should go with your relationship!  EOS 3 0 12 i understand, its just hard to trust when the trust is broken, hard to know what direction to turn to, forgive her or move on, to choose is just a hard decision. Guess i need to hear her own part of the story  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Yes. Give it time. Wait to hear her story. Make your pros and cons list. And see where to go from there. Be easy on yourself. It's okay to have hard days. Just give yourself time to heal from the hurt!  EOS 3 0 14 I try working towards that, i just wish am back to myself soon because it has really affected me.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I am sure it has! Try to spend time with friends and family that can be there for you during this time. You need to lean on people when things get hard like this!  EOS 3 0 16 wished i have friends i could trust, all just mock and wished you worse, hated being alive  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] That's awful! You need better friends than that!! What about your family?

[contxt]	7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well.  EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you'd like?  EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material...  EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study!  EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted.  EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version.  EOS 7 0 6 Wow, that's actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me.  EOS 7 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Don't worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don't have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot.  EOS 7 0 8 That is true. I will reach out to her now.  EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure you will do just fine, you can do it!  EOS 7 0 10 I still have some self-doubt given that I have failed an exam in the past...  EOS 7 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam.  EOS 7 0 12 I really appreciate this advice. I am feeling better about the exam and feel like I should envision myself passing and doing well.  EOS 7 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, thats the spirit it works for me!  EOS 7 0 14 I will give it a try!  EOS 7 1 15 [Others] Okay is there anything else I can help you with or should I let you go?  EOS 7 0 16 No, I should go study now. thank you for your help.  EOS 7 1 17 [Others] Of course anytime, have a goodnight!  EOS 7 0 18 You too!  EOS 7 0 19 Wait! I have another concern.  EOS 7 1 20 [Question] Yes, what is that?  EOS 7 0 21 Do you have any tips for staying cool under pressure while I am taking my exam?  EOS 7 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I do actually. First make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best. Next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings. Take it easy and do not rush. Just one question at a time, next thing you know its over.  EOS 7 0 23 That is great advice. I will certainly try and get a good night of rest.  EOS 7 1 24 [Others] Great anything else?  EOS 7 0 25 Nope :)  EOS 7 1 26 [Others] Okay it has been nice chatting with you, feel free to end the chat now, goodbye.

[contxt]	0 0 2 I am ok. Just very sleepy.  EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Why are you sleepy? Long day?  EOS 0 0 4 I have been having trouble getting to sleep on time.  EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see, so you aren't getting enough sleep am I right?  EOS 0 0 6 Yes. I find it hard to fall asleep. This happens most nights  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] What typically happens when you try to go to sleep? Is it hard to quiet your mind?  EOS 0 0 8 I just feel anxious and sometimes I don't even know why. But yes my mind keeps going.  EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Not sleeping well is a problem I have on and off as well, and I have found those next days so tiring and frustrating. If you like I can share some of the things that have helped me?  EOS 0 0 10 Yes please. Maybe something you did could help me too. Did you also have trouble quieting your mind?  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I use this great free podcast called Tracks to Relax, it has guided meditations that really help me get to sleep. The seem to shut down my mind when I am thinking too much at bedtime. Which can happen to me some nights, anxieties can keep me awake.  EOS 0 1 12 [Information] The host's voice is super soothing and he spirits you away to the beach or the woods and before you know it you're out!  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] I also have strict bedtime/waketime that I follow, it's set up on my cellphone. No more sleepign in, because that just made it harder for me to get to sleep the next night.  EOS 0 0 14 That sounds like something I could try. Did you just google Tracks to Relax?  EOS 0 1 15 [Information] um I think there may be a website but I found it by opening up the Podcast app on my phone and doing a search.. There are premium options but I just use the free stuff  EOS 0 1 16 [Question] do you use spotify?  EOS 0 0 17 I have in the past. Is it on Spotify?  EOS 0 1 18 [Others] um i am not sure let me check real quickly, one moment  EOS 0 0 19 That is very nice of you  EOS 0 0 20 Thank you  EOS 0 1 21 [Others] yes it is! you are welcome  EOS 0 0 22 How long does it go for?  EOS 0 1 23 [Information] The reason I brought up spotify is that sometimes I listen to a playlist on there called "Gentle Lapping Waves" which is super relaxing...and I set my cellphone to turn it off after half an hour or so. As for Tracks to Relax I think most are about 40 minutes? To be honest I am not sure. I fall asleep midway through hehe  EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] do you have someone you can talk to about your anxieties like a counsellor?  EOS 0 0 25 I do not. But I will try with the podcast. It is easy and free. And if it gets worse I can look into getting professional help.  EOS 0 0 26 Thank you for listening to me and thank you for your recommendations.  EOS 0 1 27 [Others] OH another trick I use to get the thoughts "out of my head" is journaling. You are so welcome, it's been a pleasure talking with you. All the best in your quest for a good night's sleep :)  EOS 0 0 28 That is a good idea too! Thanks again and enjoy the rest of your day.

EOS 2 0 5 I was bit busy and wasn't able to talk to her for a few days, so she thought I was ignoring her.  EOS 2 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok i see so she thinks you are ignoring her?  EOS 2 0 7 Yes, she thinks I am ignoring her, but I never meant to do that. I tried to tell her that I was busy with some work, but she thought I was lying to her and now I'm very sad.  EOS 2 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you are feeling about that I would be upset to.  EOS 2 0 9 What should I do to still be friends with her? I don't know what to do anymore!  EOS 2 1 10 [Information] Have you tried to talk to her again recently?  EOS 2 0 11 Yes. I even texted her and called her. She opened my messages but didn't respond and she even ignored my calls.

I don't think I can wait longer. I might loose her.  EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe you should go up to her house  EOS 2 0 15 Due to the COVID cases right now I am trying to not risk the safety of others and myself.

EOS 0 1 4 [Providing Suggestions] Can the company hire any more people? Maybe they can work from home, and take some work off your plate. The line manager might also need some help with her workload.  EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] I understand that budgets can be tight. Maybe someone part-time?  EOS 0 0 6 From what I hear they aren't willing to hire anyone else, but I don't know the reasons why. I can only speak to my line manager and then she speaks to higher management.  EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your manager sounds unsympathetic. That's very frustrating. A lot of people are in your situation in this pandemic: too much work, not enough help.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Do you want to leave the company? Look for greener pastures?  EOS 0 0 9 I have been keeping an eye out for other jobs, but like you say things are difficult just now with the pandemic, there isn't a lot out there!  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Very true. Have you talked to your co-workers about this issue? What do they think?  EOS 0 0 11 They are all feeling stretched as well so they understand. I am trying to not talk about it too much with them, I don't want to be seen as the person who's always complaining!  EOS 0 1 12 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yeah, that's a good point. A little complaining is ok, but a lot can get on people's nerves.  EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] They want to be sympathetic, but after a while, they just get tired of you.  EOS 0 0 14 Yeah, I don't want them all to stop talking to me cause they find me annoying! I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard some days! As much as I try to start the day in a positive frame of mind it quickly gets sucked out of me!  EOS 0 1 15 [Others] What do you do outside of work? Hobbies and such.  EOS 0 0 16 At the moment I'm not getting outside as much as I should, I do enjoy gaming but it's hard to find time. I've been working 14 hour days all week! My boyfriend tries to tell me to switch off but it's hard when I know there's all this work waiting to be done.  EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] You could try setting aside an evening or two a week for time with your BF. Just walk out of the office. Try to set some boundaries.  EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] That might seem dangerous and risky, but sometimes it's important to set boundaries.  EOS 0 1 19 [Others] If you don't do that, then the managers can just keep taking advantage of you and your work ethic.  EOS 0 0 20 Yeah, he says the same kind of thing, that I need to be firmer and just leave when I'm due to. I guess the only way for them to truely see is for the work to just not get done as there's no time!  EOS 0 1 21 [Others] From what you're saying, it sounds like you think you have no power. Is that true? Are you really powerless in this situation? Do not underestimate your power over your life. 
[reference_response]	from what you're saying, it sounds like you think you have no power. is that true? are you really powerless in this situation? do not underestimate your power over your life.
[hypothesis_response]	yes, it'd be hard to have someone else work in the same space as you. i would suggest getting a friend to watch some video games or something else. i personally play video games myself, but if i'd want to work with others, i would play them.

EOS 0 0 2 I feel that my friends do not like me very much any more. Apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me.  EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities.  EOS 0 0 4 Do you think that I am over-reacting? I do not want to sound over sensitive but this has been happening for a while.  EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Have you talked with your friends on how you feel? When was the last time you all connected?  EOS 0 0 6 We went out for coffee the other day and I thought about saying something cos I know they went to a club without me last weekend but I couldn't bring myself to in the end.  EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you, especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee. I'm sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club.  EOS 0 0 8 Sometimes in the past I have turned down invitations to go out clubbing, admittedly. Could it be that they just did not think that I wanted to go?  EOS 0 1 9 [Information] From what I have experienced personally, I am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends. After turning them down a few times, they stopped inviting as well. I think they thought that was not my thing.  EOS 0 0 10 The thing is though that this is not the only thing - they have been to rock concerts without me too. I just feel I am no longer a part of the group.  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I feel how this is hurting you. The best thing would be to talk to them about feeling disinvited to group activities. Let them know you are still free and really want to spend some time together. Do you think you can open up to them on whats bothering you?  EOS 0 0 12 I don't know. I don't want to come across as just being paranoid or whiny. Sometimes I think it would be better to just forget them and not have any friends.  EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like this situation is really bothering you. Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated. The bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation. If they don't know what is bothering you, it will be harder to mend the relationship. 
[reference_response]	it sounds like this situation is really bothering you. its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated. the bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation. if they don't know what is bothering you, it will be harder to mend the relationship.

Because it will be painful to move forward, but if you have some goals, that can help you from falling into a slump.

EOS 4 1 20 [Self-disclosure] If a man did not want to be with me, I took it hard as rejection, but in the long run, if he does not want to be with me, I don't want to be with him, but that takes time, and you need friends to encourage you.

EOS 4 1 26 [Information] If a relationship has problems, you want someone to talk about he problems and work on them and grow as two people. He chose to walk away, that's immature and not what you want in a relationship. That is actually abusive.

I'm worried that he all of a sudden is so distant.  EOS 4 1 3 [Question] If it were entirely up to you how would you like your relationship to proceed from here?  EOS 4 0 4 I would ideally like him to say he was sorry and never look at another woman but now I doubt his faithfulness and think the only reason I'm with him is because I'm so lonely.  EOS 4 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you worry you will not be able to trust him in the future because of this no matter what his future actions are, do you think there is anything he could do or say that would change this?  EOS 4 0 6 I do worry a lot. If he would commit fully to me that would help perhaps. If he never cheated again but I don't know if he can do that reliably.  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] What would you define as full commitment from him?  EOS 4 0 8 I think marriage, but then again if he cheats then what commitment is that really if it ends in divorce?

EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there's a great youtube video on empathy  EOS 1 0 14 Thank you , I will. Right now I really need some sort of emotional support. I feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste.  EOS 1 1 15 [Information] i bring her up because what i sounds like is that you are feeling embarrassed because your partner made a choice that wasn't you  EOS 1 1 16 [Information] in reality the choice they made wasn't about you, it was about them  EOS 1 0 17 It is not so much that - it is that I feel that I dedicated the majority of my adult life to this relationship and now there is nothing left.  EOS 1 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are left and you are enough. even if you dont feel like it right now you are enough  EOS 1 0 19 I really do not feel like it right now. What was the last fifteen years all about? I wanted to have children with him and he refused but now I hear he is expecting a baby with another woman.  EOS 1 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] a relationship is part of who you are. it isn't you  EOS 1 0 21 But it is very difficult to try to strike out on my own again and I do not know if I even want to.

Right now it's hard to see any sort of way through these feelings.  EOS 1 1 26 [Information] yes, middle age is scary, but there are so many things you can do. ageism is out  EOS 1 0 27 I feel I might have missed out on my chance to have a family of my own though, because I waited fifteen years and my partner would not go for that.  EOS 1 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] please watch the cartoon animals and brene brown on youtube talk about empathy. find one of your friends who has been through the suck and let them help you find your path out.

EOS 1 1 30 [Self-disclosure] i had an emergency ovary removal in my early 30s and didn't know if i woudl be able to have children. my doctor told me that the most important thing i could do was to be healthy becuse a healthy mother was what i could give my children even if i adopted them  EOS 1 0 31 That sounds like very good advice from both you and your doctor. It is a difficult thing to have to confront though. I really do appreciate the fact that you have taken the time to talk honestly with me.

EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Is there anything that's bothering you?  EOS 3 0 5 Yes, I broke up with my partner...  EOS 3 1 6 [Others] Oh no I'm sorry to hear that.  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] do you want to talk about what happened?  EOS 3 0 8 I am very depressed... cannot go on with my daily life.  EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this is really affecting you, that must be hard  EOS 3 1 10 [Question] How long were you and your partner together?  EOS 3 0 11 Yes, it is hard.. we have been together for last 6 months..  EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I've been through break ups as well where things can seem pointless afterwards. It took me some time but I eventually got through it  EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Were you happy in the relationship?  EOS 3 0 14 How did you cope up with the situation?  EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I talked to my friends about it a lot, and tried to keep myself occupied with lots of activities  EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I also deleted old messages from my partner so I didn't dwell on the past as much  EOS 3 0 17 How does talking to friends help?  EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] It depends on the situation, but for me I had a lot of unresolved feelings from not getting proper closure, so ranting to my friends about how my partner hurt me helped satisfy that  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have friends you feel comfortable talking to about this?  EOS 3 0 20 I have couple of close friends I can talk to.. but have not thought about doing so..  EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] I think it could be helpful, friends can be really supportive  EOS 3 0 22 Yes, I will give it a try...

EOS 5 0 3 Sure, I guess "venting" is pretty much all I have that I can do at this point.  EOS 5 1 4 [Question] Do you feel like you can't take any actions in the situation?  EOS 5 0 5 Long story short - at work, a new boss pulled all the leadership OUT of the jobs they were hired for (some more than 12 years ago - so they have lots of experience) and shuffled them all around to new jobs - all that is except the 5 oldest employees - they got moved into "non-positions". No longer supervising anyone, only doing grunt work, etc. It ticks me off and there's nothing I can do about it.  EOS 5 0 6 I'm working on a *possible* action - RETIREMENT from this job. Only problem is - bad time to be doing that; pressure to keep my income up until my daughter graduates college, etc.  EOS 5 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds frustrating, especially if you're one of the employees affected and when the new boss doesn't seem to know what he/she is doing with the reorganization.

[hypothesis_response]	i understand. i was in the same situation when i was younger, and i felt like a total boss. i had to put in my time and effort to keep things going, and that was tough. but i found that it's not always easy to leave your job and move on.

EOS 0 0 3 The company I work for is winding down. i'm on the old side to be looking for a job and i'm likely going to have to accept a lower salary, a longer commute and a heavier workload. In other words, I have a job I love, close to where I live that is very manageable. I can't sleep and I'm insanely anxious all of the time.  EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can feel your anxiety, and I completely understand why you're feeling that way, but you don't know for sure that will be true. Have you started looking for a new job already?  EOS 0 0 5 I started looking for a job last week. I had a transition meeting today to pass on the little bit of my work that will be left to another person. I have 2 children; one who just started college this fall and another who is a junior in high school. my elderly mother lives with me also so I can't sell my house any time soon and move into something smaller and cheaper. I feel really trapped at the moment.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] It definitely sounds like you're being overwhelmed with a lot of responsibilities along with your job loss. It's definitely a lot of things to deal with all at once, but it would help to break things down so they're more manageable. Do you have anyone close by who can help you out?  EOS 0 0 7 i have friends and family close by. i don't like to burden people with my problems. I know i also don't adjust well to change and that doesn't help.  EOS 0 0 8 breaking issues down into groups is helpful and may take away some of the enormity of everything.  EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I understand completely. I used to bottle things up too, but I've learned that the people who love you won't think you're a burden if you ask for help or just to have someone blow off some steam.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Changes are definitely scary, but they can also be a great opportunity to do something different. Is there anything you want to try doing?  EOS 0 0 11 I've always been reluctant to ask for help or favors because i keep thinking there will always be a time down the road where i will need something more. it's helpful to have someone remind me that change isn't always a bad thing. thank you.  EOS 0 0 12 I'll talk to some friends to see if anyone has some good budget cutting tricks. I'll continue to look for a job and i'll try to calm down a little for now.  EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you're very self-aware and I think your friends and family will be very willing to lend a hand.  EOS 0 0 14 i am aware of many things including how truly fortunate i am to have my family, friends and health. I really appreciate your kind words and calming suggestions.  EOS 0 0 15 thank you again.  EOS 0 1 16 [Others] Yes, your family, friends, and health are all really important! I hope you stay safe!

EOS 2 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I was in a similar situation a short while back I can understand if you feel anxious and stressed.  EOS 2 1 5 [Question] Was it due to the pandemic?  EOS 2 0 6 Yes it is. We haven't gotten the funding form the government and we are a small business. I am not sure how to tell my wife.  EOS 2 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So if I understand the anxiety of you losing your job is increased because you also have to give your wife the news? 
[reference_response]	so if i understand the anxiety of you losing your job is increased because you also have to give your wife the news?
[hypothesis_response]	i would say that you should be able to tell her that you are worried that the panderic is causing you to feel anxious.
[comet query]	Yes it is. We haven't gotten the funding form the government and we are a small business. I am not sure how to tell my wife.

[contxt]	4 0 9 If you never experienced this do you know of anyone who has? What did they do to get out of this type of relationship if you want to call it that?  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I can sense your frustration, and his marriage just adds to that. I've known lots of people who've ended up in relationships with married people.  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Just reaching out to talk with someone else is a great first step.  EOS 4 0 12 What did those people do to end the relationship if you want to call it that?  EOS 4 0 13 You keep saying it's good to reach out. I'm reaching out to you trying to find a way to turn off my emotions for this man.  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes, a good first step is to reach out to friends who can help you fill your time and avoid interactions with him.  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] And co-workers often can help you find ways to avoid him in the office. Are others aware of the relationship who can help you with that?  EOS 4 0 16 My friends don't know about my situation with Doug. I do suspect some people at work are putting us eating lunch and taking walks together as something more. +  EOS 4 0 17 Doug make my sing and makes my body come alive but his presence is starting to break my heart because this situation is not going anywhere. I need help! It's not Doug's problem it's mine!  EOS 4 0 18 I don't like his wife because if she was treating him well he wouldn't be with me. So why doesn't she just let him go?  EOS 4 0 19 I'm starting to think if she was out the picture Doug and I could be together in a real relationship you know what I mean?  EOS 4 1 20 [Others] I can hear your anguish, and I understand your frustration. It's not clear to me, though, that Doug is being honest with you or with his wife.  EOS 4 1 21 [Question] You mentioned that Doug can't provide the emotional support that you need. Do you think he's being fully honest with you about his relationship with his wife?  EOS 4 0 22 I don't understand. Doug's married I know that but I want what his wife has so she's not the problem.  EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You're absolutely right. It sounds like Doug is the problem. He's cheating on his wife, and he's not giving you the emotional support you need.  EOS 4 0 24 All I want to know from you is to tell me how to get rid of the feelings I have for Doug or how to get rid of his wife since you think she's part of the problem?  EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] With the holidays coming up, maybe you could avoid him for an extended stretch and really do something about what it is you are looking for in a partner.  EOS 4 0 26 Like what? The media says stay inside with love ones. Doug is my love one. Wouldn't I be putting myself at risk of getting the conrovirus meeting someone new?  EOS 4 1 27 [Others] I wouldn't say that Doug's wife is part of the problem. She's sounds like another victim of his philandering and dishonesty.  EOS 4 0 28 Why do you keep focusing on the wife? You make it sound if I just kill her Doug and I could be happy and I wouldn't have to worry about his Philandering as you call it anymore. Are you saying I'm a Philanderer?  EOS 4 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You're right. It's best to err on the side of caution when it comes to covid. But remember that Doug isn't your loved one alone. He's sharing germs with both you and his wife. Maybe a lockdown -- emotional and physical -- will help you work to find an end to this relationship. 
[reference_response]	you're right. it's best to err on the side of caution when it comes to covid. but remember that doug isn't your loved one alone. he's sharing germs with both you and his wife. maybe a lockdown - emotional and physical - will help you work to find an end to this relationship.

EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Was it too serious?

EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If so i'm sure your manager will tell you to make sure in case for next time  EOS 2 0 8 Yes is it. But before me nobody made a mistake such as this one in my team.  EOS 2 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Mistakes happen, they are unavoidable, and your manager should know this so since it is your first time he should take it easy  EOS 2 1 10 [Others] Just make sure it doesn't happen again because you need to learn from this mistake :)  EOS 2 0 11 I fear I will have a serious conversation tomorrow with my manager and I will be told off.

I am sorry to hear that. Why are you so sad?  EOS 4 0 3 I met the love of my life last year and after a few months, i just knew he was for me. We decided to get engaged after 7 months which didn't seem so crazy to us at 29. We decided to get married after 8 more motnhs.  EOS 4 0 4 My friends are mostly single and don't understand.  EOS 4 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are sad because they don't understand you and they are jealous of you maybe?

I was depressed because I lost my job.  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I've struggled with alcohol before too and understand how tough it is to not drink especially during a tough time like after losing a job. Don't beat yourself up, it's only natural and you have the power to get through this trying time.  EOS 3 0 5 I feel calm to know someone else knows what am feeling.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] How long ago did you lose your job?  EOS 3 0 7 How can I stop going back to alcohol when am depressed?  EOS 3 0 8 Its been a few weeks since I lost my job but I never told anyone In my family.  EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] My advice is to try to talk to your family and explain to them that you lost your job and are feeling down. While they may not accept it at first it is a good start to try to give them some context for why you are drinking.  EOS 3 1 10 [Information] Alcohol is a way of self medicating; some people find it helpful to talk to a doctor to get an actual prescription for a medication to help. I personally stopped drinking once my doctor found the correct medication for me. That allowed me to be happy without drinking.

[contxt]	4 0 1 Hi, how goes?  EOS 4 1 2 [Others] I'm doing fine, you can tell me your problems  EOS 4 0 3 Well, you see when I was dating my ex she and I had a threeway with the woman who was living in my mother-in-law apartment at the time. Well the ex and I broke up not too long after, and eventually the mother-in-law woman and I got married. My ex lives next door though, and her and my wife bump into each other all the time and sparks tend to fly. It's kind of awkward in the neighborhood.  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oooh that's a very complicated situation. They are both adults, I hope even with tension, they don't do anything inappropriate, do they?  EOS 4 0 5 Well, the ex has gotten in the wife's face once or twice, but that's simmered down some. Part of the problem also is that the ex is simultaneously one of the smartest people I've ever met, and also a pretty serious alcoholic. So she's brilliant, but kind of emotionally stunted at the same time.  EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, those people are the hardest to deal with. If it's too much, have you and your wife considered moving away?  EOS 4 0 7 Oh I can't imagine ever moving. We have a pretty terrific house. Plus I bought most of the neighboring houses over the years, so now it's kind of a whole compound. I don't know that there's any particular fix for this, it's just sort of something to live with I think.  EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I understand, you're in a very tough spot. Have your wife ever expressed her annoyance?  EOS 4 0 9 Oh a little bit. She's only mildly weirded out by the whole thing. It's a shame the ex has to be kind of problematic about everything. I mean otherwise we could all still hang out and whatnot  EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's not too bad then. Your wife seems to be mature and understanding. If you can't do anything to completely avoid your ex, maybe your best choice is to limit seeing her as much as possible  EOS 4 0 11 That's pretty good advice I'd say!  EOS 4 1 12 [Others] You and your wife can hang out a bit further from your home. It's inconvenient but at least your time won't be interrupted by your ex  EOS 4 0 13 Yes, that's a possibility as well I suppose.  EOS 4 0 14 I think we're allowed to wrap this up at this point, if you like?  EOS 4 0 15 Still with me?  EOS 4 0 16 yooo hooo  EOS 4 1 17 [Others] I'm here 
[reference_response]	i'm here

I leave out so much important information!  EOS 0 0 12 that is a good idea. i updated the contact info. but i could read it again.  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] That might be good. Try to include all those little details about what you did, even if it doesn't seem significant. I think it shows flexibility and willingness to like cross train and learn new skills  EOS 0 0 14 i feel like no one is really hiring because of the holidays i can understand that, except i need employment now. i already cut back on christmas and am just making little inexpensive gifts  EOS 0 0 15 can i ask you something?  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's definitely a good way to save money, and I think the homemade gifts are more meaningful and full of love, anyway. And yes, of course!  EOS 0 0 17 i hope that the love comes across!  EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, I'm sure it will! Just knowing that you took the time and made the effort to make something personal for them is amazing!  EOS 0 0 19 do you think anyone actually reads the cover letter part of your application?  EOS 0 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I honestly don't know. Cover letters are weird, I never know how to do them correctly lol I don't know if they're there just to make sure you're following directions or if they're actually important. I like to think someone does, but I'm really not sure.  EOS 0 0 21 Right!?! I agree! Lol.  EOS 0 1 22 [Others] Applications are so weird! Why do I want to work here? Um, because these bills won't pay themselves lol

[contxt]	3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand that might make you feel uncomfortable.  EOS 3 0 6 I feel like I go out of my way to help people and I remember their birthdays and I try and be nice to them but no one ever does the same for me  EOS 3 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I have been in many work situations and even social situations where I did not feel as if I fit in, I'm rather an unusual person. I had to learn to not focus so much on BEING accepted. I had to learn what God think of me (he loves me) and try to be kind to all I meet, other centered. That is, I also had to make sure I wasn't being rude or mean.  EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand how hurtful that is. Our society isn't as kind as it once was. I find very few people appreciate kindness. However, I can't get caught up in that, it's the way people are. It isn't a reflection of myself.  EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I think it is the hardest thing to be more concerned with others than we are with ourselves, it can be lonely.  EOS 3 0 10 I think from now on I’m just going to focus on myself and my family, I’m not gonna out of my way to be nice to my coworkers, I’m just going to treat them as coworkers not as friends and just keep to myself  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I think you can be kind to them, but I think perhaps your expectations are that they reciprocate, and they aren't which hurts. Perhaps be kind without expecting anything in return, and know that God sees your kindness.  EOS 3 0 12 I always feel like you have to be a friend to have friends, but I’m tired of being the only one putting effort in and getting taken advantage of  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also had this happen, I had no friends and at first I thought it was me, then I realized it was an opportunity for personal growth. Which wasn't easy.  EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] How do you feel they take advantage?  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] Being ignored is one thing, having someone take advantage of you is a different story.  EOS 3 0 16 I just feel like they just expect me to do things for them now and when I do it, it’s no appreciated because they just know I will do it.  EOS 3 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] I understand. Yes, then they definitely are taking advantage. Have you read anything on setting boundaries and learning how to say no?  EOS 3 0 18 Yeah, I’m working on taking care of myself more than worrying about everyone else. I think the holidays make it even harder to set the boundaries  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I had learned once that it is so important to be able to easily say no because then we are free to say yes. Because if we say yes because we CAN'T say no, then we feel resentful. So If I can freely say no to you, then i am free to say yes, if that makes sense. Although for me, it was hard to say no, but it gets easier, now it is easy. It wasn't at first.  EOS 3 0 20 Thank you! You have been very helpful. I think that will be my goal! Start learning to say no and don’t feel guilty about it. I think I am going to lower my expectations from other people and just start treating people as they treat me!  EOS 3 1 21 [Information] If I always say yes, because I can't say no, I feel obligated and resentful, when really, it's me with the problem, I had a hard time saying no because I didn't want to hurt people. Now, I do the right thing in my heart, if I want to help, I help, if I want to say no, I say no even if it is hard, I don't care if they get upset. I can say no, that's true freedom.  EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] I don't advise treating people the way they treat you though. I would remain a kind person. Be the person you are no matter what type of person they are. You have to stand before God one day. If they are ugly, that's on them. But you want to be a kind person. That's the right thing, and you CAN be kind and say no. Those two are fine together! :D  EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] I suggest a book called "Bounderies" one of the authors is Townsend -- great book. 
[reference_response]	i suggest a book called bounderies" one of the authors is townsend - great book.

Would you like to talk a bit more about your situation?  EOS 0 0 4 I agree, the pandemic has made things really tough  EOS 0 0 5 I would be happy to talk more about my situation  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Are you in employment at the moment, even part time?

I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast  EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while  EOS 2 0 6 tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright :)  EOS 2 0 8 I have one and it helps sometimes. I try to meditate  EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently 
[reference_response]	yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. does it help you? if it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently

[contxt]	3 0 0 Hi, I'm very depressed and sad.  EOS 3 0 1 Please help  EOS 3 0 2 Please help me I need help  EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know why you feel depressed and sad?  EOS 3 0 4 I think it's because of my poor relationships in life  EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried taking some deep breaths to help you right now?  EOS 3 0 6 I'll try and see if that calms me down.  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Tell me more about the poor relationships you have  EOS 3 0 8 My family doesn't like me because I'm bad at school. My friends don't really like me or talk to me much. I feel alone.  EOS 3 1 9 [Information] Are you able to talk to anyone about this? Someone who will at least listen to you talk?  EOS 3 0 10 Not really. I try to talk to my friends but they avoid me.  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe you could take one person aside by themselves and talk privately about your feeling?  EOS 3 0 12 That seems like a good idea.  EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, just wait for the right time when the person is alone and ask if you could talk.  EOS 3 0 14 I'll try to do that, thank you.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Remember to take deep breaths, wait for the right time and see if that works for you. I know you can do it.  EOS 3 0 16 Thank you so much. I feel like I can talk to someone now.  EOS 3 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I have faith in you. Is there anything else we need to talk about?  EOS 3 0 18 No, I'm okay. I feel a little better. I hope I'll be able to talk to a friend soon  EOS 3 0 19 Sad!  EOS 3 0 20 Actually I need more help  EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Remember, the outcome may not be perfect but slowly things will come together. Take it one step at a time.  EOS 3 0 22 What step should I take after this one?  EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] See if the conversation gives you some insight on how things could be better. Maybe you could see things from someone else's perspective.  EOS 3 0 24 Thank you so much!! You're helping me a ton  EOS 3 1 25 [Question] Would you be willing to give it a try?

EOS 4 0 3 yes it is a horrible time.

I have found them very useful personally.  EOS 4 0 7 i have neve rheard of them but i will google them up  EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] They provided me with loads of helpful advice and other people to get in touch with. Also, have you considered using a food bank?  EOS 4 0 9 i did look up food bank, but there is none located where i live but i might be able to drive to the nearest one outside the city  EOS 4 1 10 [Information] There are religious organisations that can sometimes help too and would not expect you to be of their religion.

I think that would make most people feel upset.  EOS 3 0 9 i'm not really sure what i'm doing wrong  EOS 3 1 10 [Information] Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though.  EOS 3 0 11 what can i do though?  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there's anything going on?  EOS 3 0 13 hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though  EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it's happening and not have the opportunity to ask.  EOS 3 0 15 yes...hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though.  EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I've also had bosses that are infrequently in the office and make getting good information hard  EOS 3 0 17 how did you fix the issue? i work at home and its like just trying to reach out - they are always busy  EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren't always a reflection of us or how we're performing.  EOS 3 0 19 this whole covid thing has me scrambling to talk to a live person  EOS 3 1 20 [Others] I can imagine!  EOS 3 0 21 ok, so just keep pushing and getting good work done ?  EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] I was in a physical office when I had this problem, but the boss rotated between offices. It was hard to wait, but I just kept my head down until the next time she was available.  EOS 3 1 23 [Self-disclosure] That's what I did.  EOS 3 0 24 maybe i can try that.  EOS 3 0 25 thank you. i'll give it a shot  EOS 3 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think reminding yourself that if there was a problem with your work they would be seeking YOU out, and not the other way around.  EOS 3 0 27 hrm...that's a good point! i hadn't thought of it that way  EOS 3 1 28 [Reflection of feelings] Hopefully that mindset can help you stay positive until you have the chance to speak with them, instead of worrying about what you've done wrong.  EOS 3 1 29 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That anxiety feels like what is keeping you down?  EOS 3 0 30 i think that will work. it maybe what's keeping me down. i'll try yoga too. I'll give it a shot and just talk with him when i see him online next time. he isn't online that often because we have 2 separate computers each for our work  EOS 3 0 31 well...i hope you have a wonderful night! thank you for all your help!  EOS 3 1 32 [Information] I really hope that helps keep you afloat until you can get some real answers. Worrying about what-ifs is harder than just knowing what's goiong on!

EOS 3 0 35 thank you for your help! me too. i'll try what you have suggested and see if that doesn't work out well. who knows, maybe it just my project that i'm on.

EOS 2 1 24 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you seem like you have a good head on your shoulders!  EOS 2 0 25 True. But how do I learn to trust women without getting badly hurt again?

EOS 4 0 32 there was a project he wanted to do and it bothered him that it had not gotten done. Well, I was able to do it, because he had taught me enough to know what to do.  EOS 4 1 33 [Reflection of feelings] That is a positive in itself. Keep his legacy going through you  EOS 4 0 34 The look of pride in his face was priceless.  EOS 4 1 35 [Affirmation and Reassurance] And you have that memory to live by  EOS 4 0 36 The one thing I carry on because of him is my love for my church. He was on the church vestry (governing board). I am on my church worship team.  EOS 4 1 37 [Affirmation and Reassurance] His smile is in your heart and you can still feel him  EOS 4 0 38 I actually made church history, because I sing with the praise team (some churches call that a choir), but I sing many of the songs in American Sign Language.

EOS 4 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] See that there in itself is a reason to smile  EOS 4 0 41 2021 will be the 50 year anniversary of our congregation.

See you have a purpose  EOS 4 1 47 [Others] I imagine he is missing his big sister  EOS 4 0 48 My favorite story about signing in the church is how it began... I had asked to do it and had been shot down cold six times. Well, I laugh now, but at the time I was angry.  EOS 4 0 49 If you mean me, I'm male.  EOS 4 0 50 But the last time I was told I could not sign for the church, I told the elder who said no that God was going to give him a sign.  EOS 4 1 51 [Others] But your determination kept your dream alive.sorry big brother  EOS 4 1 52 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are a very determined person. Don't let the fire die inside your heart  EOS 4 0 53 Well, God delivered on the promise quickly. That same who morning we had a family visit who were on a road trip. They just were passing through but wanted to go to church while travelling.  EOS 4 1 54 [Reflection of feelings] The Lord is using you to each others/  EOS 4 0 55 They had a little girl about 6 or 7 years old who was Deaf. She saw me sitting in the back of the sanctuary signing the lyrics to the songs, and praying in Sign. Her face lit up and she started signing too.  EOS 4 0 56 At the end of the service, she found me and gave me a big hug around my legs and then looked up and said "I always wanted to go to a church where someone knew MY language!"  EOS 4 1 57 [Others] God placed you there for that little girl  EOS 4 0 58 From that point on, there was no problem with me signing in church.  EOS 4 0 59 I think He placed her there for me, also. It was a mutual deal.  EOS 4 0 60 There is no one in my congregation at the moment who signs, but I keep hoping for the future.  EOS 4 1 61 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have a calling on your life. Don't let the dream die

EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I hear you. Is there a particular reason why you might feel this way?  EOS 3 0 4 I don't know. I just don't have any energy. Life just has too many problems. It is too much weight to carry.  EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is it that your life is just getting so stressful and busy that work feels like the last straw? Correct me if I'm wrong.  EOS 3 0 6 I guess work itself isn't the problem. My job is a little boring, but not that bad. I think everything else in life is just too much. And it leaves me with no energy for anything else, like work.  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah, I understand that feeling completely. It's totally normal given the current situation and even without the whole virus situation, life is just tough.  EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you work in the mornings?  EOS 3 0 9 Yes, the virus doesn't help. And my parents have health problems which is scary. I start work in the morning. I work a normal 8 hour day, sometimes 9 or 10 hours.  EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Just from hearing that I can imagine your stress and how hard it must be to get through a single day.  EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Do you think it would be possible to get a day off or change your hours a bit?  EOS 3 0 12 Yes, it can be quite hard. Very exhausting.  EOS 3 0 13 Yes, I do have time off. I plan on taking 3 days off at the end of the month.  EOS 3 0 14 For a small getaway.  EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah, that could be exactly what you need!  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] I suggest you take that time to completely detox and get away from work and your problems  EOS 3 0 17 Yes, I think that will help. And time spent reading.

Give yourself something to look forward to  EOS 3 0 20 Yes, that does help me feel good. I wonder if morning exercise might help?  EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] For example, packing a bit of clothes each night or planning which places you'll visit  EOS 3 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes! Morning exercise will definitely help eliminate stress and make you feel better about your health and more comfortable  EOS 3 1 23 [Others] Take it slow and don't forget to breathe :)  EOS 3 0 24 Yes, that sounds nice.

EOS 4 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] See that there in itself is a reason to smile  EOS 4 0 41 2021 will be the 50 year anniversary of our congregation.

See you have a purpose  EOS 4 1 47 [Others] I imagine he is missing his big sister  EOS 4 0 48 My favorite story about signing in the church is how it began... I had asked to do it and had been shot down cold six times. Well, I laugh now, but at the time I was angry.  EOS 4 0 49 If you mean me, I'm male.  EOS 4 0 50 But the last time I was told I could not sign for the church, I told the elder who said no that God was going to give him a sign.

EOS 4 1 54 [Reflection of feelings] The Lord is using you to each others/  EOS 4 0 55 They had a little girl about 6 or 7 years old who was Deaf. She saw me sitting in the back of the sanctuary signing the lyrics to the songs, and praying in Sign. Her face lit up and she started signing too.  EOS 4 0 56 At the end of the service, she found me and gave me a big hug around my legs and then looked up and said "I always wanted to go to a church where someone knew MY language!"  EOS 4 1 57 [Others] God placed you there for that little girl  EOS 4 0 58 From that point on, there was no problem with me signing in church.  EOS 4 0 59 I think He placed her there for me, also.

EOS 4 1 61 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have a calling on your life. Don't let the dream die  EOS 4 0 62 No. That mission has been placed on my heart.

[contxt]	3 1 19 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations.  EOS 3 0 20 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately.  EOS 3 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner.  EOS 3 0 22 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?  EOS 3 1 23 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why.  EOS 3 0 24 That is a good point.  EOS 3 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens.  EOS 3 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that.  EOS 3 0 27 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage.  EOS 3 0 28 But I appreciate your suggestions  EOS 3 0 29 and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile  EOS 3 1 30 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand.  EOS 3 0 31 I should trust my partner more than any random person.  EOS 3 1 32 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.  EOS 3 1 33 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, trust matters.  EOS 3 0 34 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better?  EOS 3 1 35 [Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you....even after work.  EOS 3 0 36 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together.  EOS 3 1 37 [Providing Suggestions] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship.  EOS 3 1 38 [Providing Suggestions] Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.  EOS 3 0 39 That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance.  EOS 3 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign.  EOS 3 1 41 [Question] How old are the both of you?  EOS 3 0 42 Okay. I will keep that in mind.  EOS 3 0 43 We are 22.  EOS 3 1 44 [Question] Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis?  EOS 3 0 45 Yes but less over the past few months.  EOS 3 1 46 [Providing Suggestions] Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings.  EOS 3 1 47 [Providing Suggestions] I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related....for him.  EOS 3 1 48 [Question] Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young.  EOS 3 1 49 [Reflection of feelings] You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other.  EOS 3 0 50 That's understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first.  EOS 3 1 51 [Providing Suggestions] How do you all generally communicate? Through text?  EOS 3 0 52 He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends.  EOS 3 1 53 [Question] Which do you and your man like to communicate?  EOS 3 0 54 No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person.  EOS 3 0 55 I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something.  EOS 3 1 56 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot.  EOS 3 0 57 You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help.  EOS 3 1 58 [Providing Suggestions] I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. 
[reference_response]	i would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you.

[contxt]	2 0 4 Yes, so I have always done very well in school and university. I have always had A's or high B's. Last semester in university, I failed one of my exams. I still passed the class with an A, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams.  EOS 2 0 5 I don't know why it happens and it worries me  EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!!  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself?  EOS 2 0 8 Maybe, I got a 46% on the exam (so an F) but I did all my other assignments and exams almost perfect and got an A overall. I never once failed a test in my life, and have always held myself to a very high academic degree to make my parents proud  EOS 2 0 9 I come from a poor family, so succeeding in life is very important to m,e  EOS 2 0 10 me*  EOS 2 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life, would I be right in thinking this?

EOS 2 0 20 Oh? Charities?  EOS 2 1 21 [Others] Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you.  EOS 2 0 22 I have never heard of such people, I am interested  EOS 2 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Really though I think that your problem is self esteem .. you should think better of yourself :)  EOS 2 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you set yourself a very high standard but I also think that you need to be kind to yourself.  EOS 2 0 25 I think you're right, but I don't know, I'm still scared about having the bad dreams. I often wake up 2-3 times at night because of them.  EOS 2 1 26 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - this has been happening to me all of my life. Have you tried to take anything to help?

I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast  EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while  EOS 2 0 6 tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright :)  EOS 2 0 8 I have one and it helps sometimes. I try to meditate  EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently  EOS 2 0 10 i pretty much have to do it constantly  EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Not constantly. because then you won't have anytime to do anything else, but if negative thoughts always come into your head, maybe try doing something you enjoy doing  EOS 2 0 12 yeah maybe its as simple as that. I know Im the problem cause its very obvious that im the on ein control of the thoughts for the most part  EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Yeah, maybe. But always look at the bright side of stuff and maybe the negative thoughts can stop  EOS 2 0 14 right. I will try and start that more today and commit to it  EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes that's the spirit! And with that mind set good things will always come to you!  EOS 2 0 16 yes i agree. when i consistently use meditation and positive attitude, any bad things are defintely minimized  EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, as long as you keep focused and not divert into any other thoughts :)  EOS 2 0 18 yes. do you meditate? '  EOS 2 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I do it once a week and it really helps. I used to do it more often when I felt I couldn't do anything right, so always do it according to the situation  EOS 2 0 20 do you want to keep talking or should we wrap up? i could go either way  EOS 2 1 21 [Others] Yes  EOS 2 1 22 [Others] If you want to 
[reference_response]	if you want to

EOS 0 0 3 yes but more so not wanting to change due to uncertainty regarding what I may be walking into  EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this same position! Sometimes you have to take a leap, even though you are not sure what might happen. So far everything has worked out fine for me.  EOS 0 0 5 That's true. I just don't want to lose the benefits that I am currently entitled to at my current bad job  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] It is a tricky situation, to be sure. Have you talked to anyone else about it?  EOS 0 0 7 yes my wife, and she is supportive either way so that's not a problem  EOS 0 1 8 [Others] I am glad to hear that you have someone supportive in your life.

[contxt]	0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today?  EOS 0 0 2 I'm good, busy  EOS 0 0 3 I need another job to pay more bills  EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct?  EOS 0 0 5 yes somewhat. i can pay it off within 2-3 years without a second job. id like to pay it off faster though  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure it will take dedication and hard work, but I bet you can do it!  EOS 0 0 7 I think so. Im doing mturk for a second job right now. it helps some. i don't know about getting another job  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I've been in your shoes and also feel that's a good way to add a little extra income. It can really add up if left to built and used towards a specific goal.  EOS 0 0 9 I agree 100%. Been spending it on new clothes and toiletries lately to stock up for the covid shutdown. the extra money helps alot  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It definitely can help. Perhaps you could have a separate way of using some of the money to go towards some of the other bills you would like to pay off? Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns.  EOS 0 0 11 i currently do that. it's hard to have the patience to pay it off. i hate having debt hanging over my head. i like to have nice things though and they cost money  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Yes, and I have found this can be a good way to provide for the extra luxuries we like, without taking away from money that's used towards household bills.  EOS 0 0 13 absolutely. i make sure all of my household bills are paid every month. i think it will get better once these debts are paid off. i needed a lot of new things at once since the old had worn out.  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried to use some of the scripts that can be added that allows you to catch hits that are hard to get on Mturk? They can be very helpful. Also, there are forums that have all kinds of useful information for workers.  EOS 0 0 15 no i haven't tried those yet  EOS 0 0 16 do i have to pay for those scripts?  EOS 0 1 17 [Information] You might find it useful to do a little research and add them as extensions to Chrome or whatever browser you use. They are free and pretty simple to use.  EOS 0 0 18 So I could make more money on mturk than I am now by using those?  EOS 0 1 19 [Self-disclosure] They have helped me in being able to get a bit more extra income. The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It's easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc  EOS 0 0 20 oh wow, thank ya! I'll look into that  EOS 0 0 21 MTS is a script? Which script should I use?  EOS 0 1 22 [Others] Of course, I hope it can be of use too you! One I use is Mechanical Turk Suite, which is an extension. I think you can look up as a search for extensions, scripts etc. Or Mturk forums and find out tons of help! 
[reference_response]	of course, i hope it can be of use too you! one i use is mechanical turk suite, which is an extension. i think you can look up as a search for extensions, scripts etc. or mturk forums and find out tons of help!
[hypothesis_response]	i believe it'd be called " mturk scripts ". you can search the page and find it.

[contxt]	4 0 0 hello  EOS 4 0 1 i am so worried about my daughter  EOS 4 1 2 [Others] Hello  EOS 4 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear.  EOS 4 0 4 she has addictions and is living a very dangerous life  EOS 4 0 5 which makes me sad and anxious and angry all at once  EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is nerve wrecking. Did you try to comfort her and tell her that you are there to help her out.  EOS 4 0 7 yes, often  EOS 4 0 8 but she won't go for help, so i have had to be exceedingly patient  EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I love your patience level and would like to keep it going.  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Patience is the key and she will understand eventually. She will be ready to take help.  EOS 4 0 11 i will but it's such a heavy burden to carry. i try not to think about it much, but I carry it, you know? I Hope you are right about her wanting help eventually  EOS 4 0 12 in the meantime I don't know how to be so sad about this, maybe there is no way  EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] I understand your heavy burden however some kids face these problems and we as parents guide them so that they come out with flying colors.  EOS 4 0 14 indeed. and i have been holding up my end of the bargain. but it's so worrisome.  EOS 4 0 15 it sounds like you are encouraging me to have hope against all odds?  EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] You are a warrior and you need to fight off the worrisome and motivate yourself to help you kiddo.  EOS 4 0 17 CAn't help someone who doesn't want help though, but I do try to be there for her as best i can. She calls me up with terrible stories and I listen even though it pains me, because she needs someone to listen.  EOS 4 0 18 Addiction is an affliction I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy now that I have seen her living it  EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] Wow that is a good sign atleast she is coming to you to vent out. That is were you need to punch in an opportunity to seek help from a professional and convince her in such a way she will come down and accept it.  EOS 4 0 20 I have encouraged her to set up appointments with professionals. Sometimes she has, but does not follow through, the addiction gets in the way, it's more powerful than her desire to stop. And I can't just drive her/ accompany her to an appointment because she lives in a different city  EOS 4 0 21 But yes, I am happy she trusts me enough to confide in me  EOS 4 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] You have such a good heart so hang in there she will come to you with a bang.  EOS 4 0 23 i really appreciate your encouragement  EOS 4 0 24 i have been feeling worn down by it and your encouragement helps  EOS 4 0 25 have you any other suggestions for me?  EOS 4 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] Is there any way you could move to her city for a while and help her out. If so she will not skip any appointment and it will help her way.  EOS 4 0 27 unfortunately i cannot afford to move  EOS 4 0 28 the rents are too high in her city  EOS 4 1 29 [Providing Suggestions] That is understandable. Is there any option she can move in with you so you offer help. 
[reference_response]	that is understandable. is there any option she can move in with you so you offer help.

I think I guy I dated might still be interested. But there is another one who is interested now. But he hasn't stepped up yet. Not sure if I should forget about both of them and stay single  EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are struggling with deciding on your relationship with partners.  EOS 0 0 6 yeah. not sure if either one is worth it or not  EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's good you are asking yourself questions. What do you want out of the relationships?

[contxt]	3 0 2 am not feeling so good, being depressed feeling like killing myself, i don't know after all have done for her  EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] OK. This is a temporary feeling and it will pass. Please be kind to yourself.  EOS 3 1 4 [Question] What led to you feeling this way?  EOS 3 0 5 i proposed to my girl after 5 years of dating, she introduced me to one man claiming its her uncle, was very happy i had to meet one of my fiancé family not knowing all was but lies  EOS 3 0 6 she took me to go see the man, the man even gave us relationship advice  EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] OK. So you proposed to your girlfriend, but she was seeing another man?  EOS 3 0 8 yes!! seeing the so called man she called her uncle  EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] And the man you thought was her uncle was her other boyfriend?  EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] That is a horrible situation. It's not nice when people lie to you - I've had it happen to me before.  EOS 3 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] You must be feeling very betrayed at the moment.  EOS 3 0 12 caught them in the act, was devastated, my body was shaking, couldn't bear my eyes  EOS 3 0 13 its was as if my heart was being ripped outta my soul  EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] That sounds horrible. I think anyone would be upset with that!  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I wonder if it was best that this happened before you got married, though - it hurts, but it would have hurt more if she had become your wife. How does it feel if you think about it that way?  EOS 3 0 16 All i could do at that moment is pretend i didn't see a thing  EOS 3 0 17 yh! am happy i knew sooner  EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] How does your family and friends feel about it? Have you spoken to them?  EOS 3 0 19 but it s painful, i rented an apartment for her, was the one sponsoring her and her brother  EOS 3 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] You must feel as though she has taken advantage of you and your generosity.  EOS 3 0 21 i never had the courage to tell anyone, everything just kept eating me up  EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] I think it might be good to talk to people around you who knew you both.  EOS 3 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I know that it must be difficult because you feel like your pride has been hurt as well as your heart.  EOS 3 0 24 i provided everything i think a girl would need so she wont feel inferior but what did i get in returns  EOS 3 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are a very thoughtful and generous partner. I know that others will see that in you.  EOS 3 0 26 guessed i gave too much and it came back right at me  EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps you shopuld now focus on taking care of yourself. Did you neglect anything you need or enjoy to take care of her? Could you do that now? 
[reference_response]	perhaps you shopuld now focus on taking care of yourself. did you neglect anything you need or enjoy to take care of her? could you do that now?

[contxt]	3 0 5 My son's behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us  EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I'm sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband's loss of work and your son's loss of his job is entirely understandable.  EOS 3 0 7 I have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. It's hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future.  EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household.  EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] That is a really difficult position to be in.  EOS 3 0 10 My son is very defiant and argues with us about everything we try and get him to do, but he expects us to give him money for fun things that he wants to do when he isn't willing to work or even help out around the house  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Regardless of what your husband's actions are and your son's, could you possibly make the time to do things to support yourself, that even momentarily would provide you with some positive feelings?  EOS 3 0 12 I try to go for a run every night, that does help.  EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard emotionally, so I am sorry you have to deal with your son's behavior.  EOS 3 0 14 It is hard to keep my emotions separate from what is going on with him  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help. Even when it's difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help.  EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes being clear with your own expectations can help him to see what won't be accepted from him as long as he is living in your home.  EOS 3 0 17 Yes, I could do better at that. I want him to have fun and do things with friends, but I want him to be willing to work for what he wants, too.  EOS 3 0 18 I do struggle with expectations. I want him to be someone that he is not willing to be, I need to let go of that and just let him be himself and not base my emotions on his choices.  EOS 3 1 19 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand that. Especially when it comes to people we are close to, it can be hard to separate our expectations from theirs.  EOS 3 0 20 I feel guilty sometimes taking time to do things that I like and that are away from my family. I can see that I need to do that more, though.  EOS 3 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I've had to learn this lesson many times with my own children. It's difficult, but ultimately will give you some relief from your resentment.  EOS 3 0 22 Thank you, it is helpful to know that other people have felt the same way.  EOS 3 1 23 [Information] Absolutely! Being a parent is difficult. Remembering to support yourself helps. Making the time to do things to support your wellbeing doesn't make you selfish at all  EOS 3 0 24 Thank you!  EOS 3 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are certainly not alone.  EOS 3 1 26 [Others] Has any of this been helpful? Is there more I can do for you? 
[reference_response]	has any of this been helpful? is there more i can do for you?

If I may ask you a question, when did this start?  EOS 0 0 2 It has been for awhile.  EOS 0 0 3 about 3 months ago  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Were you feeling lonely before the virus came this year?  EOS 0 0 5 Not really. I had people to talk with  EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds that you are feeling lonely because you cannot talk to people face to face. Do I have that right?  EOS 0 0 7 I WFH. I am a writer  EOS 0 0 8 Basically because I can not at least have the nise of the people around me at times  EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I WFH as well.

I dont know how I am going to get the kids presents  EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Is there anyone you are able to ask for support right now, like your parents?

EOS 0 0 9 I have my sister who lives far away  EOS 0 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I see. And your kids are depending on you to be able to take care of them.

EOS 0 0 15 Its off and on. Some days are better than others.  EOS 0 0 16 I think its just the weather . Its cold.

EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] It seems like a little thing, but I find that taking Vitamin D supplements when the weather is bad helps me not to get depressed.

EOS 4 0 5 probably not. or at least i dont see that happening in the near future  EOS 4 0 6 they cheated on me  EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I remember when my partner left me after eight years I felt that I was never going to get over it.

EOS 4 0 18 Those are very helpful ideas..Thank you very much.I will try for sure.  EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] You are welcome. Sometimes you will pay as little as 0-$20 a session.

EOS 4 0 21 Any opinions that I can consider?  EOS 4 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] You have to find what is available. Avoid big buildings full of psychologists, usually the more independent practices are reasonable and provide better service IMO.  EOS 4 0 23 What kind of therapies are useful and beneficial to me in my situation.  EOS 4 1 24 [Information] Probably someone to talk to, so just a counselor or therapist fits the bill. I am not a doctor so don't take anything I say as medical advice btw.

EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm so sorry to hear that.  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] What is wrong?  EOS 3 0 6 just blue. not anything in particular.  EOS 3 0 7 this time of year the days get so short... the darkness comes early. and it makes me blue.  EOS 3 1 8 [Information] definitely. The short days make it so hard to smile. Your body needs sun. There are ways to cheer yourself up though!  EOS 3 0 9 staring a a computer all day is probably not one of the ways...  EOS 3 0 10 what makes you smile  EOS 3 0 11 the crack of the top of a creme brule?  EOS 3 0 12 the smell of autumn leaves?  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] Oh definitely doesn't help but I understand. Working on a computer all day is really hard . I do that too. I try to get myself away from the computer for at least a hour to do something i enjoy  EOS 3 1 14 [Question] What do you enjoy?  EOS 3 0 15 the sound of a trumpet in the distance ...  EOS 3 0 16 being surprised and delighted by a smell from my childhood...  EOS 3 0 17 these are rare things  EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] That's true but there have to be every day things that you could enjoy. Do you enjoy any exercises?  EOS 3 0 19 hmm  EOS 3 1 20 [Information] Exercise is a great way to release endorphins which very much makes you happier.  EOS 3 0 21 i like to take walks. but my pace is fairly slow.  EOS 3 0 22 im not one for chin ups or pick up basketball or things like that  EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] That's okay!!! you should try to take a 30 minute walk every day. That's actually what i do to stay sane.  EOS 3 0 24 i frequently walk for hours... with no where to go...  EOS 3 1 25 [Question] You don't need a destination. Does walking help you at all?  EOS 3 1 26 [Question] What about connecting with otehr people ?  EOS 3 0 27 umm... deadly pandemic... i don;t get near other people...  EOS 3 1 28 [Self-disclosure] What about virtually? I've been quarantined because I live with someone immunocompromised but I try to have phone or video calls with people regularly.  EOS 3 0 29 what do you do on your video calls? just look at each other and talk about being at home?  EOS 3 1 30 [Providing Suggestions] We talk, there are also online games you can play with other people. We cooked together last week and made cocktails.  EOS 3 0 31 that sounds nice  EOS 3 0 32 i think we have hit our 15 minutes. Thank you - you seem nice.  EOS 3 1 33 [Others] You do as welL!! i hope you feel better soon!!!!

[contxt]	2 0 0 Hello  EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hi, How are you?  EOS 2 0 2 I am feeling down and scared.  EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What is having you feel scared at this moment?  EOS 2 0 4 The ongoing pandemic and my financial situation. I am unemployed and I don't know when I will be able to get a job.  EOS 2 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Not having a job can feel overwhelming, especially on top of this pandemic.  EOS 2 1 6 [Question] Have you been able to apply for work recently?  EOS 2 0 7 Yes I have been applying but have not gotten any responses. I imagine a lot of people are competing for jobs.  EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] you are right about others looking for work too. Are you signed up with many job seeking apps?  EOS 2 0 9 I have not been using apps. I use websites and look for jobs there. It is making me feel like I am not qualified enough.  EOS 2 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Feelings of insufficiency can be such a stumbling block when looking for work. It is obvious that you are putting forth great effort.  EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Do you think getting in contact with a job agency in your area would be beneficial to you?  EOS 2 0 12 I have not contacted a job agency. I don't have experience with them. That is a good idea.  EOS 2 1 13 [Information] Perhaps there are a few agencies in your area to help and you can maximize your opportunities.  EOS 2 1 14 [Question] You mentioned feeling down in the beginning of the conversation, would you like to talk about that?  EOS 2 0 15 Yes I am going to look. It will increase my chances of finding work.  EOS 2 0 16 It doesn't help that I live with my parents and because I have no work I spend most of my time at home and get into arguments with them.  EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Tension can be high when you already feel stressed about the job situation. 
[reference_response]	tension can be high when you already feel stressed about the job situation.
[hypothesis_response]	i understand how you feel, and it's hard to feel that way when you are in a financial situation where you can't afford to live with your parents. have you considered looking for another job?

[contxt]	7 0 1 not so great  EOS 7 1 2 [Question] I am sorry to hear that! What seems to be bothering you?  EOS 7 0 3 I have a real fear of public speaking and I am in a college class that requires me to do this in a large group relatively soon  EOS 7 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand your anxiety. I hate public speaking too. Is this a required class?  EOS 7 0 5 Yes i am taking the class this semester and my presentation is due next week  EOS 7 0 6 have you done any public speaking  EOS 7 1 7 [Question] Only required in high school luckily in college I didn't have to do public speaking . What is your major ? I mean it sounds like this is a part of your major  EOS 7 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Either way it is EXTREMELY stressful and I would hate it  EOS 7 0 9 I am a psychology major and while i am great at interacting with others to help them through thier feelings and any problems or difficulties that may be facing, this one is just different for me.  EOS 7 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I can tell this is challenging for you. May I suggest talking with your professor maybe you could pre record your speech and play it instead of actually doing it? Or maybe practicing with some friends or collegues and seeing if they would help you not be so nervous  EOS 7 0 11 I do not really have any friends I am online student and the presentation is being held on campus at the university and there are no other ways around the public speaking  EOS 7 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] This is certainly a difficult time and a unique one. How about searching online for speech public speaking tips and or training type videos or even libraries some have online books/videos  EOS 7 1 13 [Others] I would be willing to do a zoom meeting and practice with you if you would like  EOS 7 0 14 I have done everything I can think of to prepare for this. I have been meditating to try and overcome this fear. I have spoken about my anxiety to my partner and family as well.  EOS 7 1 15 [Others] I am sure there are some support groups out there you could search for maybe. Also prayer works if you believe in God as I do!  EOS 7 0 16 I am not as anxious on video, just mainly in person in crowds of peopole  EOS 7 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] I understand better now sorry for the confusion

[contxt]	6 0 7 And the pandemic has shifted the markets a lot and i don't think my skills are relevent anymore  EOS 6 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Yeah, sometimes job postings feel fake. In the past, I've found various jobs online. Sometimes it takes a while but if you keeping putting out applications, something good will come your way eventually  EOS 6 0 9 Thanks for listening and your kind encouragement  EOS 6 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you're worried about your skillset. Is there any way you can improve or learn new things?  EOS 6 0 11 I was in physical retail before  EOS 6 0 12 But now and even after the pandemic will all shift to ecommerce  EOS 6 0 13 I am not sure if I can acquire new skills  EOS 6 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You seem like a bright, open minded person. I think you could learn a lot in a new role. There are many online retailers that could be a great opportunity.  EOS 6 0 15 My sister works for Amazon and tried to put me forward twice but just no luck.  EOS 6 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] There are still many brick and mortar stores that will open after the pandemic is over, hopefully that will bring opportunity.  EOS 6 0 17 I tried to stay hopeful.  EOS 6 0 18 how about you? why did you pick to be a supporter?  EOS 6 0 19 You are very nice by the way.  EOS 6 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Are you interested in taking any classes to improve your skillset? There are many free courses available online.  EOS 6 0 21 Yes, I used coursea and also learning French.  EOS 6 1 22 [Others] Thank you, I enjoy talking with people and helping them in any way I can  EOS 6 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow, learning french must be fun. If you can learn another language, I have faith you can learn new skills for a job. That's really great, good for you!  EOS 6 0 24 Yes, the Duolingo app is quite good.  EOS 6 0 25 I worked for a French company for 8 years, just never really get to pick up until now I am unemployed.  EOS 6 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] Learning new languages can open up new opportunities for work. It is unique to be bilingual. Make sure to put all your unique attributes, such as learning french, on your resume. It might help!  EOS 6 0 27 Thats a good suggestion, I can't really hold a conversation in French yet. But when I do, I would put that into my skillset. I don't want to fake any skills  EOS 6 1 28 [Question] Are there any other fields of work you are interested in working besides retail?  EOS 6 0 29 I know a lot of people do and basically AI are screening all the resume which I don't think I did a very good job in catering to that. But integrity is very important to me.  EOS 6 0 30 I am also close to L&D, HR.  EOS 6 1 31 [Providing Suggestions] I would recommend calling the company or searching for a contact via LinkedIn or just google and trying to make a connection there. LinkedIn has helped me many times in the past when I'm applying for jobs.  EOS 6 0 32 I am thinking may be I should learn an loan or real estate licenses  EOS 6 0 33 Thats wonderful to hear for your great experience. I do use LinkedIn but not much on job applications.  EOS 6 0 34 Did you pay for the premium package on LinkedIn?  EOS 6 1 35 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Earning a license for loans or for real estate sounds like a great way to add to your skillset.  EOS 6 1 36 [Self-disclosure] No, I do not have the premium package 
[reference_response]	no, i do not have the premium package
[hypothesis_response]	i had to pay for a premium package. i was able to get my license and help people get jobs. i also learned a lot from linkeden. i would highly recommend you learn some skills!

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hi there, I'm struggling to be honest.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] What are you struggling with?  EOS 3 0 3 I've been finding it really hard to motivate myself to do anything for the last year or so, but it's been getting worse recently. Everything feels like hard work.  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] To be honest, I feel the same way sometimes, too. It is nice to have someone to talk to about this. Have you talked to anyone else about this yet?  EOS 3 0 5 I haven't really, I feel like other people have their own issues and I don't want to burden them. It's good that others feel the same. Do you have any advice on what makes you feel better?  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Yes. I agree. For me personally, I noticed if I think back of a time before I lost my motivation, sometimes it helps me to reenergize a bit.  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] What have motivated you in the past?  EOS 3 0 8 Hmm, I'm finding it hard to remember a time I didn't feel like this! I feel like this has been going on forever! I used to enjoy walking, and generally getting things done around the house. I am also self employed and loved putting time into my business but I've been finding that hard recently.  EOS 3 0 9 I've been watching a lot of Netflix and youtube and not doing much else.  EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have been spending a lot of time home by myself as well.  EOS 3 0 11 How do you cope with it? How do you not get bored and restless?  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I noticed if I try to adhere to a schedule, even a very simple one, such as getting up at a certain time, making breakfast, and showering. My days tend to go better.  EOS 3 0 13 I've been finding I have a lot of time alone with my thoughts recently.  EOS 3 0 14 That's a good idea, I could try that. At the moment I get up at around 11am but U have been trying to get up earlier but I just can't make myself do it. I've also been sleeping during the day which is maybe not good.  EOS 3 1 15 [Question] Have you tried reading? I find reading motivates me sometimes, too. Sometimes too much thinking alone leaves me digging a hole for myself. 
[reference_response]	have you tried reading? i find reading motivates me sometimes, too. sometimes too much thinking alone leaves me digging a hole for myself.
[hypothesis_response]	yes, i have had to go to bed early.
[comet query]	That's a good idea, I could try that. At the moment I get up at around 11am but U have been trying to get up earlier but I just can't make myself do it. I've also been sleeping during the day which is maybe not good.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Yes, in my adolescense I suffered from bullying. I consider  EOS 3 0 2 great impact in my life  EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you saying that you are feeling hurt and made to feel bad by other people, does that sound right?  EOS 3 0 4 yes  EOS 3 1 5 [Others] Has this been happening to you for a long time?  EOS 3 0 6 It happened in my teens, but it still impacts me  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are a very strong person for reaching out and expressing your feelings. You have a lot to be proud of!  EOS 3 0 8 They were very harsh, with me.. just like my parents  EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] You were put in a very difficult situation with multiple people. I can imagine that you have been so stressed out from the pressure of people hurting you.  EOS 3 0 10 Thats how it is... what do you think i should do to overcome it?  EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I had this same problem in school and as I grew up I learned how to speak up and defend myself when people were rude and mean to me. I was my own advocate and you are also being your own by reaching out today and being so strong.  EOS 3 0 12 What did they tell you?  EOS 3 1 13 [Others] I was told that I was overweight by others. I was able to defend myself by saying that I am a good person with a good heart and they are not important to me and neither are their opinions. I became more confident in myself. Have you ever wrote your feelings down in a journal?  EOS 3 0 14 I think we suffer the same  EOS 3 0 15 I have never written my feelings  EOS 3 1 16 [Information] Yes, I agree. A lot of research shows that when we write down our positive attributes we reaffirm our belief in ourselves. Listing the things are are good at can help give you more self confidence.  EOS 3 0 17 Good, thanks  EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] You're welcome, some people express themselves through email and can help to communicate your feelings to someone.  EOS 3 1 19 [Others] Thank you for sharing with me today.  EOS 3 0 20 i would like to, i like to vent  EOS 3 0 21 Are you a Psychologist?

It was hard and strong to be able to study there, after that they changed my school, everything was fine until those from the previous school found out where I was studying and the bullying started again. It has had an impact on my life, I believe that even my feelings are the same, I have not been able to forget it.

EOS 4 0 9 We have done a few video calls but it just makes me more sad that I can't see them in person  EOS 4 1 10 [Information] okay. at lease seeing them in the video should have brought you some relief. Are you planning to get vaccinated when you are able to? And what about your friends? once you are vaccinated, it will help you meet your friends in person.  EOS 4 0 11 Yes we are planning to get it as soon as possible but that is hard in our state  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] oh okay.

[contxt]	1 0 1 I am feeling very upset because of my situation.  EOS 1 1 2 [Information] would you like to tell me more about it?  EOS 1 0 3 Yes. My friend, M, is my oldest friend and knows me the best. If I can't turn to her for help, then who can I turn to?  EOS 1 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel you can't turn to your friend?  EOS 1 0 5 She is always so depressed herself. She is too tired, she is too sad, she is too frustrated. Everyone has hard lives, but we all do our best to deal with it. I have a child with special needs and I need help too, but she never thinks to ask about me and see if I am not doing okay  EOS 1 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] I am sorry to hear that sounds like she sure could use some help as well. Have you tried first taking about her issues and then telling her about yours?  EOS 1 0 7 I talk about her issues constantly. I guess I could do a better job about letting her know when I am feeling down. I just ask her to do things with me instead, but maybe she just takes it at face value. Literally everytime we talk though, it's about her problems.  EOS 1 0 8 But she never does anything to try and fix them.  EOS 1 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to her that, so it sounds like you feel you need to give her help but you dont get any from her. But is also sounds like she might not be aware of you needing help.  EOS 1 0 10 Yes, exactly.  EOS 1 0 11 It would be nice if I didn't have to explicitly spell it out. It makes it seem less meaningful when I have to spoonfeed to her what is wrong and what I need her to do for me.  EOS 1 1 12 [Others] I think you need to try to tell her about your problems, and maybe even if she feels like she is helping you she is more inclined to help herself some too?  EOS 1 0 13 That's true, I didn't think about that really. Helping others def can help to take the focus off of yourself.  EOS 1 1 14 [Others] I know, it would be nice of her to ask how are you? But maybe she thinks you are a very strong person that does not need help since you do not voice it.? 
[reference_response]	i know, it would be nice of her to ask how are you? but maybe she thinks you are a very strong person that does not need help since you do not voice it.?
[hypothesis_response]	have you asked her if you could talk to her about it and then tell her how much you really want her to help you?

[situation]	I asked my friend if she would go to the store with me because I was feeling down and overwhelmed with kids. She said she was too tired so she would have to pass this time. I was angry because I always support her when she is down or needs it. When I need it, she is nowhere to be seen. It's okay I guess for her to be depressed, but no one else can, because she has already monopolized that emotion. How can you ask someone for help when you are feeling depressed when they are depressed themselves?

EOS 1 0 3 My family was intending to get together for the Christmas season, but we had to cancel our plans.  EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I'm sorry to hear that, will you be spending the holidays with anyone?  EOS 1 0 5 I will be able to spend it with my mom, but I've basically been planning this trip for an entire year.  EOS 1 1 6 [Question] Do you live far away from your family?  EOS 1 0 7 Plane tickets & everything, but COVID-19 has made me cancel all of these plans. Just annoyed and frustrated.  EOS 1 0 8 We live in Chicago & they live in Boston  EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that, covid has messed with so much this year.  EOS 1 0 10 It's also cut into a few of my hobbies too. It amazes me how this year has turned out  EOS 1 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Yeah, it's been a struggle for sure. I think not knowing how long we're going to be in this state of uncertainty is what makes it more difficult.  EOS 1 0 12 I'm glad that you understand. I feel like I'm not the only one anymore  EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I try to find the positives, which I'll admit get harder to find by the day. But trying to embrace a more simplistic lifestyle, being more present, etc.  EOS 1 0 14 Yeah, being couped up in the house all day has been testing my patience  EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Yeah, we're not far from Chicago and the weather doesn't look like it's going to change that for a bit.  EOS 1 0 16 I thought things were pretty complicated back then, but this is definitely simplified my choices, lol  EOS 1 0 17 Very windy today for me. I wanted to take my dog out for a walk & cheer up her day, but it's a little too windy for me here  EOS 1 1 18 [Others] Same here, I'd love to get outside as it usually makes me feel better but wind today and subzero chills tomorrow don't look promising.

I appreciate the headsup  EOS 1 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] But hey, tomorrow's Christmas eve, maybe you can zoom with some of your Boston family and try something new.

EOS 0 0 2 I don't have close friends because I don't trust people  EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said you generally don't trust family or people in general?  EOS 0 0 4 people in general, I do trust certain family members  EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just people who are close to you?  EOS 0 0 6 no, I have a hard time trusting people i don't know in order to make friends  EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I have had a hard time trusting strangers, but that is not a big problem.  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I used to be the same way, but I learned about how to make and keep close friends.  EOS 0 0 9 i think it feels like a problem because I never let anyone too close in order to make friends and have an external support system  EOS 0 0 10 how did you do it  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I joined volunteer groups to help others. I made friends with like-minded people who volunteered to make a difference.  EOS 0 0 12 I actually think that is a great idea. I have never thought of doing that for that specific purpose.  EOS 0 1 13 [Information] Groups like Habitat for Humanity or UNICEF will help you to build long-lasting friendships.  EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It just takes finding the right volunteer groups and being willing to be pro-active.  EOS 0 0 15 I guess it makes a lot of sense. If you go to a party or a bar, you don't know what you will get, as it is a mixed bag of personalities. Whereas if you go to something like what you suggested then you already know that the people you meet have the same kind of heart.  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can do it. I have faith that you can use volunteering as the right method.  EOS 0 0 17 Thank you for that suggestion, that is really helpful and something that I will take with me from now on.  EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Exactly, volunteering is a great option. And there are many organizations to join.

EOS 0 1 4 [Question] i see. have you sought out any medical help with the back pain?  EOS 0 0 5 Yes, I was supposed to have surgery for it, but it has been cancelled because the hospitals are full due to the coronavirus.  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yeah, this pandemic has thrown a wrench into many people's plans, but hopefully things will ease up soon.  EOS 0 0 7 I hope so too, but it looks like it's going to be a long time.  EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it is a bit daunting when we see the number of infections increasing and people getting sick, but i think it will just be a matter of time before things get better. and hopefully a vaccine will help with the hospitalizations  EOS 0 0 9 Hopefully, but how to deal with it in the mean time?  EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i think you're already taking a step in the right direction by talking to me about your anxiety and depression. i'm amazed that you've been able to just deal with it for 8 years  EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] i've had friends who suffered from anxiety and depression, and i've noticed that just talking things through can sometimes help a lot  EOS 0 0 12 It's been very hard, I've also had to take care of my mother in that time period, but she sadly passed away last march, possibly from the virus and I've been having a hard time processing that grief.  EOS 0 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] i'm very sorry to hear about your mother's passing, and a significant loss like that can take some time to process  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] from my experience, it really helps just to open up to someone about the things that are on your mind. even a journal can help. if you have someone who can lend an ear to listen and a shoulder to cry on, spending some time with them can help you get your feelings out and might give you a sense of relief  EOS 0 0 15 That's true, I know many are suffering so much right now and many people have also lost their loved ones. It makes the isolation all the harder trying to handle the grief. It does help to talk, thank you. Do you have any suggestions on how to handle the anxiety?  EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] personally, i find that hobbies are great for getting your mind off things and keeping yourself occupied means that your mind doesn't wander into dark thoughts  EOS 0 0 17 That is good advice, I will try to stay busier.

EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] just from this limited conversation, it sounds like you're an amazing person and i sincerely commend you for seeking help here and pushing yourself to cope with you loss and pain. i really wish there was more i could do to help but i believe in you ;)  EOS 0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] this might sound silly, but reddit is a great resource. there are some great support groups there who help each other and lift people up

[contxt]	3 0 3 I think that might be true. Can you offer any advice or guidance on what I can do to improve it?  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i think a lot of people are feeling that way. covid has really changed up everyone's lives, and it is hard to make drastic changes like we all have.  EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] if y ou have health insurance you can always look into therapy or antidepressants  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] there are also free sites like 7 cups that does peer to peer supprt  EOS 3 0 7 Yeah my issues have definitely been compounded by the crisis, and not being able to speak to my friends or family, or even my work colleagues now I work from home. I don't have health insurance unfortunately, otherwise I'd have gone down that route.  EOS 3 1 8 [Information] sometimes talking to people even through chat can make us feel less lonely and change things up a bit  EOS 3 0 9 7 cups, I haven't heard of that one. What do they do?  EOS 3 0 10 Definitely even this conversation is making me feel a little better.  EOS 3 1 11 [Information] peer to peer support. you can. try to google it!  EOS 3 0 12 I will look into it after this conversation then. Is there anything you could recommend I try before I contact them? Just anything I can do to lift my spirits?  EOS 3 1 13 [Information] if you google lemonaid health that is a doctor you can see virtually its prettty cheap less than a hundres a month for a doctor and meds!  EOS 3 0 14 Do you think meds are a good option? I'm worried if I take that route I might end up zoned out or addicted to taking them.  EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] when i am feeling down i like to go sit outside. vitamin d that we get from the sun is really importnat. i am inside a lot. i have had to start taking a supplement and it helps!  EOS 3 1 16 [Information] i've been onn and off antidppressants for about twenty years. antidepressants work with natural chemicals in your brain they are not addictive because they are not narcotic  EOS 3 0 17 Okay sure, so I could just go to my local pharmacy and pick up Vitamin D? Or is that prescribed by a doctor?  EOS 3 0 18 Okay that's good to know you have first hand experience.  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] you can look an amazon for herbal or natural options .st johns wort is a good one  EOS 3 0 20 Okay, what does that do? I havent heard of that supplement before.  EOS 3 1 21 [Information] vitamin d d is over the counter! any pharmacy, amazon, its easy to find and cheap  EOS 3 1 22 [Others] my friend swears by st johns wort. its some herb that is a natural anti depressant. you could do some research and see!  EOS 3 0 23 Okay that's useful. And there are no side effects to taking vitamin D, are there? I'll look into st john's wort. It seems as though there is loads of research to be done here - which is a little stressful!  EOS 3 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] it can be stressful but a positive stress. remember you are researching how to help yourself and feel better!

EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Are you getting any sort of treatment for it? There are some effective treatments out there.  EOS 4 0 7 I actually just talked to my doctor today, I am going to track my triggers and see if we can figure out why I am getting them. Also some meds for the symptoms.  EOS 4 1 8 [Question] That sounds really productive. Do you think that the attacks might be stress related in some way?  EOS 4 0 9 It could be but they seem to happen more on weekends so that doesn't really make sense.  EOS 4 1 10 [Question] Hmm yes I can see how that does not make any sense. Do you have any other medical issues?  EOS 4 0 11 No I am in pretty good health, a bit of sciatica from a few years back but that only flares up occasionally.

EOS 4 0 10 That's too bad.I suppose that one should be able to let the other person know when you no ;longer want to be friends with them.That way one can move on quickly.

[contxt]	3 0 22 My stupid emotions are clouding things.  EOS 3 1 23 [Others] Well, if you were to give him an ultimatum what do you think he would say?  EOS 3 0 24 I did.  EOS 3 0 25 LOL  EOS 3 1 26 [Question] And he's still married?  EOS 3 0 27 And he brought his kids to my house so they could meet my kids. He had a conversation with them about why he and their mother had been living the way they had. (in seperate floors of the house)  EOS 3 0 28 That was two weeks ago.  EOS 3 0 29 So, yes, he is.  EOS 3 0 30 Too soon to tell.  EOS 3 1 31 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you feel that you are being cheated here. I can't tell you what to do but don't you think you deserve better?  EOS 3 0 32 I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out. Should I give him time to prove himself now that he's backed into a corner.  EOS 3 1 33 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's not for me to say but I wonder if he's really going to change as he has not already.  EOS 3 0 34 That's not an easy question to answer. He treats me very well. Always has. And he is frantically trying to accomodate me, now htat I know.  EOS 3 0 35 I agree with you. It's one of my fears.  EOS 3 1 36 [Question] How do your children feel about this? And his?  EOS 3 0 37 MY children (6 and 9) have been living with him in their lives as a male figure who is growing into a father figure. He and I have been together for fifteen months, and part-time living together for six.  EOS 3 0 38 This isn't a new relationship. That's part of the complication, too.  EOS 3 0 39 His kids actually asked if they could come live with me while he and his (ex?) figured their shit out.  EOS 3 1 40 [Question] Yes, I can imagine that it is. It is always really difficult when children are involved. I know you would not want your children to be hurt  EOS 3 0 41 It's a messed up situation that COVID has not improved. He was furloughed in May.  EOS 3 0 42 Indeed I don't, you're right.  EOS 3 1 43 [Self-disclosure] I hear you. Covid has disrupted the whole world so might this year! I can't wait for it to be over.  EOS 3 0 44 But now it seems like it will hurt them if I break up with him.  EOS 3 1 45 [Others] But it will hurt them more the longer the situation goes on :(  EOS 3 0 46 I wish I could say that I were confident that 2021 would be better, but...  EOS 3 0 47 Too right.  EOS 3 0 48 And this is all a part of why this is not a simple situation.  EOS 3 1 49 [Others] Well it surely could not be worse :)  EOS 3 0 50 I have no doubt that he loves me very much.  EOS 3 0 51 Hahahaha! Seems that way.  EOS 3 0 52 He didn't make this lie up for me. That's an interesting thing.  EOS 3 0 53 He was living the "divorced dad" lie to A LOT of people.

We all showed up to work Friday hungover, and he just made lots of comments and jokes to play the part, but you can tell he is looking at me and everyone different. I do not know how to redeem myself.  EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] I would recommend speaking with him privately about the issue one on one  EOS 2 0 7 That sounds a lot easier said than done. I was the one who was the most drunk. But I do now know if he knows how drunk we all got since he left after one of us got hit in the face with a golf club and had to take her to the ER. So what if I say too much and apologize for what he does not know.  EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] have you tried reaching out a company hotline or maybe an hr department in your company to speak about this issue anonymously this could help with the tension between you and your boss

I don't have any motivation to do anything and I'm not sure exactly where to turn.  EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] it sounds like you are a little depressed  EOS 3 0 3 I think that might be true. Can you offer any advice or guidance on what I can do to improve it?  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i think a lot of people are feeling that way. covid has really changed up everyone's lives, and it is hard to make drastic changes like we all have.

EOS 3 0 14 Do you think meds are a good option? I'm worried if I take that route I might end up zoned out or addicted to taking them.  EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] when i am feeling down i like to go sit outside. vitamin d that we get from the sun is really importnat. i am inside a lot. i have had to start taking a supplement and it helps!  EOS 3 1 16 [Information] i've been onn and off antidppressants for about twenty years. antidepressants work with natural chemicals in your brain they are not addictive because they are not narcotic  EOS 3 0 17 Okay sure, so I could just go to my local pharmacy and pick up Vitamin D?

EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see. It sound like your bothered by that.

EOS 1 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's good that you've moved passed it.  EOS 1 0 22 Called it quits  EOS 1 1 23 [Question] Are you happy with your decision?  EOS 1 0 24 Took me a long time tho to get over it  EOS 1 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It takes time for trust wounds to heal but you've handle it greatly.  EOS 1 0 26 Yes all things being equal i believe that was the right thing to do. considering relationships cannot work without some form of trust  EOS 1 1 27 [Question] Good for you!

[contxt]	3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Would you be able to go and visit friends or family members? Get some support?  EOS 3 0 7 My family is out of town. My friends were also his friends and he told lies about me so they wont talk to me. I want to just get drunk and go to sleep.  EOS 3 1 8 [Information] Oh that is not a good idea. Do you think you have an alcohol problem? There are support groups out there who could help you.  EOS 3 0 9 I never drink alone but I feel so bad now and afraid of being alone.  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I hear you. Do you have any pets or anything at all to keep you company?  EOS 3 0 11 Do you think I should call him and ask him to come back? He took our dog.  EOS 3 1 12 [Others] I think you should get the dog back but I don't think you should call your ex - you are better off without him.  EOS 3 0 13 But I still love him. He did sleep with my best friend, but he said it didn’t mean anything. I really miss him,  EOS 3 1 14 [Others] I think you should value yourself more highly than this. If he slept with your best friend then he is nothing.  EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can do a great deal better, I am sure!  EOS 3 0 16 Thanks. You are right, I am too good for him. I had a job and he doesn’t.  EOS 3 1 17 [Others] Well quite! You can easily move forward with your life. He will not find it so easy. But do get the dog back.  EOS 3 0 18 Yeah, I need the dog. He gave it to me as a puppy for my birthday. I can’t believe he took it.  EOS 3 1 19 [Information] Do you know that there are legal organisations out there that will help you get it back?  EOS 3 0 20 But I am still having a hard time getting to sleep, I am so upset. I have been crying for hours.  EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] I suggest you have a nice warm bath and a cup of cocoa and try to relax  EOS 3 0 22 Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. A bubble bath and some warm coco. That always make me feel better  EOS 3 1 23 [Information] Tomorrow you can try to think of how to go on with things :). Contact some legal aid people to help you get your dog back for one.  EOS 3 0 24 My cousin works for legal aid, maybe she can help me give me advice. Thanks  EOS 3 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds perfect!

[contxt]	4 0 1 I am a mom of three boys and I work a full time job. I feel like if I didn’t have my kids to take care of I would run away and start a new life somewhere else  EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can see how you have a lot on your plate. Yo must get very exhausted.  EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Are you wanting to run away alone or move away on your own? Do you feel trapped when you say you want a new life?  EOS 4 0 4 I am. My husband just got laid off at his job, but he didn’t really help with bills anyway. I’m just so depressed and I feel like I’m going to go crazy and no one even cares  EOS 4 1 5 [Question] Wow, that is a lot of pressure that you have to endure. Do you feel like you have anyone in your life who cares and listens?  EOS 4 0 6 I could never leave my kids. But sometimes I feel like it would be so much easier to just be dead  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am really thankful that you reached out today and I am happy that you are here with me today. You are making a lot of sense and I appreciate you opening up.  EOS 4 0 8 My mom cares, but she is having a lot of health problems so I don’t feel like I should bother her with my problems  EOS 4 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Have you been able to tell any friends how you are feeling and how alone you feel?  EOS 4 0 10 No. I have stopped talking to my friends and just kept to myself. I don’t think they even understand how I feel  EOS 4 1 11 [Others] I can understand how you feel. I live in a new town and dont have any friends here and it can be very lonely and isolating. Do you have any hobbies or do you have any time for yourself?  EOS 4 0 12 I just want to hide in a hole and not talk to anyone  EOS 4 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have felt that way before and I reached out for help like you are today. I was so depressed that I need to start therapy.  EOS 4 0 14 I’ve been listening to a lot of audio books, it’s a nice escape  EOS 4 0 15 I wish I could afford a therapist  EOS 4 1 16 [Information] Do you ever write in a journal or are you able to exercise alone? Both of those can begin a path to healing.  EOS 4 0 17 I was trying to exercise 5 times a week but when I feel depressed I can’t seem to summon the energy to exercise  EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I can relate to that. Maybe you can start with journaling and writing out your feelings and thoughts. They may help clear your mind especially in the evenings.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hi there I was hoping you can help me.  EOS 3 1 2 [Information] Sure. What can I help you with?  EOS 3 0 3 Well you see I am heartbroken and I can't seem to move on from a previous relationship, and its been over two years. Do you have any advice?  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I’m understand how hard ending a relationship can be.  EOS 3 1 5 [Information] What do you find is the hardest thing for you each day. That is, where do you find it hardest to move on?  EOS 3 0 6 Well I would say mentally because I frequently think about her and constantly have memories throughout the day. Also when i hear a certain song or see a restaurant it makes me think of her.  EOS 3 1 7 [Information] Memories are a blessing and a curse. Are the memories and thought you are having positive or negative?  EOS 3 0 8 They are a mix of both because at one point they were positive and now when I think about it, it brings me down in a negative way.  EOS 3 0 9 What have you done in the past to help you move on from a break up?  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It’s hard when we have various emotions. These memories being more negative are hard to cope with. In my experience, if I rethink memories regarding relationships which tend to bring me down in way that is a learning experience, I feel more empowered.  EOS 3 0 11 Yeah I agree that's what I have been doing too, and it's nice to know that you do the same.  EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] In my past I have been able to try and look at each relationship as a chance to grow. To figure out what worked with that person and what didn’t. I have them used this as a tool for the future.  EOS 3 0 13 That's a good way to look at it.  EOS 3 1 14 [Question] You are making good steps to rethink the situations. Is there anything else contributing to the heat rack you still feel?  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] Heartbreak  EOS 3 0 16 Well I have also not met anyone since and fear that I will not fall in love again.  EOS 3 1 17 [Self-disclosure] That is difficult. I understand how it feels to be lonely. Something I’ve done when I’ve felt that way was to learn to fall in love with myself. I like to do self care and make time for things I might not have time for if I were in a relationship. 
[reference_response]	that is difficult. i understand how it feels to be lonely. something ive done when ive felt that way was to learn to fall in love with myself. i like to do self care and make time for things i might not have time for if i were in a relationship.

EOS 4 0 4 I could use someone to talk to.  EOS 4 1 5 [Others] I would love to listen. Where would you like to start?  EOS 4 0 6 I’ve been feeling down since I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years.  EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I'm so sorry to hear that. Breakups are never an easy thing. I've also gone through those and they can make you feel awful.  EOS 4 0 8 I’m just trying to pick up the pieces and look to be positive.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's an excellent place to start. It's hard but I believe that you can do it.  EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have any family or friends that you've been speaking to about this?  EOS 4 0 11 Thanks for the encouragement. That means a lot.

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hi there!  EOS 4 1 1 [Others] Hello! How are you doing today?  EOS 4 0 2 Oh, not too bad - and you?  EOS 4 1 3 [Others] I'm doing well. How can I help you today?  EOS 4 0 4 I'm just getting frustrated with a cousin of mine. I really appreciate her support through stuff like both my parents dying last year, and I'm trying to support her, too...  EOS 4 0 5 But she'll be set off by completely unpredictable things. I try hard to avoid any possible conflict, but she finds a way to get hurt anyway.  EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand why this would be frustrating for you. Its good that you are trying to support her. Have you talked to her about the way you're feeling?  EOS 4 0 7 We hardly ever talk on the phone, which sometimes would be easier. I just feel like she's so close to losing it all the time, I don't want to seem critical.  EOS 4 1 8 [Question] Do you think she is any sort of danger that someone should know about?  EOS 4 0 9 Only in the sense that she could have a nervous breakdown, or collapse from exhaustion. She's really strong, though.  EOS 4 1 10 [Question] That is understandable. Do you think it's to the point where maybe you should say something to her about it? Even if you might sound a bit critical?  EOS 4 0 11 Well, I have asked her about counseling, and she does have a counselor. Her husband won't do joint counseling. A decade ago, I might have talked to her mom about it, but her mom is now frail herself, and her own husband is a lot to handle. I feel protective of my aunt, too.  EOS 4 0 12 I almost feel like her counselor doesn't do much good for her, but I know there are different styles of therapy... I feel like the therapist just echoes back to her how awful her husband is, etc (he's not really that bad, but they've grown apart). But if I ever say anything like this, she just doesn't speak to me for weeks.  EOS 4 0 13 I know I need to try to approach the topic with her. It would be better in person, but that's not easy now. We live 800 miles apart, too.  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought of any possible solutions you think could possibly work to fix this issue? 
[reference_response]	have you thought of any possible solutions you think could possibly work to fix this issue?

EOS 4 0 4 Lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. They even called my face as flat as a pan! What should I do? I see them everyday on the bus  EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried confronting them and asking why they are being bullies?  EOS 4 0 6 I did and they respond by saying that they are just joking and that I'm handsome. But it's starting to get on my nerves because it's all they make fun about every time they see me!  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure you are very handsome! They could just be jealous.  EOS 4 0 8 Haha I would hope so  EOS 4 0 9 Still though, it makes me want to avoid them when I go to school on the bus  EOS 4 0 10 What do you think I should do then?  EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, school was tough for me too.  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I suggest you tell them to knock it off or you can sit somewhere away from the bus.  EOS 4 0 13 Should I just beat them up with my backpack  EOS 4 1 14 [Information] No, beating them up will only get you in trouble and that won't help.  EOS 4 0 15 There's another bus route. Should I just take that instead  EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that could be a good idea if it's not too far out of your way.  EOS 4 0 17 I think I will. Their comments make me very insecure  EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] You could also tell a teacher what is happening. They will help you out.

[contxt]	5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like it would be quite frustrating for your friend to talk way too much on the phone.  EOS 5 0 5 No, he loves it! I'm the one who hates it.  EOS 5 1 6 [Question] My goodness! How do they respond when you ask to end the conversation?  EOS 5 0 7 I tell him, but he just doesn't get it. Or, he says he understands, but then just goes back to talking!  EOS 5 0 8 Or, he may finally end the talk, but the next time we talk, he will just do it all over again!  EOS 5 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] I wonder what it would be like for him if you hung up the phone even after he said he still wanted to talk.  EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Wow--that does sound annoying that he will repeat the same pattern the next time.  EOS 5 0 11 He will literally talk up to 10 minutes without letting you have a word in. As far as that advice, I have hung up, but he gets extremely offended easily.  EOS 5 1 12 [Self-disclosure] That sounds really difficult if he gets offended so easily. I find it hard to talk to some of those kinds of friends.  EOS 5 0 13 I'm at my wits end. I tell him all the time. "You talk too much. You gotta stop talking at me. You gotta give the other person a turn. You gotta respect other's time."  EOS 5 1 14 [Question] What do you get out of the friendship with this other person?  EOS 5 0 15 Well, I've been friends with him for a long time. He's funny and can have interesting perspectives on things. Also, we have done a lot together in the past.  EOS 5 1 16 [Question] That sounds like a lot that the two of you have been through. Were there other times that your friends was more equally responsive or attuned to you in conversations?  EOS 5 0 17 Oh, yes, I have other friends in conversations who can take turns and understand the concept of time just fine.  EOS 5 0 18 I just don't know what to do about this guy in particular. I still want to be his friend, but he just doesn't change.  EOS 5 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I wonder if there is anything nice you could do for yourself when you are talking to him that would make it easier to talk to him.  EOS 5 0 20 Do you think I should just have a timer that goes off at 1 minute and let it beep in his face if he goes on for too long to train him like a monkey?  EOS 5 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see that you are feeling upset and angry when he talks so much and that is totally understandable.  EOS 5 0 22 I just need a method. Talking to him is just not working.  EOS 5 0 23 He is hard to condition.  EOS 5 1 24 [Information] Would it hurt his feelings to use a timer like that? It may for some other people.  EOS 5 0 25 Yea, but I might be able to slip some humour in there to take the edge off because it is so silly.  EOS 5 1 26 [Information] Humor is really helpful for a lot of people.  EOS 5 0 27 Any other ideas?  EOS 5 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes, people draw or do something else distracting with their hands when talking to someone who dominates the conversation.  EOS 5 0 29 So your option is to start just doing something else when he is talking? He might get the message in a subtle way?  EOS 5 1 30 [Information] Sometimes that is a less offensive way to retrain someone who is being obnoxious or dominant and yet who is easily offended. And, it can help preserve your sense of being grounded. 
[reference_response]	sometimes that is a less offensive way to retrain someone who is being obnoxious or dominant and yet who is easily offended. and, it can help preserve your sense of being grounded.
[hypothesis_response]	i can imagine that would be a very hard time for him. have you tried to talk with him about this issue?

[contxt]	3 0 1 i am stressed to the core.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] What is stressing you out? Maybe I can encourage you.  EOS 3 0 3 i can't maintain a work - life balance. unable to connect socially.  EOS 3 0 4 i feel alone eventhough i am in my home  EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your home work balance, are you working from home?  EOS 3 0 6 yes. i am working remotely from home due to this pandemic.  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand that you would feel lonely. Isolation is not healthy for any of us. It seems to be forced on us. Have you any friends or family you could call on the phone?  EOS 3 0 8 yes.i have. but , its bad that you can't meet them in person or you haven't gone out for a while.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is true, it feels terrible to not go out. We don't listen to the government anymore because we don't know anyone who died, so we still meet with our friends. I would be lost without them, however we don't meet as much so I do make it a point to call them. What will happen if you leave your home?

EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I recently lost my childhood best friend to covid 19.  EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can only imagine how sad you feel from losing your best friend. Hopefully chatting some will help. I know in the past when I lost someone it was nice to just have a conversation to help put my mind at ease.  EOS 0 0 5 Sure.

How can I handle this sleepless nights?  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That's a tough one. I personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons. Some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed. I have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines. The biggest thing is to not use your bedroom for anything but sleeping; so don't read a book or play on your phone in bed, you have to train your body that when you go to bed it is time to sleep.

EOS 3 1 5 [Question] what made you feel this way?  EOS 3 0 6 The pressures of Covid and taking care of my disabled sister are just getting to me.  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i see how that could make you a bit anxious. I get the same way also.  EOS 3 0 8 Thanks. I'm just tired of the Covid restrictions. I can't wait for things to get back to normal.  EOS 3 1 9 [Others] i feel the same. being on lockdown could make anyone a little crazy  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] do you have family or friends that you could reach out to over the phone?  EOS 3 0 11 I do. My other sister is always a big help. Maybe I should text her more often?  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes! that would always be a good idea. its always comforting to hear from a loved one.  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] i myself yearn for a good call from family or even hearing someone close voice. always makes me smile.  EOS 3 0 14 That's true. I tend to stew on my thoughts.  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] hows the weather where you are?  EOS 3 0 16 It's not too bad. Cloudy and 40 which is pretty good for this time of year. How's your weather?  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] i live in the south . not cold yet. but your weather sounds like it would be nice for a lovely walk.  EOS 3 0 18 Exercise does always help. I walk/jog five miles every day. I generally feel my best right after that. Don't you find that true too?  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] yes! although i probably couldnt walk nor run 5 miles a day. i love getting out to enjoy nature. it always helps to keep mind off things. does that usually work for you?

I'm out of work. I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills.  EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] if i get you right, you are fired because of your health condition  EOS 2 0 5 No, I quit because they refused to make an exemption.

[contxt]	0 0 1 Hi!  EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How may I help you today?  EOS 0 0 3 What suggestions do you have for unruly kids who argue when their parent need quiet in their respective offices because we work at home?  EOS 0 0 4 Yelling does not work.  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you tried to talk to your kids about that?  EOS 0 0 6 I'm thinking of taking away devices, but then Corona is still here. I feel that is very mean considering they are already stressed being in doors.  EOS 0 0 7 Talking is great when we are doing it and they all agree. But it never stays this way.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe that will be a good thing because it might make them wished they had listened to you and won't do it again,  EOS 0 0 9 I almost feel like crying.  EOS 0 0 10 I hear you but....  EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Everything will be okay  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Try to talk to them and be very firm with them  EOS 0 0 13 I feel that is abusive when I know how bad they are being affected psychologically. I actually feel like just locking them in their rooms until we get done working. Kind of like being grounded....  EOS 0 0 14 I will try to talk with them again. I know I will probably be tearful which I know bothers them.  EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] How about reward them with something if they listen and behave  EOS 0 0 16 Maybe they will react to that...  EOS 0 0 17 I'm so glad the vaccine is here \  EOS 0 0 18 Thats a better idea....  EOS 0 1 19 [Self-disclosure] Don't get to hard on yourself everything will be okay  EOS 0 0 20 I appreciate your support and maybe I will take them to the park where we all play family games but just with us four. They really love to do that. I think that they want attention from us more because we are right here.  EOS 0 0 21 Or maybe we'll have a picnic together.  EOS 0 0 22 It has been awhile since we have done something outside of the house together.  EOS 0 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] Yes maybe that will work for them and probably want to be outside 
[reference_response]	yes maybe that will work for them and probably want to be outside

[contxt]	3 0 1 okay right now  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything in particular you wanted to discuss?  EOS 3 0 3 i am 66, my immediate family is dead, no kids, in touch only with a cousin who is a very troubled person, sometimes her depression spreads to mine, limited friends, COVID makes conditons more sad  EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] That definitely sounds like a rough situation and I'm sorry to hear about it, though I'm glad you decided to reach out.  EOS 3 0 5 i unloaded a lot on you but current situations do not feel good  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] That's what I'm here for. I want to support you in any way I can, especially given your situation. Did you want to talk just to talk? Or we can discuss a way to work through what you might be dealing with mentally? It also sounds like keeping in touch with your cousin isn't helping in any way, so maybe we can talk about how to handle that? I am entirely at your disposal.  EOS 3 0 7 she is my age, in a homeless women's, very bad living conditions, she is a mental health client but treatment team seem so to feel that as long as they keep her medicated, their job is done. she has a dx of bipolar and probably has borderline personality. her background is similiar to mine, i cannot abandon her as her other family has done.  EOS 3 1 8 [Information] That's definitely difficult and it's easy to see why it wears on you so much. As much as you don't want to abandon her, it's important to remember to take care of yourself too. It's like when you're on a plane and the safety pamphlet tells you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others with theirs. You might not be able to help your cousin as much as you want to if you are suffering too much. Are there any mental health resources you've tried for yourself other than reaching out here?

[contxt]	3 0 1 Bad. Almost had a good day and then got treated bad in the end so I don't know why I try.  EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand how you feel. It seems as if you are being treated badly for no genuine reason. Is this correct?  EOS 3 0 3 That is correct.  EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Who is treating you badly? Do you believe there are any causes behind the actions of those hurting you?  EOS 3 0 5 My husband mainly. He just doesn't want me to enjoy life I guess.  EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] That must be really difficult to go through, I know when my partner treats me badly, I am hurt and upset with them.  EOS 3 0 7 Yeah, just become part of life I guess. Doesn't make it any better.  EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Are there any steps you can think of taking to express your frustrations with your husband?  EOS 3 0 9 I have tried many times. It always ends up my fault in the end so I don't bother anymore and just take it.  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is easy to lose patience when the blame is always directed towards you. I am sorry that is occurring, but applaud you for your efforts in trying to express your frustration. 
[reference_response]	it is easy to lose patience when the blame is always directed towards you. i am sorry that is occurring, but applaud you for your efforts in trying to express your frustration.

EOS 1 1 4 [Question] Can I ask what has happened?  EOS 1 0 5 My sibling broke the tv and blamed it on me and my parents believed them  EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. That must be a hard situation, to not have your folks believe you.  EOS 1 0 7 It is very frustrating  EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Have you spoken with your sibling about why they lied?  EOS 1 0 9 No, we just got into a yelling fight about it and are both in our rooms now  EOS 1 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure it's frustrating when you know you're correct and no one believes you.  EOS 1 0 11 Yes it is  EOS 1 0 12 I'd rather just run away from everything  EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] It's not cool that you're sibling lied, but it may be a good time to breathe a second. Running away never solved anything  EOS 1 0 14 It is late at night  EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] So probably it's quiet. this is a good time to take a breath and , literally try and sleep on it.  EOS 1 1 16 [Question] What do you want to see happen?  EOS 1 0 17 that is probably a good idea. I want my sibling to be punished not me and for parents to believe me  EOS 1 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] OK, I understand.

[contxt]	0 0 6 No. It’s hard to have a good support system and I’m worried about her.  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Does she have anyone else around her who is supporting her?  EOS 0 0 8 She has her husband but limited friends in there area. I want to make sure I am being there and providing correct support.  EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Do you feel that you are not offering as much support as you might?  EOS 0 0 10 Correct.  EOS 0 0 11 She lives in another state. I’m not sure how to properly support her.  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I know how you feel. It can be very difficult to know what to say if someone is seriously ill. Sometimes it's better just to offer quiet support and tell people that you are there to listen if they need you.  EOS 0 0 13 That is good advice. Have you been through something like that?  EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes I have. My sister in law was diagnosed with cervical cancer and I wanted to be supportive but I had no real idea what to say.  EOS 0 0 15 How did you manage to support her. How did you make sure your mental health was also okay?  EOS 0 1 16 [Information] I actually talked to a counsellor about it. I think that you should do that, it might help you a lot.  EOS 0 0 17 I think that is good advice.  EOS 0 0 18 Maybe even a cancer support group? I want to make sure I’m encouraging her.  EOS 0 1 19 [Information] Counselling can be expensive but there are some charities out there that offer a few sessions for free  EOS 0 1 20 [Others] Yes that is an excellent idea and you could both join the same group  EOS 0 0 21 That is a good idea.  EOS 0 0 22 I know with covid it is important to be mindful of cost.  EOS 0 1 23 [Question] How do you feel in yourself at the moment? Are you worried about your own health?  EOS 0 0 24 I’m not worried about my health. More worried and sad about her. Especially not knowing how severe it is yet. It seems like any extra stress this year is harder to handle.  EOS 0 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are certainly not the only one who is feeling this - it has been a terrible year. Cancer is bad at any time but this year it is especially awful.  EOS 0 0 26 I agree. It feels like everything is just a bit harder to get through  EOS 0 1 27 [Others] I am hoping that in the New Year things will be better .. maybe in January the world will look like a more positive place.  EOS 0 0 28 I’m trying to be hopeful to  EOS 0 0 29 That said I think it will take another year or two to get there  EOS 0 1 30 [Others] I hope that things go well with you and your mentor.

[contxt]	0 1 19 [Information] Of course, breathing is the body's most calming function, you dont need a set amount of breaths, but take the time to be aware of the action and the stillness around you  EOS 0 1 20 [Information] It would help more than you think it will  EOS 0 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] In this time that you have, I think it would be nice to take the time you have with your family and enjoy it  EOS 0 0 22 I actually feel the support from my wife for which i am grateful but then my children are young to understand it all. I used to do a lot for them and constantly tell me to do the same but am unable cause it needs money  EOS 0 0 23 It is quite unfortunate that in my family we are used to finding joy as a family outside the home setting which requires spending and this we are not able to meet it often times as we have had to reduce spending  EOS 0 0 24 Apart from deep breaths, what other ways can i use to manage my anxiety?  EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] Spending time actively playing with your kids would help, along with morning exercise (but nothing too strenuous) if you choose to do so  EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] if you enjoy reading, I suggest taking the time to find a book that you used to enjoy and give it another read  EOS 0 1 27 [Others] it will remind you of a time when you were in a good place, and hopefully project that feeling back to you  EOS 0 0 28 Wow, am amazed! You mean anxiety can be managed so simply?  EOS 0 0 29 Wanna give it a try  EOS 0 1 30 [Information] I hope you do, positive attitude is the start to a healthy mind. This may not work for everything and the anxiety won't just disappear on day one or maybe ever, but these are steps you would want to start with :)  EOS 0 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Coping with anxiety is what you make of it, remember to not beat yourself up about things you ultimately cannot control.  EOS 0 0 32 sure. Let me adjust my attitude first and accept the situation.

Please know that I am happy to listen and to help you if I can!  EOS 0 0 3 Thank you for that. I really miss my girlfriend.  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I am sorry to hear that. Have you separated or can you just not be together at Christmas?  EOS 0 0 5 We are separated. She said I was watching too much Buzzr and didn't pay enough attention to her, so she dumped me.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] That is not good. But relationships can be reestablished if you talk. Have you considered seeing a third party to help you both talk this out?  EOS 0 0 7 We tried to see a counselor. It did go too well, the counselor took her side on everything, it was very unprofessional.  EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I seem, so do I hear you saying that you feel that everyone is against you on this and that you feel powerless?  EOS 0 0 9 It feels like that way. Even my parents seem to support her more than me. I am all alone now watching a Buzzr marathon with no one to truly support me.  EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry that your parents are not being more supportive. I understand how hard it is when you have a break up and loved ones seem to support your ex!  EOS 0 0 11 Has this happened to you before?  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Please know that you are not alone in this situation and that there will be light at the end of the tunnel.  EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] Yes it has .. my boyfriend left me for someone else and most of our mutual friends took his side!  EOS 0 0 14 I am sorry to hear that, I think your boyfriend made a big mistake leaving you, you seem like a very nice and sweet person.  EOS 0 1 15 [Question] Thank you :) I am sure that there is someone else out there for you too if you cannot reconcile with your ex. The question is, how much do you really want to? You might be better off without her  EOS 0 0 16 That might be true, she really blew it with me, I am a good catch.  EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a good way to think! Never let something like this destroy your self esteem.  EOS 0 0 18 I agree. You know, you are very good at this. Did you end up finding a new boyfriend or husband?  EOS 0 1 19 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I am engaged now. I realise that my ex did me the biggest favour anyone ever could!  EOS 0 0 20 Well that is a good success story! Thank you for the motivation.

Is this related to the pandemic or is it something separate? I am sure that the pandemic has not helped, though!  EOS 3 0 3 It's definitely related! I lost my dream job, went to a lower paying one, and I gained a lot of weight while working from home.  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Oh I can certainly relate to that one! I've gained a stone and a half in the last year. All this sitting around is not good for us!  EOS 3 0 5 It's definitely nice to know that other people are having similar emotions as me.  EOS 3 1 6 [Others] Sometimes just having someone to talk to who knows how you are feeling can be really helpful I think.  EOS 3 0 7 It's sad that this year has been so awful.

Better financial situation  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Well, the first and third one are out of your control really but you could make a start on the first one today if you liked :)  EOS 3 0 11 It's hard to take the first steps. I don't even know where to begin, sadly.  EOS 3 1 12 [Others] I can understand that. Perhaps you could join an exercise class or similar?  EOS 3 0 13 That's a pretty good idea. Have you ever done something like that?  EOS 3 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I took an aerobics class once. It was quite fun and it was good exercise.  EOS 3 0 15 That does sound like fun. Do you have any other suggestions?  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Well, it's maybe not the best time to be taking on a financial commitment but have you ever considered adopting a dog? Good company and good exercise  EOS 3 0 17 Actually, I have a cat!  EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Ah I have two - they are wonderful company. Alas you can't really walk with them though :)  EOS 3 0 19 They are great company. Sometimes when I am really feeling down, I remember that my cat needs me, so I need to stay strong.  EOS 3 1 20 [Others] Pets are great like that. Do you perhaps have a neighbour whose dog you could walk if you can't get one of your own? 
[reference_response]	pets are great like that. do you perhaps have a neighbour whose dog you could walk if you can't get one of your own?
[hypothesis_response]	i totally understand! i have been in a similar situation with my cat before. she was a very loving and caring cat, she was very loyal and i had to take her with me. i would say that the fact that you have a dog is a great idea.

[contxt]	1 1 9 [Question] Does he often struggle with homework?  EOS 1 0 10 he just didn't like doing things sometimes  EOS 1 0 11 but generally is fine.  EOS 1 1 12 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you feel he has a loss of motivation towards school work, is this correct?  EOS 1 0 13 no, he just didn't want to be told what to do.  EOS 1 0 14 very emotional these days for kids  EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Alright, so you feel he has an issue with following instructions? Have you ever tried disciplinary action like taking away video games when he feels he does not want to listen to you?  EOS 1 0 16 Yes I did. But no point, he just upset on things like didn't get to be with his friends, or having no friends, no life etc.  EOS 1 1 17 [Question] Do you feel he could possibly be depressed?  EOS 1 0 18 I think so  EOS 1 0 19 But so am I .  EOS 1 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It must be even harder during times of the virus!  EOS 1 0 21 Yes  EOS 1 1 22 [Question] I am sorry to hear that, have you thought about seeing a counselor through the internet?  EOS 1 0 23 yes may be i have to reach out for his school counseler  EOS 1 0 24 thanks for listening .  EOS 1 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] I think that is a very nice idea. I also might suggest finding activities that you both could enjoy and spend time together. Maybe finding a show you both could enjoy will open up room for a greater connection!  EOS 1 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It could also help both of you feeling lonely during these hard times!  EOS 1 0 27 Thanks... I need to find some motivation to do so as well...  EOS 1 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have any self-care activities that you enjoy doing? This could help feelings of depression. Even taking some time out of the week to do something you enjoy can help lift up one's mood.  EOS 1 0 29 I don't have much hobbies but I tried to stay active like going to swim, doing yoga, reading books. So I kept myself busy already but more for the sake of getting my mind of things, like people playing video games and watching tv.  EOS 1 1 30 [Question] Well I am glad to hear that you have some activities you enjoy! In relation to your son, how do you feel when he plays video games constantly?  EOS 1 0 31 He usually is ok but now is holiday I let him play more but got even worst!  EOS 1 0 32 As if playing games made him even more depressed  EOS 1 1 33 [Providing Suggestions] Have you ever thought about using the video games as an incentive. For example, if he finishes his homework, he can play for two hours or something?  EOS 1 0 34 Yes he usually only play after he finished all his homework on school days.  EOS 1 0 35 But now school is out I just let him play whenever.  EOS 1 0 36 But it doesn't make him happier  EOS 1 1 37 [Question] It is good to hear that the video games did not get in the way of him completing his work. Do you have any other ideas as to what hobbies makes him happy or interested?  EOS 1 0 38 I don't know whatelse he wanted to do. It is like he didn't really have a preference.  EOS 1 0 39 Thanks for listening.  EOS 1 1 40 [Providing Suggestions] I think starting with the school counselor is a great idea, I feel she will have more of an idea of how your son functions in school and maybe give ideas to helping his mood.

[contxt]	4 0 3 I have a traumatic brain injury that creates a lot of overstimulation in my life. I used to be social and now I can't be in a social setting for too long without feeling exhausted  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Have you tried to talk to your therapist through video chat or is that something they offer?  EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I talk to my therapist every other week  EOS 4 1 6 [Others] That's great that they can offer that, I know it's very difficult to get regular care at the moment with the pandemic.  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Do you have any family or friends close by or something that you can talk to if you feel like you need some extra support?  EOS 4 0 8 I do not have supportive or understanding friends and family  EOS 4 0 9 I have lost a lot of them in the last few years or have created boundaries because when I got into my first car accident, legit someone said "are you not better yet?" and another said "can't you just walk it off?"  EOS 4 0 10 When I got into my second car accident, people said "again? are you drunk?"  EOS 4 0 11 Even though neither were my fault, people were not understanding or asked how scary those situations for me were  EOS 4 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that, people are very quick to judge so it's very unfortunate that you were treated that way.  EOS 4 0 13 After my first car accident, the tow truck guy was towing my car to my aunt's garage to hold for auto insurance appraisal. He said to my aunt "sorry for your loss" My aunt said "oh, she's right over there and alive"  EOS 4 0 14 the car accident was so bad the tow truck guy thought I had died  EOS 4 0 15 but even after seeing my car, friends and family acted like it was just something that happens to everyone. walk it off  EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow, I can't imagine what the car must have looked like then for such a comment to be made. I'm glad that you here and despite going through that trauma that you are still going.  EOS 4 0 17 Thanks.  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] A women fell asleep at the wheel in 2013 and hit me going through an intersection and totaled by car as well, but I had only had a concussion and pain I had to go to physical therapy for a short time, so I can't imagine how you must have felt.  EOS 4 0 19 What are some things you do when you have depression? Have you been in a scary car accident before or know anyone? Have you offered them kindness or you just dismissed them and thought it was their own problem?  EOS 4 0 20 That sounds scary. And is extremely unfortunate.  EOS 4 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma (mental and physical) to begin with and the support is much needed. 
[reference_response]	i'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma mental and physical ) to begin with and the support is much needed.
[hypothesis_response]	i understand, it sounds like it'd be very difficult for you to get involved with that. i would definitely recommend reaching out to a professional to see if there's anything else you could try to help with.

[contxt]	4 0 1 I am feeling really sad and lonely right now. My boyfriend and I broke up and it was me who wanted it but now I regret breaking up and he doesn't want me back.  EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it's too late.  EOS 4 0 3 That is exactly it. I broke up with him because I liked another person but then quickly realized that I made a mistake and it's too late. I want him back should I start calling and going to his house to beg?  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] nobody knows him better than you do, right now I do not think he is in a good place either since it wasn't his choice to end it, how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him?  EOS 4 0 5 I haven't really thought of that yet. He has a pretty short temper actually. I know he is really mad at me so I think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again.  EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response  EOS 4 0 7 Yeah, that's true. I have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and I don't want to let them get to him before I can get him back. I want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together.  EOS 4 1 8 [Question] you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk, so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way, with no yelling or arguing, do you think that's something he would do?  EOS 4 0 9 I can try that, I think he might be responsive at first if I dont set him off. All of his friends hate me so I have nobody on my side right now. Should I try to get his friends to like me again? Is that an way I could use to get him to want me again?  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] nobody likes to see that one's friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back  EOS 4 0 11 I can understand what you mean. I need to think this through.  EOS 4 1 12 [Information] what made you like someone else in the first place?  EOS 4 0 13 Well, we are in a small town and he was popular and the cutest guy in our town. I liked being with someone so popular. He wasn't always nice to me and is why I wanted to be with someone else for a short time. He used to leave me at parties and go off with his friends sometimes.  EOS 4 1 14 [Question] was it a common thing that he didn't give you the attention you wanted? 
[reference_response]	was it a common thing that he didn't give you the attention you wanted?
[hypothesis_response]	have you tried talking to him about how you felt? i know it might be difficult to do, but i think you can do it.

EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I felt much the same way back when I was in college. My parents paid my way through school, and even got me to pursue a major that I had no interest in.  EOS 2 0 13 Yes, that is exactly how I feel  EOS 2 0 14 My parents came from quite a rough background too, and they have sacrificed a lot to get me here  EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can tell you from personal experience and seeing others who've gone through similar events, your parents just may be a little upset right now, but they love you and really just want you to have a good and happy life. It sounds cheesy, I know, but it is actually true.  EOS 2 0 16 Thank you, I hope so :)  EOS 2 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] I know it may sound silly, but you may want to start meditating on a regular basis. It truly does make a big difference in the amount of stress and worrying that you will find yourself not doing nearly so often.  EOS 2 0 18 I've had other people say the same, thank you for the recommendation  EOS 2 0 19 I'll give it a try tonight  EOS 2 1 20 [Information] Studies on the benefits of meditation, mindfulness, and yoga have been pretty definitive in the fact that it drops people's stress levels, and thus their cortisol levels, and makes a real change for the better. I do it myself and it really has worked well for me.  EOS 2 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's great! You'll be so glad that you did, I just know it.  EOS 2 1 22 [Others] Please make sure you get back in touch with me to let me know if it was beneficial for you as well.  EOS 2 1 23 [Question] You might also want to consider having an honest conversation about this with your parents. Are you able to have conversations like that with them?  EOS 2 0 24 I will definitely try and have a conversation with them (after some meditation, of course!)

Why are you worried about your job security? Is something going on with your job that makes you feel this way?  EOS 0 0 3 I am a gig worker paid by the job and recently I have not had as many gigs as normal.  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Understood. Your feelings are definitely valid. Do you have a plan in place for supplementing your work?  EOS 0 0 5 I have put a lot of effort to get to my position. I do not know where to begin in a new position.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Well I'm not sure what type of gig work you do, however, just the fact that you are a gig worker for a long time tells me a few things....1, you are a self starter 2. You have great pritoritizing and time management skills 3. You learn new things easily and with little instruction. All of these things are skill sets that many employers find extremely desirable.  EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps try networking online to find opportunities related to your line of work, either in gig work or for a company. Perhaps even looking for an opportunity as a consultant.  EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I guess these are helpful qualities.

EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I am not too familiar with gig work, but perhaps you know of a site that is similar to Indeed.com but specifically for your line of work or for gigwork .  EOS 0 1 12 [Question] What kind of work do you do?  EOS 0 0 13 Online teaching. I have developed a strong foundation with the company I work for, unfortunately they are actually doing less business at this time  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe you can develop your own courses ? Or, you can also become an online trainer for a variety of organizations.

I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her.  EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites.

EOS 1 1 24 [Self-disclosure] It would affect me as well if I was overlooked and the position was offered to an outsider  EOS 1 1 25 [Question] Is he mean towards others or just you  EOS 1 0 26 Glad to hear I'm not just being petty about it. It's his general nature. His approach is more like a bull in a china shop. His way or no way.  EOS 1 1 27 [Question] Are his tempers basically towards you because you are full time  EOS 1 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There is no reason to be petty. You have a legitimate reasoning to your feelings  EOS 1 0 29 I think may be because my approach to things are a little more subtle. I tend to get a long with people in different departments more than he does. I'm "not aggressive enough" he's said in the past. But I just think it's a different approach on how to handle matters.  EOS 1 1 30 [Question] hate to ask but have the 2 of you been close before  EOS 1 0 31 nothing more than employer/employee.

I just have to find the right way to approach him with my concerns.  EOS 1 1 35 [Reflection of feelings] Being in an environment that seems hostile towards you can make it hard.  EOS 1 0 36 Yeah. Will probably talk to one of my co-workers for more feedback as well.  EOS 1 1 37 [Question] have you address it with HR to see what can be accomplished  EOS 1 0 38 Not yet. But that sounds like a good idea.  EOS 1 1 39 [Affirmation and Reassurance] others might also be noticing and approaching the HR with out your knowledge  EOS 1 0 40 great point. appreciate the feedback.  EOS 1 1 41 [Providing Suggestions] If his actions are noticeable to others maybe you need to address it with a mediator  EOS 1 0 42 great food for thought. I just have to figure out how best to act. thanks.  EOS 1 1 43 [Information] Don't let someone bully you at work. That is borderline sexual harassment.

EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You seem very concerned about this. It seems quite unfair! How do you feel about helping the other engineer?  EOS 1 0 5 I don't mind the work. The manager we have is very biased against us older engineers. He thinks we want to constantly help out the younger guys he hired. THey are mostly unqualified and their work is sub par.  EOS 1 0 6 I'm 41 and the new guys are all about 24.  EOS 1 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how stressful this must feel to you. Sounds like you are a great experienced worker, but they want to use your expertise instead to train the inexperienced worker.  EOS 1 0 8 yes. I have been reluctant to complain to upper management. I have a couple of co-workers who have my level of experience. They have complained and supposedly one of them will be our manager soon. I have thought about looking for a new job. Covid protocol has kept me from making a move though.  EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] I understand that. I think you have a legitimate complaint. Maybe go to upper management and make it more like a concern than a complaint? If you word it right, they will believe that you really care about your job (I can tell that you really do). I am sure they don't want to lose you.  EOS 1 0 10 Thing is in my industry, aerospace interiors, the competition is cut throat in engineering. I already have to work about 55 hours/week.

EOS 0 0 4 I've just received my pink slip at work. I knew it might happen, but was hoping they would choose to keep me on.  EOS 0 0 5 I'm really freaking out here. I have got to find a job before Monday.  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Did they have a reason for giving you the pink slip?  EOS 0 0 7 They are getting rid of all kinds of people and I think the newest hires are going first.  EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You will find a job if you are determined enough :)  EOS 0 0 9 People were let go every Friday for the last month. I was hoping I had another week to try and save up.  EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Do you have enough money to keep going?

[contxt]	3 0 6 Has something similar happened to you before  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long ago was the breakup?  EOS 3 0 8 Many years ago this was not recent at all  EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I had a bad breakup that I thought about for about 6 months. Then I realized that life moves on. If it did not work out, it was for a reason.  EOS 3 0 10 But none of my partners have lived up to her  EOS 3 0 11 How did you come to that realization  EOS 3 0 12 Was it just time or was there something that you actually did  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I thought about the good times and bad. I went over why it didn't work. I realized that it never would have. Then I carried that new knowledge to my next relationship  EOS 3 0 14 Oh that is good advice  EOS 3 0 15 did it work for you or would you suggest that I do something like this  EOS 3 0 16 or something slightly different  EOS 3 1 17 [Others] It was time and meeting new people/partners. I knew after the breakup more about myself and what I needed in a long term/life long partner  EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Have you been dating other people?  EOS 3 0 19 Yes since that time I have dated other people , and many of them have been great people  EOS 3 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] They have been great people? You need to learn/remember what you liked most about the partner that you are talking about, what you didn't like most, and find both a new partner.  EOS 3 0 21 It still keeps lingering in the back of my head about my ex even though I have had other great partners  EOS 3 0 22 Yes this is good advice thank you  EOS 3 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know you will find the rigt person.  EOS 3 0 24 Thank you this is very kind and helpful advice, and it is helpful to know that it comes from experience  EOS 3 1 25 [Self-disclosure] It took my 2 years after my last breakup to find my now wife! Just be patient and keep looking  EOS 3 0 26 Please tell me if there are any other things that I should try that you have not mentioned as well?>  EOS 3 1 27 [Others] Well, you could read a few books about relationships? Do some research  EOS 3 0 28 Are there any particular books or authors that you would recommend  EOS 3 1 29 [Others] Not really, I would just look online, and type in relationship books and look at reviews.  EOS 3 0 30 That is good, I have a friend that only reads these types of books, I could ask him for some suggestions, I don't want to seem like I am being a burdun to him though  EOS 3 0 31 He is a counselor and I am sure that he is frequently asked to help people when he just wants to be a normal friend  EOS 3 1 32 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You think you will burden him? You are not a burden  EOS 3 1 33 [Affirmation and Reassurance] We all have different gifts that my benefit our friends. That is part of being a good friend.  EOS 3 0 34 I just don't want to ever feel like I am being a burden to people,  EOS 3 1 35 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are not. Be confident in yourself  EOS 3 0 36 That is very true that different people have different gifts that they want to share I never thought of it like that  EOS 3 1 37 [Others] Glad I could help  EOS 3 0 38 Have a great day and thank you  EOS 3 1 39 [Others] You as well

EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Can you tell me a little more?  EOS 0 0 5 I wish I could find a job, I have been applying everywhere. I makes me very sad that no one will hire me.  EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] That is definitely understandable. When I first graduated from college, I went through the same thing and thought I would never find a job!  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] What field do you work in?  EOS 0 0 8 This had been such a hard year with covid. I am a pet sitter, but people aren't leaving home so I have no work.  EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Just from this short conversation, I can tell how upset you are. It's definitely hard this year since people aren't traveling.  EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Have you tried any other jobs?  EOS 0 0 11 I have tried every field I might qualify for. People want experience, which I don't have.  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are supplementing income right here with Mturk! That was a great choice!  EOS 0 1 13 [Information] And the vaccine is starting to slowly roll out, I think many more people will feel more comfortable traveling soon,  EOS 0 0 14 Yes, indeed. But I haven't been able to pay rent for 3 months, that is scary.  EOS 0 0 15 I hope so  EOS 0 1 16 [Question] I understand why that is very scary! Do you live alone? Or is there another person bringing in income?  EOS 0 0 17 Just me and my daughter.  EOS 0 1 18 [Information] Many landlords understand the struggle and are allowing tenants extra time when they can't pay. Is that the case for you?  EOS 0 0 19 I don't know, they seem understanding but who knows how much longer? I just hate this unknown.  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] It sounds like the stress of the unknown is really getting to you. I have definitely felt this way over the past year too, You aren't alone.

EOS 5 0 14 I m not sure. why would my friend let it happen, and why would my boyfriend choose to disrespect me in that manner  EOS 5 1 15 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] you've had some time to sit with this, i understand completely that you are disgusted, but how have your felings changed since you found out?

[contxt]	2 0 0 Hi there!  EOS 2 1 1 [Question] hello! what is on your mind today?  EOS 2 0 2 My girlfriend dumped me recently. I'm so lonely. I want another girlfriend, but I'm afraid that I'll never find another one like my last . I don't want to go through the turmoil again.  EOS 2 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] breakups can be really hard!  EOS 2 1 4 [Question] can i ask why she dumped you?  EOS 2 0 5 Yes. And this one has been so hard on me. I've lost my appetite. I have trouble sleeping.  EOS 2 0 6 She said that "we are just not compatible" which sounds like BS. I think she was cheating on me, too.  EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] sounds like you are pretty depressed. that is understandable though  EOS 2 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] if she was cheating she wanst that good of a girl friend. if she said you were not compatible then it sounds to me like she has someone else  EOS 2 0 9 Yeah, but I really liked her a lot. I think that maybe we just needed more time. She didn't know me well enough.  EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] as hard and lonely as it is right now, it was a good thing. yiu seem really great, and you deserve way better than that!  EOS 2 0 11 Thanks! I keep telling myself that, but I'm worried that the same thing will happen with the next girlfriend.  EOS 2 1 12 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] it can be hard letting people in so they can get to know you  EOS 2 1 13 [Question] fear and worry is natural, expecially after being hurt. can you think of anything you could do differnt in a new relationship if you entered one?  EOS 2 0 14 I wonder that too. Did I shut her out? Was she needing more from me?  EOS 2 0 15 Maybe I could be more open? I'm not sure. After this experience, I really don't trust women.  EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] personally, i think dating right now is hard with all the covid crap. its hard to go on dates and do things other than sit in front of a tv. it makes things difficult  EOS 2 1 17 [Question] do you trust your mom?  EOS 2 0 18 Maybe it is better to wait a bit. But I feel like I need to DO something to get better, not just wait around.  EOS 2 0 19 In matters of the heart? No, I don't trust my mom. In matters of the kitchen, yes.  EOS 2 1 20 [Self-disclosure] lol i was adopted. i don't trust my mom. either of them... lol that was a horrible example  EOS 2 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] what i was getting at awas maybe changing your sentance to i dont trust many women  EOS 2 0 22 OH! Ok. I see what you are saying. I should be careful about generalization. That's a good point. One bad experience shouldn't color my view.  EOS 2 1 23 [Question] if you try to get into a new relationship with the mentality that woment cant be trusted.... what re the chances you open up and let the next girl get to know you? 
[reference_response]	if you try to get into a new relationship with the mentality that woment cant be trusted.... what re the chances you open up and let the next girl get to know you?
[hypothesis_response]	i'll be honest, i have had a similar experience. i was in a similar situation, i was dumped by my mother and it wasn't my fault. i thought that was the right choice but i was wrong.

EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] That can be both a relief and stressful, because a break is near, but all the exams and projects are due.  EOS 0 0 5 Yes, I am a little more than halfway done with the semester  EOS 0 0 6 The thing is that I am in a doctoral program, so even though the semester is close to the end, I always need to continue working  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Ahh, I see.

EOS 3 0 12 I feel like I get to help alot of people  EOS 3 0 13 it distracts me from my problems exactly  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure you do!

EOS 3 0 18 Thank you  EOS 3 1 19 [Question] If your job is good for you, what do you think makes you feel depressed then?  EOS 3 0 20 I don't know what I'm going to myself when I'm not working  EOS 3 0 21 I feel hopeless about many things  EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] Exercise? Reading? School? Friends?  EOS 3 1 23 [Information] Hopelessness might be something that you have learned because you have expectations.  EOS 3 1 24 [Question] Do you feel that there has to be some sort of result? Progress? Improvement?  EOS 3 0 25 trying to lose weight, trying to void getting diabetes, having better conversation with boyfriend , convince him to spend more time with me instead of work buddies after work hours, want to finish college, being able to buy a house, improving my credit, convincing my dad and brother to get mental help  EOS 3 1 26 [Question] If you didn't do any of those things ever, how would you feel about yourself?  EOS 3 0 27 having a more active lifestyle , making new friends  EOS 3 0 28 those are things I need to accomplish  EOS 3 1 29 [Question] Now imagine you achieve all of those things, and you do so in spectacular fashion. Would you be happy? Or would you find another reason to feel hopeless?  EOS 3 0 30 I believe those are the things that have been bothering me for a long time  EOS 3 0 31 not being able to accomplish those things makes me feel hopeless  EOS 3 0 32 frustrated  EOS 3 0 33 feel like I'm meaningless to thers  EOS 3 1 34 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's important to remember that you choose what goals to pursue. You decide the criteria for success and failure. You are the final arbiter of your life.  EOS 3 0 35 those are all goals in my life that I need to reach  EOS 3 0 36 I just don't know how most of the time  EOS 3 1 37 [Providing Suggestions] I understand. We all have goals. Goals can be helpful. But ask yourself why you chose those particular goals.  EOS 3 0 38 I feel like I can't get guidance anywhere  EOS 3 0 39 those are goals that when I accomplish them it will make me feel better  EOS 3 1 40 [Providing Suggestions] It sounds like you need someone to tell you what to do, or to give you permission to do what you want to do.  EOS 3 0 41 if I accomplish them it will feel like there was improvement  EOS 3 0 42 probably I've been used to my dad telling me what to do for a long time  EOS 3 0 43 I lack self motivation  EOS 3 1 44 [Others] If you need permission, I hereby grant you permission to pursue what is meaningful to you.

[contxt]	2 0 4 Oh, hi! Thank you.  EOS 2 0 5 I was just talking to myself. lol No one showed up the last few times I tried to do this.  EOS 2 1 6 [Question] How can I help support you today?  EOS 2 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I know these are tough times and we all need to be heard.  EOS 2 0 8 I'm just looking for someone new to talk to. I don't really feel like I can express my actual feelings in my current living arrangement.  EOS 2 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I have had to stay by myself for most of the year due to the pandemic. That has been hard.  EOS 2 0 10 I've heard the pandemic has affected a lot of people. I'm always alone anyway...or with my roommate,so I haven't noticed much of a difference.  EOS 2 0 11 It's difficult when we have absolutely nothing in common.  EOS 2 1 12 [Others] Have you tried different games that help you get to know each other? Maybe try a movie or series. I loved Sweet Magnolia's on Netflix.  EOS 2 0 13 I'm mainly worried that she'll throw me out of the house and I'll have no where to live.  EOS 2 0 14 Oh god forbid we watch a movie. She's too obsessed with CNN to watch anything else.  EOS 2 0 15 She's become brainwashed by the tabloid media...  EOS 2 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Oh my goodness. The good thing is there is a moratorium on evictions so she would not be able to do that legally. CNN can be overwhelming. Try giving her some type of distraction. Suggest yoga or some type of bonding.  EOS 2 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] I think 24/7 news is problematic but here to stay.  EOS 2 0 18 I actually do yoga every evening. She hates it. I'm living in her home without a lease, so I wonder if she can just tell me to leave.  EOS 2 0 19 I can't imagine why anyone would want to watch the news for more than to just catch up (If you like lies and nonsense)  EOS 2 1 20 [Information] As long as you have property there she would have to formally evict you. That is the good news.  EOS 2 0 21 That is good news. Thanks for letting me know that.  EOS 2 1 22 [Others] I think it is best to stick with a short local news report.  EOS 2 1 23 [Information] My pleasure. So many people are worried about losing their place to stay but thankfully most are protected due to the pandemic.  EOS 2 0 24 I just found mturk. I just started here. Any advice as to what to do? I've mainly just been doing surveys. I'm not good at the small tasks.  EOS 2 1 25 [Information] Check Youtube videos on using Panda's. It will help you make more money. I have done over 750,000 hits.  EOS 2 0 26 Oh wow, that's amazing! I've done this particular hit 3 times...I've only found a person once though. I will definitely check out the videos. thank you!  EOS 2 0 27 What are pandas? Or is it too hard to explain?  EOS 2 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] You are welcome. Panda's help you keep grabbing hits. You can store 25 at a time.  EOS 2 0 29 Oh, I see. Great! Thanks so much for chatting with me and for the advice.  EOS 2 0 30 It's been nice to have someone new to vent to. :)  EOS 2 1 31 [Reflection of feelings] Have a great night and take care of yourself. It has been a pleasure.

EOS 4 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are having trouble with Virtual school being so hard and it's causing you stress, am I understanding correctly?  EOS 4 0 6 Yes, that is correct.

EOS 4 0 11 I wish I knew how long we would have to be virtual. I don't think I can last another semester teaching myself from home.

Just chatting with you, I can feel how stressed and anxious about it you are!  EOS 4 0 13 Yes, I was always an honors student so this is a huge change for me. I'm afraid it will reflect on my GPA forever.

EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Are you having to move home or were you taking online classes?  EOS 3 0 5 i am staying with my parents.  EOS 3 0 6 i am thinking of applying an online job but i am afraid that i can't manage both my studies and job  EOS 3 0 7 thinking about it makes me frustrating and sad  EOS 3 1 8 [Question] That is understandable. So you aren't having to discontinue your studies immediately?  EOS 3 0 9 i have discontinued it already  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Okay, thank you for clarifying :-) Your frustration is understandable. Having a job while being in school can be tough, that is true. However if you are discerning you could get a job that would have flexible hours, especially if you let them know beforehand that you're planning on getting back into school as soon as possible.  EOS 3 0 11 yes. thank you for concern  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] When I was in college, I worked for the school and the library.

[contxt]	3 0 2 I've been feeling very depressed recently. I've been doing very bad in this class and that is just not like me.  EOS 3 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, so you are usually a pretty decent student? I'm sorry to here that you are experiencing this  EOS 3 0 4 I was up until this pandemic started. I feel like this shift to online learning has really taken it's toll on me and my learning.  EOS 3 0 5 I've tried reaching out to my professors and doing virtual group study sessions with my class mates, but for some reason, things just don't seem to stick that well.  EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You know, a lot of students are really struggling with this new learning style, so it's very understandable  EOS 3 0 7 Really? I feel like everyone around me is doing fine and that makes me feel that there is something wrong with me.  EOS 3 0 8 Maybe I'm just slow?  EOS 3 1 9 [Information] Most people where masks of content, so you never know how much they are struggling. It's not always beneficial to compare yourself to others  EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Are you having issues with focusing?  EOS 3 0 11 I think so? I think it is just the way the material is taught now. We have these "Zoom" sessions where everything is taught online, but it just all feels so impersonal. We are expected to read things on our own and then come to class ready to do these activities. I just prefer the old style of attending classes, having someone teach me the material, and then going back and studying on my own.  EOS 3 0 12 I think it is also the social aspect of this pandemic too. I haven't seen my firends in person in a very long time.  EOS 3 0 13 I'm worried that if my poor performance continues, then I might loose my scholarship.  EOS 3 1 14 [Question] What happened when you reached out to the teacher?  EOS 3 0 15 He just gave me some additional books to read, but I did not find that helpful. I really do well when I have someone teach the material to me, not just tell me to read on my own.  EOS 3 0 16 But maybe I'm not able to do well because I'm stupid. I know I should be able to understand things on my own, but I just can't seem to do that.  EOS 3 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] I think if you could teach yourself, the class wouldn't exist.  EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Does your class have a study group?  EOS 3 1 19 [Information] Usually schools offer free tutoring, because students volunteer to do it for credits toward a teaching degree. have you heard of that?  EOS 3 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] There is always a way. You have to be smart to get a scholarship. You deserve to be in that class as much as anyone else  EOS 3 0 21 I have tried the group study sessions, but I feel like I don't retain as much. I just get very discouraged when I see how smart everyone else in my class is.  EOS 3 0 22 I don't know if my school offers free tutoring now. They used to, but I am not sure if they are still offering it due to the pandemic.  EOS 3 0 23 I'll try that though. It might help to get one on one attention from a past student who did well.  EOS 3 1 24 [Information] Well, they most likely do it over zoom. But it's better because it's one on one 
[reference_response]	well, they most likely do it over zoom. but it's better because it's one on one
[hypothesis_response]	i think that it would be great if you had some kind of tutor.

I just prefer the old style of attending classes, having someone teach me the material, and then going back and studying on my own.  EOS 3 0 12 I think it is also the social aspect of this pandemic too. I haven't seen my firends in person in a very long time.  EOS 3 0 13 I'm worried that if my poor performance continues, then I might loose my scholarship.  EOS 3 1 14 [Question] What happened when you reached out to the teacher?  EOS 3 0 15 He just gave me some additional books to read, but I did not find that helpful. I really do well when I have someone teach the material to me, not just tell me to read on my own.  EOS 3 0 16 But maybe I'm not able to do well because I'm stupid. I know I should be able to understand things on my own, but I just can't seem to do that.  EOS 3 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] I think if you could teach yourself, the class wouldn't exist.  EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Does your class have a study group? 
[reference_response]	does your class have a study group?
[hypothesis_response]	i see. i can understand that. it would be nice to have a class teacher that could help you understand yourself better, but sometimes you need someone to talk to about it.

She said mean and nasty things about me, which I don' t care about. But she did the wrong mistake of bringing my child into the equation, when he had nothing to do with it. I wanted to really beat the crap out of her because not only did she do that, she blocked my number and ran. Like I was beyond pissed.

EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid.  EOS 0 0 5 plus my hours were cut at work.  EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut.  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time?  EOS 0 0 8 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes.  EOS 0 0 9 I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it's not the same as face to face.  EOS 0 0 11 Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then. Its not like it use to be.  EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don't feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That's still a win.  EOS 0 0 13 We used to be able to go out and have a few beers together.  EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's good. Keep that connection. It's not going to be the same due to the circumstances. But at least you are seeking to keep that connection, and that is a good thing.  EOS 0 0 15 I hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm.  EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it's not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest.  EOS 0 0 17 Good idea..  EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But I am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work.  EOS 0 0 19 I like to do home repairs. Maybe I can find a group for that.  EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway.  EOS 0 0 21 Do you use any other social media for connecting with new people.  EOS 0 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I use Facebook, Instagram, and sometimes TikTok  EOS 0 1 23 [Self-disclosure] You should do mini videos on easy things to DIY on TikTok.  EOS 0 0 24 True.

EOS 0 0 26 I saw a few TikTok videos but never post a video. Is it hard to post on there?  EOS 0 1 27 [Self-disclosure] not really. what i do is record the video beforehand, and then upload it.

I know this might sound weird but what helped me through it was to actually own it. Take control of it before they can.  EOS 6 0 6 Do you think it would be helpful to use humor? I don't want them to tease me about it but I don't know how else to approach it  EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Yea that is definitely one way to control it  EOS 6 0 8 Lol maybe some of my friends will share with the group too  EOS 6 0 9 that would definitely make me feel better about it  EOS 6 1 10 [Others] Ha, well that could get interesting  EOS 6 0 11 yes, for sure  EOS 6 0 12 anyway, thanks for the chat. this was helpful  EOS 6 0 13 do you think we have made enough conversation for the full bonus?  EOS 6 1 14 [Others] Not yet to be honest  EOS 6 0 15 ah ok, well then i guess we should keep this going  EOS 6 1 16 [Others] I think we have to have 10 rounds of talking?

[contxt]	1 0 3 My coworker expects me to do things the way she does and is constantly critical. I just want her to understand that I am able to do things my way and it is still okay. I told her this and she ignored me.  EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure that's terribly frustrating having someone treat you like that. Is this something that your boss is aware of?  EOS 1 0 5 I have not told her yet. I do not want to get her into trouble and I want to have a good relationship with her.  EOS 1 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Can you discuss it with her in a respectful way to get her to understand that you're not trying to undermine her but that this is how you work most efficiently? And maybe mention that you don't want to involve the boss?  EOS 1 0 7 That's something I could try. I really care about my coworker and it makes me so angry that she treats me this way.  EOS 1 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I think sometimes it's easy to jump to anger when you feel hurt. It might be worth telling her how you feel and also maybe ask why she thinks you should be doing things her way. Maybe there's a give and take in this situation. Some of her methods could be beneficial.  EOS 1 0 9 Do you have any advice on how to start my conversation with her? I have found some of her ideas to be beneficial. I just would like my ideas expressed as well. I feel we can learn from each other.  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Tell her the things that you like about her method and maybe suggest some of your methods to her as well. Maybe she'll find them to be more efficient. Make it a partnership rather than a fight for whose method is better.  EOS 1 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] She could feel threatened by you so it's worth digging into those feelings with her and proving to her that you're working toward the same goal.  EOS 1 0 12 That's a great idea. It is possible. I am the new kid on the block. I will try by being non confrontational. Any specific ideas to how I can do that? She gets offended easily. I want her to know I am helping.  EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] I'd suggest how much she's helped you since you are in fact the new kid on the block. And tell her that you want to work with her to have the most efficient partnership possible and use each of your talents to the best of your ability. Then you can lay out how you work best and see where it goes from there.  EOS 1 0 14 Thanks! I will try that. You made me feel so much better!  EOS 1 1 15 [Others] I'm so glad, these can be frustrating situations but sometimes it's worth looking at the other person's perspective.  EOS 1 0 16 I agree. Sometimes you just have to take a step back and have a conversation with someone not in the thick of it.  EOS 1 1 17 [Information] Absolutely, I have no emotional stake in this. The two of you do and that can cloud things sometimes.  EOS 1 0 18 I think people get territorial when they have worked somewhere and a new person comes in. I see that now. I am optimistic we will work it out and be a great team!  EOS 1 1 19 [Others] That's great to hear, I'm glad we were able to chat! 
[reference_response]	that's great to hear, i'm glad we were able to chat!
[hypothesis_response]	i think that'll be a good start. i've had some friends that were like that too.

[contxt]	0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] The key, however, is our mindset and how we approach the problem. If you are afraid about going our during peak hours, you can step outside during non-peak hours. This is just an example. Everybody's situations and preferences vary.  EOS 0 1 12 [Information] I am frustrated, but I cannot cultivate inaction. Because I have mouths to feed. So I have developed a mindset to tackle the problem by taking all the precautions I possible can.  EOS 0 0 13 so you mean maybe leave the house when it's really quiet to begin with? then slowly build on that over time. isn't this called exposure therapy. I think I have read about this  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] In essence, I know the factors under my control, and I try to control them and work them in my favour. I make it a point not to worry too much about factors outside my control.  EOS 0 0 15 I suppose it makes no sense to worry about things you can't control. I think from my perspective that's exactly the problem, not having control. I don't know why this has affected me so much?  EOS 0 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] Because it's a new situation to most of the world's population! People take time to adjust.  EOS 0 1 17 [Information] You take care of factors under your control - wearing a mask , social distancing when outside and washing/sanitizing hands whenever you can.  EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Try not to pay too much attention to factors OUTSIDE your control - how many people are there and if social distancing is followed to the letter by OTHERS  EOS 0 0 19 yes I know about all the guidance and it would help to follow this. I see my friends dealing with it just fine. I wonder what is making it so hard for me? perhaps I'm overthinking it and just worrying about it excessively.  EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Ya, that might be the root cause. Talk with your partner and try going out when you and them feel it is safe to do so. Start cautiously, then slowly return to your "normal" outdoor times.  EOS 0 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] It can be intimidating at first, but if you don't try, you may never be able to overcome the anxiety or fear.  EOS 0 0 22 yeah I think I really need to give that go. if that doesn't work maybe there are some support groups out there?  EOS 0 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure there are, but make sure those groups are social distancing as well. We are all in this together and we can definitely overcome it :)  EOS 0 0 24 So true! also I think I need to stop watching the news and obsessing about this  EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] Yes. You can distract yourself with music or comedy shows. Or a long lost hobby. After all, one good thing about COVID is, it has put more time on our plates.  EOS 0 0 26 the one thing I do have is time.

Sometimes that can happen when you look back on yourself.  EOS 1 1 4 [Question] What is making you angry about the past?  EOS 1 0 5 I am angry I trusted my ex partner. They cheated on me and tried to hide it for months.  EOS 1 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I can personally relate to that myself. I have went through something similar like that 4 years ago. It can be very frustrating when it happens.  EOS 1 0 7 What do you do when you are reminded of that situation or think about the person?  EOS 1 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] The easiest thing that I did in my situation was obtained a new hobby. I took my anger out on my ex by joining Crossfit and interacted with that community.

EOS 0 1 9 [Information] I suggest that you talk to a counsellor. There should be free services available at your university.  EOS 0 0 10 What kind of advise should I be seeking from the counsellor?  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] Well, perhaps they can at least alleviate your anxiety somewhat.

EOS 0 1 13 [Others] No, as long as you have a doctor's letter explaining why.  EOS 0 0 14 But I am not sick, would the counsellor write note for me under this situation?  EOS 0 1 15 [Others] There is more than one way to be sick. You sound as though you are suffering from depression and stress.  EOS 0 0 16 I guess you are right... I will try to make an appointment with the counselor next week.  EOS 0 1 17 [Question] Do you have any friends or family that you can discuss this with?

We've been together for 4 years. All of their stuff is in the same house we are living in  EOS 3 0 8 Should I kick them out???  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am truly sorry you had to witness that. Would you feel more comfortable with them leaving or do you think either relationship is salvagable?  EOS 3 0 10 That's my current problem. I do still love them but... what would happen if I stay and we work on our relationship?  EOS 3 0 11 Do you think it would be a good idea to solve the relationship and stay?  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] If you feel that something might be salvageable it might be worth looking into. Do you think they'd be open to sitting down and talking it out?  EOS 3 0 13 They did end up crying and saying that it was a mistake. I don't know if it would be a good idea. I think I would have feelings of regret  EOS 3 0 14 The trust wouldn't be there anymore.  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] I think that either way you choose to proceed there is always the choice of remaining amicable. You're all adults, so sitting down and discussing what comes next is an inevitability. Maybe they will choose to leave, or you'll decide it would be better for you to go, but at least the discussion would be ongoing to perhaps resume the friendship at a later time?

EOS 2 0 2 I'm doing alright, I'm facing a lot of academic pressure from my program and I feel trapped  EOS 2 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, it sounds like you are stressed from the academic pressure that you are facing right now?  EOS 2 0 4 Yes, I have a lot of coursework but I have no help from from my advisors. A few of my peers feel the same way. Not sure what to do. I don't believe remote learning is helpful in a master program because the professor/advisor are not always available.  EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see how this can be stressful for you and your fellow peers. Have you tried other steps besides the one's you tried before by contacting the professor?  EOS 2 0 6 I tried, but the coursework is difficult and the other solution is tutorials on youtube but there is so much you can do on your own. Plus I have a job as well, so limited hours  EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I can relate to this because it is hard to work and do school as well. I can tell it makes you feel concerned about your schooling and you want to do the best you can.  EOS 2 0 8 I wish so, do your best and hope for the best I guess.  EOS 2 1 9 [Others] You are doing great I believe and really trying hard to do your schoolwork right.

EOS 2 0 12 I feel that the stress is effecting my sleep and my work, because I constantly worry. Any tips?  EOS 2 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I would try to have a regular to set a goal for each day by stating to yourself today is a new day, remain focus on the task at hand, try not to worry about all tasks at once, and lastly try to find a relaxing sleep schedule that fits your needs.  EOS 2 0 14 I see, I think making a schedule and breaking task into little ones will help complete them. I guess I will stress less.  EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, It will be hard at first because you are not use to it, but once you get started your life will be so much more relaxing. Your stress level will become more less than what is was before. Also, You will be able to have a clearer mind to concentrate on your schoolwork more by having this new schedule.

[contxt]	3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Yes, job applications can feel particularly demeaning to complete. Personally, I get frustrated with all the repetition and then repetitive rejection. It seems like I had no value.  EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But you have to consider that there are dozens of different reasons why you don't get selected for a job, and quite a few of them have nothing to do with you , either as a person or as an employee.  EOS 3 0 6 It feels good someone else knows how frustrating and what a cycle it creates but I am also sorry that you do know how it is also.  EOS 3 0 7 Thank you for that, it seems most of the jobs I am applying for I am over qualified for which doesn't make sense to me and makes me think it is something personal about me.  EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] No, don't think that. I know of several employers that have actually said they don't want employees smarter than them. It requires more money and more management, and quite a few people are very happy to not do either of those things for ostensibly higher quality workforce.  EOS 3 1 9 [Question] On an actionable level, have you been getting blocked at the application point or the interviewing point?  EOS 3 0 10 Hopefully I find an employer that sees a quality workforce over other things, its getting pretty discouraging  EOS 3 0 11 I seem to be getting blocked at application level for employment, it seems my skills are mostly being put out to contract work now, which is not something I am familiar with.  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I see. Maybe there are some qualification programs in your local area, or maybe at the local university or college where you could take classes? There is a career development center at my local university that is open to everyone, maybe you could see if they would review your resume and give you some objective feedback? Students love a good live subject :-)  EOS 3 0 13 Wow I have never thought about that! That sounds awesome and like it would be great help, also trying something new would feel nice instead of filing the same stuff into applications!  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] You should explore what resources your city/county/province may offer for job seekers. It is in the best interest of almost every community that its members have have jobs and feel useful, so you may find some valuable information and maybe some connections.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Oh! And what I always tell everyone who is looking for a job: Apply UP! Don't ever think is something above your level. Apply UP! They may admire your temerity and invite you for an interview just to see who you think you are :-)  EOS 3 0 16 My spirits are going up just having this conversation and looking forward to the community outreach. Hopefully it helps lift this gloom that has been over me for months. I loved my previous job but due to bad management it was taking a toll on everyone employed.  EOS 3 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] I am glad to hear you are feeling a little better! Yes, bad management is so toxic. Even with great coworkers in a job you love, horrible management can ruin it quickly.  EOS 3 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You seem like you are open to trying new solutions and putting in the effort to up your competitive level. Stay positive and take care of yourself mentally and physically, and I think you will be successful. 
[reference_response]	you seem like you are open to trying new solutions and putting in the effort to up your competitive level. stay positive and take care of yourself mentally and physically, and i think you will be successful.
[hypothesis_response]	i am sure that the lack of good management has been a big part of your success. i can imagine that your coworker is feeling like this, and you are not even close to them. i wish you all the best!

[contxt]	4 1 2 [Question] I am feeling a bit the same. Is there something specific that you'd like to talk about?  EOS 4 0 3 Well, I moved to a new state - feeling pretty alone.  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Do you not know anyone else there?  EOS 4 0 5 No, not really. I inherited some money, because both of my parents died last year. So I bought a house I love, in a tiny town...  EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Do you think it would benefit you to join some groups or societies where you would meet new people?  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If you feel a little out of your depth, that is perfectly normal at this stage!  EOS 4 0 8 Yes, probably. But of course it's a weird time for that, with COVID...  EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes of course. So you feel that you cannot meet new people due to the pandemic?  EOS 4 0 10 Well, I didn't really do that much before COVID. But everything's changed in my life. I thought I could make a new start.  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that this is a bad time to be making a new start but please believe me, I think that things will get better  EOS 4 0 12 I feel like I know what the right things to do are, but nothing sounds fun. I feel like I'm just trying to force myself to do the things I should want to do.  EOS 4 1 13 [Information] It sounds to me like you might be suffering from depression. A lot of the population have this problem! Do you think that this might be the case?  EOS 4 0 14 It's not that I thought money would buy me happiness, but it is strange that now that I could do almost anything, I really can't think of anything I want to do.  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] That definitely sounds like depression to me. Can I suggest that you talk to your doctor?  EOS 4 0 16 I definitely have depression. I can try taking meds again, I should probalby try counseling... I did start going to a doctor, at least  EOS 4 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] So you have insight into your condition at least ... that is a very positive thing!  EOS 4 0 18 I know it makes sense to try that, since it does help some people. But I just feel like, I know what they're going to say. I already know what I should do. I just don't do it.  EOS 4 1 19 [Question] What is it that you feel that you should be doing? Please do not put too much pressure on yourself!  EOS 4 0 20 It's like I'm just so lazy... I don't do anything. I could honestly just stay in bed and read and sleep all day and night.  EOS 4 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I understand how that feels. I often feel the same way myself, especially now (and at this time of year). Please do not feel bad about it.  EOS 4 0 22 I'm not suicidal at all, but I would be totally fine with a big meteor taking us all out tomorrow. I feel like I gave it a shot, I'm sort of ready to be done. I find myself feeling jealous of very old people...  EOS 4 1 23 [Self-disclosure] I have sometimes felt this way too. Do you have a pet? I have two cats and they do help to cheer me up when I feel especially bad 
[reference_response]	i have sometimes felt this way too. do you have a pet? i have two cats and they do help to cheer me up when i feel especially bad
[hypothesis_response]	i've been depressed too, but that doesn't mean i'd feel any differently about you.

[contxt]	3 0 1 i'm struggling with my depression, I can't seem to get a handle on it  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I'm really sorry to hear that. What kinds of things have you been doing so far to manage your downswing?  EOS 3 0 3 I just keep reliving that moment in my head  EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Lots of obsessive, intrusive thoughts?  EOS 3 0 5 yes, they just keep popping up can't stop it  EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] When I get stuck in that loop, I try to change up my entire physical situation -- take a shower or a soak, change up my music if I'm listening to it. Kind of force my brain to take in a change.  EOS 3 0 7 I tried, I tried to keep myself busy, but boom my depressions hits me like a brick wall.  EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Have you ever explored medication? I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost two years ago, and medication has made an enormous difference for me.  EOS 3 0 9 no my doctor prescribed me meds but it's not working. I will try meditation see it works. any more ideas?  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] You should definitely see if the doctor can adjust your meds, I have ended up on a completely different type of medication than the one I tried first. But I understand. I think you should try getting out of the house and enjoying fresh air and physical activity. It won't cure your depression but it may help your headspace and your point of view.  EOS 3 0 11 hate taking meds. just keep reliving that moment. can't get it out of my head. it's killing  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Have you written it down? Like physically written it down? Sometimes when I have the obsessive thoughts, I'll do that and being able to see it "in real life" satisfies my brain.  EOS 3 1 13 [Information] But if you're reliving a traumatic moment, it may be beneficial to seek out a licensed therapist who can help you process and move past the moment.  EOS 3 0 14 I will take your advice and right down my thoughts , maybe it will help the pain  EOS 3 0 15 I have, I've been seeing a therapist. his not much help I think but it's someone I can talk too  EOS 3 1 16 [Others] I hope it helps you out, you don't deserve to feel constant pain.

EOS 0 0 2 It showed up in her eyes. Right now they aren’t sure what stage until she gets more details.  EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You must be feeling very distressed about it right now. I am happy to talk about it.  EOS 0 0 4 Yes. She is trying to be strong and only told about 4 people. I am trying to be strong for her but it is hard not seeing someone in person right now.  EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know that this is a very difficult time for everyone, given the current situation with Coronavirus. It can't make things any easier for her.  EOS 0 0 6 No. It’s hard to have a good support system and I’m worried about her.  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Does she have anyone else around her who is supporting her?  EOS 0 0 8 She has her husband but limited friends in there area. I want to make sure I am being there and providing correct support.  EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Do you feel that you are not offering as much support as you might?  EOS 0 0 10 Correct.  EOS 0 0 11 She lives in another state. I’m not sure how to properly support her.  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I know how you feel. It can be very difficult to know what to say if someone is seriously ill. Sometimes it's better just to offer quiet support and tell people that you are there to listen if they need you.  EOS 0 0 13 That is good advice. Have you been through something like that?  EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes I have. My sister in law was diagnosed with cervical cancer and I wanted to be supportive but I had no real idea what to say.  EOS 0 0 15 How did you manage to support her. How did you make sure your mental health was also okay?  EOS 0 1 16 [Information] I actually talked to a counsellor about it. I think that you should do that, it might help you a lot.  EOS 0 0 17 I think that is good advice.  EOS 0 0 18 Maybe even a cancer support group? I want to make sure I’m encouraging her.  EOS 0 1 19 [Information] Counselling can be expensive but there are some charities out there that offer a few sessions for free

EOS 3 0 5 she cheated me by having another relationship with her cousin  EOS 3 0 6 it feels so hurting  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have been there myself with a cheating spouse, I know it is rough, especially so close to when it happened. I can assure you it does get better though.  EOS 3 0 8 i can't bear her activity and when i asked about it she lies at me  EOS 3 0 9 and afterwards showing rude attitude towards me  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I think the best thing you can do right now is distance yourself from her.  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] It sounds like she is acting toxic and you do not need that right now. I am happy to help and talk with you, but might i suggest going to a local therapist or counselor?  EOS 3 0 12 yeah, i think so. but i can't control my sadness of being betrayed by my loved one  EOS 3 1 13 [Information] It will take time, the best way to let it not control you is by talking about it. You gain control over it that way.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Being betrayed by someone you love is one of the biggest heart breaks there is. You have to focus on yourself and healing that wound.  EOS 3 0 15 but how can i get out of it, it does so hurting. we are in a relationship of almost 4 years  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] It will not be a quick process that i can heal right now. The best way to get out of it is to see a professional. There are many out there that work on a sliding scale or even free. They will help guide you back to yourself.  EOS 3 0 17 I think so, do i need to concentrate on the activities like achieve my goal  EOS 3 1 18 [Information] Yes do you have any specific goals right now? or even hobbies you are working on?

EOS 3 0 3 yes up to five years but my company getting too much lost so they took out lots of employs  EOS 3 1 4 [Others] I can understand that being used to a routine and then suddenly losing that can cause a lot of depression and confusing for you.

I had worked for the same company for 10 years and they laid me off. I was blindsided and very upset and felt depressed also. I started looking for jobs and found a better one that paid more, so it worked out for the best in the end.  EOS 3 0 9 what you think if apply for new job , i will come out from this depression?

Do you have any family that can be supportive to you through this difficult time?  EOS 3 0 11 Thanks for support  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] You're welcome.

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hello  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing?  EOS 0 0 2 I have been better. I am really stressed and feel like I am at a breaking point.  EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear you are near your breaking point, do you have any idea when the decline and stress began?  EOS 0 0 4 It began a few weeks ago. I have had a really intense project that is on a time crunch. I feel like I am overwhelmed and unable to balance work and personal life.  EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Work and personal life are very hard to juggle with each other, especially in the current life situations around the globe. I am sure you will successfully handle both in the overall.  EOS 0 0 6 What should I do to help feel like I can manage and push through? Right no w i feel like giving up.  EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] For me, when I start getting overwhelmed and need to "debrief" my mind, and "declutter" the stresses, I use a notepad. I jot down every detail I can that pops into mind. Every upcoming task, everything that has caused anxiety or similar, and then I prioritize them in an agenda. It seems tedious, however once you get a handle on scheduling, in my personal ex perience, it is easier to hold yourself accountable and slowly work your way through accomplishments, even small tasks, which is encouraging to continue.  EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Sometimes, something as small as an accomplished task can uplift a mood greatly. Especially when listed and checked off to see the progress. 
[reference_response]	sometimes, something as small as an accomplished task can uplift a mood greatly. especially when listed and checked off to see the progress.

[contxt]	7 0 0 Hi :)  EOS 7 1 1 [Question] Hiya! =) How are you doing, today?  EOS 7 0 2 I'm feeling really stressed about university, to be honest.  EOS 7 0 3 I'm really struggling to find motivation to complete my assignments  EOS 7 0 4 And it's stressing me out how little work I've completed even though deadlines are coming up.  EOS 7 1 5 [Question] I totally understand that. Which year are you in?  EOS 7 0 6 I'm in my final year, having to juggle my dissertation with what feels like a million other assignments  EOS 7 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh goodness, I can't imagine how stressful that would be. I've only gotten my associates, and I found that last semester to be a slough. But what kept me going was the relief and joy I would feel once I had that diploma in hand.  EOS 7 1 8 [Others] Are there any study groups or classmates you can get together with, and basically make a night of it?  EOS 7 0 9 I don't really have any friends on the course, I'm pretty shy and don't really feel comfortable talking to anyone. I kinda promised myself to make more friends in my final year, but obviously circumstances have changed :/  EOS 7 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Very true, this year made everyone's expectations and plans go out the window lol  EOS 7 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] It might be time to put yourself out of your comfort zone, but start small. Are there any clubs or groups associated with your major? That way, you have some common ground to work with.  EOS 7 0 12 I'm honestly not sure, I guess I've always been too nervous to reach out to anyone. I'll have to have a look.  EOS 7 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] That sounds like a good idea =) Even if you can't hold club meetings on campus or have any gatherings, maybe they hold their meetings over video calls. One plus side to that, is that you don't need to have your camera on to participate.  EOS 7 0 14 That's true.

The quarantine has added a lot of anxiety on my end, and I have a hard time coping with the new normal  EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you are feeling. This pandemic got everyone stressed and their anxiety is at an all time high  EOS 1 0 5 yeah I agree with the sentiment. I like my housemates/friends if we hang out once in a while, or run into each other in the common area a few times a week. Now we are all confined under the same roof all the time  EOS 1 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] This pandemic will not last forever and everything will be okay soon  EOS 1 0 7 If someone doesn't remember to wash dishes, or started smoking that resulted in the whole house smelling.

EOS 1 0 12 I don't feel the option of escaping, changing the scenery a little bit or adjusting emotionally  EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] you are doing the right thing by staying in the house but have you just went out side and took a walk to make you feel a little better

EOS 1 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] What ways could you find some support groups for your friend regarding his issues?  EOS 1 0 11 I mean, I have sort of said it before in a really joking way. But now i'm worried it may be a problem  EOS 1 0 12 I feel like if he wants help he should find it himself  EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] It might be worthwhile to recommend him look into getting some counseling about his issues that you seem to think are a real issue.  EOS 1 0 14 he has completely isolated me from ppl i care about  EOS 1 1 15 [Question] How long has this isolating been occurring?  EOS 1 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know that your friend has a lot of issues to address, but you can give him an impetus to look at changing for the BETTER.

EOS 1 1 18 [Information] There is a group like AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) that could be a great support for your friend.  EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I have dealt with friends like this, but the sooner he can get help for his alcohol issues, it could better your relationship with him.

EOS 3 0 11 If he died it would be OK, I would mourn him and move on. But I have never had to give up a pet before. I just think most people. wont take care of him like I do. Because he is still alive, I will worry about him  EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I understand a little bit of how you feel. My dog died recently and it was really hard when the vet had to put him down. I was really sad and would cry when I thought of him ort the things we used to do together.  EOS 3 0 13 Yes, I was depressed for 6 months after my parrot died, but eventually we move on. I dont know that I can move on after giving him up  EOS 3 1 14 [Others] Would you ever consider getting a pet that is not as loud? I am not suggesting that you replace him.  EOS 3 0 15 No, except a seeing dog  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] I am concerned that if you don't have a pet to care for you may have a more difficult time to recover and thrive. Mourning is a process and it might be easier if you can hare your ;love with another pet.  EOS 3 0 17 No other pets. I need to move and cannot take him with me.  EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] A seeing eye dog is a great idea. You are trying to think of ways to help yourself and that is really important. You are also reaching out and sharing your feelings. Do you have any friends with pets that you can visit with from time to time?  EOS 3 0 19 It isn't about a new pet it is about worrying that he will not be taken care of.  EOS 3 0 20 I contacted a rescue place to get him a new home.  EOS 3 1 21 [Information] I am sorry that makes a lot of sense. I am really thankful that you are sharing your feelings and expressing them.

[contxt]	7 0 0 Hello, I would like to talk to you about my academic pressures  EOS 7 0 1 I hope you may be able to help  EOS 7 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes here to listen and to help you in anyway I can  EOS 7 0 3 I guess the problem is that I am faced with impending deadlines with my studies, and that I am not that great with my organization or time management, and compounded with distractions.  EOS 7 0 4 Thank you  EOS 7 0 5 So I don't know if you have any tips or personal experiences on how to deal with such issues  EOS 7 1 6 [Question] By any chance have you thought about trying out some time management class?  EOS 7 0 7 No, because time management I feel is something that I have to resolve on my own, and I have enough courses on my plate right now.  EOS 7 0 8 But I guess for time management, I tend to be distracted easily or spend too long on other stuff outside of my studies  EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh ok I see. I have actually been in this type of situation before, and I took those classes and they actually helped.  EOS 7 0 10 I see. So would you be able to share some tips on time management?  EOS 7 1 11 [Others] Yes sure I can .  EOS 7 0 12 like specifically, I don't know. I am just going with my instincts and my instincts aren't great or mature  EOS 7 1 13 [Information] Find out where your wasting you time? Try creating time management goals? Implement a Time management Plan  EOS 7 0 14 well I guess I can put out like a time table on what I should get through in the day, etc.  EOS 7 0 15 setting alarm clocks on set times, etc.  EOS 7 1 16 [Others] Yes thats a great idea.  EOS 7 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] You could also reward yourself when you have done a good job  EOS 7 0 18 But also, with the ongoing pandemic, it doesn't help either. For example, I am trapped at home and it feels claustrophobic but it's not safe to go out either. And my mind wanders in such circumstances too.  EOS 7 0 19 yes that's good advice. I have done it but sometimes I overdo my rewards like take too long of a break, etc.  EOS 7 0 20 so in my opinion, I need moderation and maturity.  EOS 7 1 21 [Others] I can relate to that as well. This pandemic has gotten everyone down.  EOS 7 0 22 for sure. It's really really distracting and has made my life and mind wander aimlessly.  EOS 7 0 23 I was a lot more productive with my life and studies before March or so  EOS 7 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Dont be so down on yourself you are mature. Just need a little help managing some things.  EOS 7 0 25 Yeah true. On that point, I know I have done well before, and I know I can pass, but I don't like the direction I am going in and these new trends.  EOS 7 0 26 so I feel disappointed and guilty because I know I am better than this and ought to be.  EOS 7 1 27 [Others] If you do some of those suggestions I believe you will be just fine. 
[reference_response]	if you do some of those suggestions i believe you will be just fine.

[situation]	My best friend can be kind of a tool when he is drinking alcohol.

[contxt]	3 0 4 I feel like he didn't help at all. Up to that point we mostly just talked about politics or whatever. I'm a charity patient, he get's paid through the organization, but because of my financial difficulties, I'm not paying. I think he saw that as a shortcoming on my part.  EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that is definitely one way to look at it. But another way to look at your situation is you figured out a therapist who isn't worth seeing. That brings you one step closer to finding one who does actually help you. All you need to do now, is do some research and find someone who has your best interest in mind. Believe me, there are great therapists and terrible therapists. You just need to find one of the good ones now.  EOS 3 0 6 I'm not sure I can find another who I don't have to pay. My insurance has a $20 copay and if I had to pay that I wouldn't be able to buy groceries. This came through my religious organization and he was the only one available in my area. I guess I just have to find another way to cope  EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] If you have financial issues and you need the help from a therapist you deserve the treatment. One thing you can do is apply for Medicaid and EBT. The state you live in will give you money to pay for groceries and to get help from a therapist for free if you don't have a high enough income. It may be worth looking into because all you really need to do is fill out some forms and likely you will be approved. When I was younger and struggling, this had happened to me and I received both of these benefits and it totally turned my life around. I think it can do the same for you as well.  EOS 3 0 8 I'm on Medicare and supplemental insurance. I didn't know you can, possibly, see one for free. I'll look into that. That is helpful.  EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Sure thing. What are some of the coping strategies you've been practicing with your prior therapist?  EOS 3 0 10 I asked him to help me with some but all he would say is that I should stop vaping (I switched from smoking some years ago). I told him it feels like I'm walking a tightrope and he's suggesting I get rid of the safety net without giving me something else, some other way to cope. He said that's not what a therapist is supposed to do and that my resistance shows I don't really want to change.  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I can see how that comment he made would be frustrating. If you feel like vaping, you should continue to do; however, what happens if say you go somewhere and find yourself in a stressful position? What would be strategy you could use in order to recenter yourself? Strategies are important as they balance us when we experience stressors that through us off. Have you ever thought about meditation?  EOS 3 0 12 I asked him about meditation and if he could recommend something. He wouldn't. I have only been able to do it successfully once, at the meditation gardens when I visited my son in San Diego some years back. Since I can't always get to that kind of natural setting, I was hoping he could give me some resources. Do you know of any place I can find some?  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Oh yes. Me personally, I like to scour youtube and find an environment with a sound I enjoy such as the beach. When I listen to that sound, I try to put myself by closing my eyes while sitting on the floor and breathing deeply for some time. It may be worth a try for you. I hope it helps you. Good luck!

I want another girlfriend, but I'm afraid that I'll never find another one like my last . I don't want to go through the turmoil again.  EOS 2 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] breakups can be really hard!  EOS 2 1 4 [Question] can i ask why she dumped you?  EOS 2 0 5 Yes. And this one has been so hard on me. I've lost my appetite. I have trouble sleeping.  EOS 2 0 6 She said that "we are just not compatible" which sounds like BS. I think she was cheating on me, too.  EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] sounds like you are pretty depressed. that is understandable though  EOS 2 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] if she was cheating she wanst that good of a girl friend. if she said you were not compatible then it sounds to me like she has someone else  EOS 2 0 9 Yeah, but I really liked her a lot. I think that maybe we just needed more time. She didn't know me well enough.  EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] as hard and lonely as it is right now, it was a good thing. yiu seem really great, and you deserve way better than that!  EOS 2 0 11 Thanks! I keep telling myself that, but I'm worried that the same thing will happen with the next girlfriend.  EOS 2 1 12 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] it can be hard letting people in so they can get to know you  EOS 2 1 13 [Question] fear and worry is natural, expecially after being hurt. can you think of anything you could do differnt in a new relationship if you entered one?  EOS 2 0 14 I wonder that too. Did I shut her out? Was she needing more from me?  EOS 2 0 15 Maybe I could be more open? I'm not sure. After this experience, I really don't trust women.  EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] personally, i think dating right now is hard with all the covid crap. its hard to go on dates and do things other than sit in front of a tv. it makes things difficult  EOS 2 1 17 [Question] do you trust your mom?  EOS 2 0 18 Maybe it is better to wait a bit. But I feel like I need to DO something to get better, not just wait around.  EOS 2 0 19 In matters of the heart? No, I don't trust my mom. In matters of the kitchen, yes.  EOS 2 1 20 [Self-disclosure] lol i was adopted. i don't trust my mom. either of them... lol that was a horrible example  EOS 2 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] what i was getting at awas maybe changing your sentance to i dont trust many women  EOS 2 0 22 OH! Ok. I see what you are saying. I should be careful about generalization. That's a good point. One bad experience shouldn't color my view.  EOS 2 1 23 [Question] if you try to get into a new relationship with the mentality that woment cant be trusted.... what re the chances you open up and let the next girl get to know you?  EOS 2 1 24 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you seem like you have a good head on your shoulders!

EOS 0 0 4 my husband and i have been fighting alot recently over his infidelity  EOS 0 0 5 its really taken a toll on me. we have tried several counselors but nothing seems to be working  EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry to hear that. I can understand how frustrating that can be. I have had my fair share of boyfriends cheat on me.  EOS 0 0 7 weve been married for 14 years. I feel broken by this. we have 2 kids and my daughter, the eldest knows  EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure that you have been trying to do everything that you can do to help the situation. It sounds like you choosing counseling was a good start. It shows how much you care.  EOS 0 0 9 yes but my husband doesnt want to fi things. hes happy with having 2 women  EOS 0 0 10 ive had to buy a recorder and put it in his car. The things i heard were horrible.  EOS 0 0 11 he found out though.  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] It is rough for our children to see adult stuff like this. They might not be able to understand. I would suggest trying to set down and talk to them about it, when you are ready.  EOS 0 0 13 I dont want my youngest to know. He loves his father and i dont want to destroy that  EOS 0 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] How do you feel about your husband not wanting to fix things? Is that something that you are considering?  EOS 0 0 15 i feel horrible. Im actually trying to fix things while he texts her every day  EOS 0 0 16 i dont know whats gonna happen  EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a very thoughtful thing for you to put your son first.

I tried to attend the lectures, but I was falling behind  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I wonder if you can contact the professor and go over your exam with him/her to set your anxiety at ease?  EOS 4 0 12 Unfortunately I cannot since he does not teach during the winter semester  EOS 4 1 13 [Question] how do you get your exam grade and test papers back?  EOS 4 0 14 I took it last week, he will not release until the end of this week. I will await my remediation papers  EOS 4 1 15 [Question] have you spoken to people in the class with you?  EOS 4 0 16 Yea we had a big cheating group since it wasn't on examsoft but we all struggled hard  EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] maybe he'll curve the grade then if a lot of people didn't do well  EOS 4 0 18 Nah it's a professional class. No curves since our class size is only 25 people  EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] oh wow. hopefully you can re-take it then if you really didn't do well.

But every day is a new day :)  EOS 4 0 26 I'm majoring in biology. It is very tough I'll tell you that  EOS 4 0 27 This semester I took 19 credits.

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hello  EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today?  EOS 4 0 2 Just a bit sad. The holidays always seem to do that.  EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Are you wanting to get back to work?  EOS 4 0 4 Work is a good distraction from life.  EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Well yes I can concur with that. I have often found work takes my mind off my problems.  EOS 4 0 6 Work can set you free from your own thoughts  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well that's not a phrase that I much like. But there's nothing wrong with liking your job.  EOS 4 0 8 Oh sorry, wasn't saying it in the same context of Hitler. It actually predates the Nazi's . But nonetheless it can be taken the wrong way. My bad.  EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] It's okay :) I did not realise that it predated Hitler. On another note, tell me about your job?  EOS 4 0 10 Just your typical dead end job working for a corporation. Got to make the mortgage payments. But given how many people are out of work we are supposed to be happy to have a job.  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Well, a lot of people have been made redundant due to the pandemic - but that is not a reason why people should be happy with a dead end job. Would you consider something else?  EOS 4 0 12 Yeah just don't have the confidence to find a new job. I get paid a decent wage and the work isn't hard. It just isn't mentally rewarding.  EOS 4 1 13 [Question] It's okay to coast for a while if it's paying the bills but in the long term it won't be very satisfying. What would be your chances of retraining?

EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What can I help you with tonight>  EOS 3 0 4 My girlfriend broke up with me and I think I'm suffering from depression now. Everything feels like a chore and I'm sad all of the time.  EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] From what you are telling me, you are very upset about your girlfriend breaking up with you and you don't feel motivated to do anything, is that right?  EOS 3 0 6 Yeah  EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell how anxious and upset that is making you feel.  EOS 3 0 8 I feel like a heavy weight is on me all the time. I'm not enjoying things I used to in the past.  EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I can definitely understand that feeling as I had an ex who cheated on me and had a child with another man, so I know how hard that is.

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hi there, I was hoping to get some support. I'm having a hard time with things.  EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Ho, Can you please tell me specifically what things you are having a hard time with.  EOS 4 0 2 I broke up with my boyfriend because he cheated on me.  EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you saying that your boyfriend broke up with you. Is that correct  EOS 4 0 4 Yes, that's correct. I'm heartbroken!  EOS 4 0 5 Wait, no. I broke up with my boyfriend. he didn't break up with me  EOS 4 1 6 [Others] I am sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what led to the breakup  EOS 4 0 7 I caught him cheating on me with my best friend. They were together at the movies and I caught them  EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok, that sounds like a terrible thing. Just know that it is not your fault that this happen. It is not a reflection on you.  EOS 4 0 9 Are you sure? Because I keep wondering what I did wrong for him to cheat  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] You did nothing wrong, when people cheat it is their own issue they must deal with. You must be feeling horrible,but know that it will be ok, there is someone who will treat you with more respect  EOS 4 0 11 I appreciate you saying that. It makes me feel a bit better! Do you have any advice about how I can take my mind off of things?  EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Do not let this affect your self esteem, as you are a valuable person. Take long walks, spend time enjoying your own company and know that you are worth it  EOS 4 1 13 [Others] You can also try spending time just talking to others as just friends but not getting emotionally involved.  EOS 4 0 14 Taking a long walk is great advice. Perhaps I will try doing that more often. The fresh air always does me good.  EOS 4 0 15 I have a lot of friends I can talk to about this but unfortunately COVID makes it difficult to see them.  EOS 4 1 16 [Information] Great, it will make you feel so much better about yourself and help you put things in perspective. You will eventually see your ex-partner for who he is.  EOS 4 0 17 I have some weight to lose, so taking a walk would help me with that also. Added bonus!  EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Great, so you can look and feel great. With COVID around, it is not the best time to go out and mingle but you can surely look around online and finds some online friends so that when social distancing is no longer an issue you can meet others  EOS 4 0 19 That's not a bad idea either. I think I'm feeling much better now  EOS 4 1 20 [Others] Wonderful, I am glad I can be of assistance  EOS 4 1 21 [Others] Have a wonderful day  EOS 4 0 22 You too :)  EOS 4 1 23 [Others] Thank You

[contxt]	1 0 2 Today there is nothing to feel about that. When I think of it or have some situation to recall the previous incident I get very angered on my friend, who did not help me, in spite of my volunteer help to him on a similar situation.  EOS 1 1 3 [Question] Would you like to give me a few more details?  EOS 1 0 4 So simple. I was in need of money, urgently, for my business. I helped him when he was in a similar situation. Now I am in situation, previously he was when I helped. I expected my friend surely will help. But he did not. This has put me some anger on him. This was a situation that happened 1 year before. Now I recall this for chatting.  EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Well, are you sure that he could have definitely afforded to loan you anything?  EOS 1 0 6 Yes. That was well within his limits and he should have obliged.  EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Well, the thing is, just because you had lent to him does not mean he is obliged to help you  EOS 1 1 8 [Others] Though of course it would have been the courteous thing to do  EOS 1 0 9 Thank you for your understanding and feeling. I feel some relax over the anger, just by your words.  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Is it possible to try to talk to him calmly and tell him exactly how he has made you feel?  EOS 1 0 11 Yes. I tried calmly of the situation. He told accepting as the situation has passed. I am not sure he has fully understood. As the situation passed, he says okay.  EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I think you need to decide whether you just just let it go or whether you cant' and won't be able to continue the friendship  EOS 1 0 13 However I continue the friendship not affected by this harassment.  EOS 1 1 14 [Question] Aren't you worried that it might rankle with you and surface again at some time to affect the friendship?  EOS 1 0 15 My behavior with him will not be affected because of this. But whenever I happen to think or recall of this I get to anger of it unavoidably. And cools off in some time.  EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] It is understandable. I hope that I have been able to help you a little and thank you for talking it out!  EOS 1 0 17 I need some more to chat with you. Is there any suggestion not to get angered again, even when having some recall or thought of the situation. That has been my problem.  EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought of trying any meditation exercises or breathing exercises... just to help you stay calm?  EOS 1 0 19 Generally I am cool, not an emotional person. If I need any special training, it should be only because of this. If there is some simple way that could help.  EOS 1 1 20 [Self-disclosure] I think you should give it a try - I have personally found breathing exercises very helpful! Thank you for talking, I must go now.  EOS 1 0 21 However it is not at all required. That anger does not affect me, just only feeling for some minutes. I let it go.  EOS 1 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] can you press quit and do the survey? It has to be done your end:) We've done ten turns each. 
[reference_response]	can you press quit and do the survey? it has to be done your end: ) we've done ten turns each.

She calls me up with terrible stories and I listen even though it pains me, because she needs someone to listen.  EOS 4 0 18 Addiction is an affliction I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy now that I have seen her living it  EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] Wow that is a good sign atleast she is coming to you to vent out. That is were you need to punch in an opportunity to seek help from a professional and convince her in such a way she will come down and accept it.  EOS 4 0 20 I have encouraged her to set up appointments with professionals. Sometimes she has, but does not follow through, the addiction gets in the way, it's more powerful than her desire to stop. And I can't just drive her/ accompany her to an appointment because she lives in a different city  EOS 4 0 21 But yes, I am happy she trusts me enough to confide in me  EOS 4 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] You have such a good heart so hang in there she will come to you with a bang.

EOS 4 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] Is there any way you could move to her city for a while and help her out. If so she will not skip any appointment and it will help her way.  EOS 4 0 27 unfortunately i cannot afford to move  EOS 4 0 28 the rents are too high in her city  EOS 4 1 29 [Providing Suggestions] That is understandable. Is there any option she can move in with you so you offer help.  EOS 4 0 30 hell no. she lies and steals because of her addction there is no way i could live with her, but thank you for the suggestion  EOS 4 1 31 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that I thought close contact will make her vigil and makes her more responsible.  EOS 4 0 32 I'll tell you though....this was the issue I chose....but it's a past issue....she is now 3 months clean and doing well :)  EOS 4 0 33 i am so relieved and happy for her  EOS 4 0 34 just wanted to end up with some good news for you :)  EOS 4 1 35 [Others] Oh very nice to hear and super proud of her.

Then, I'll use the extra time to polish up my resume.  EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] the only thing you can really do right now is to just sign up unemployment and start looking for another job i am sure you will find another job soon  EOS 0 0 26 Okay, I like the idea of taking little steps.  EOS 0 1 27 [Others] yes do that and stay positive  EOS 0 0 28 Do you have any suggestions to stay positive?

EOS 4 0 4 I did but they want to meet in person and I just can't  EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are trying. Have you expressed to them why you feel the way you do?  EOS 4 0 6 I've tried to but I don't think they take the COVID seriously.  EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That can be hard when there are different viewpoints on such a big issue.  EOS 4 0 8 It sure is. Do you have any suggestions?  EOS 4 1 9 [Question] Do you think that having a friend intervene and having a third party help out could help?  EOS 4 0 10 That could possibly work. My friend is so much more receptive to my other friend in hearing her out. Maybe she could assist.  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a great idea.  EOS 4 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are thinking of alternate paths to work through the friendship.

I can assure you that your family can understand it  EOS 5 1 3 [Providing Suggestions] How about an online job?  EOS 5 0 4 Yes,it just very frustrating. My family member has taken another restaurant job only to lose it again for the same reasons, COVID.  EOS 5 0 5 They have been going to temp services also.  EOS 5 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I also worked in a coffee house and it has been closed for this damn virus.  EOS 5 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I feel sad too.

EOS 5 0 10 So this family member gave up their apartment, moved back in with family, still fighting unemployment and going to food banks. It's crazy  EOS 5 0 11 They are doing what they can but when we talk about it, it's hard to believe in these modern times we are in such a mess  EOS 5 1 12 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I wish this virus ends soon.

EOS 0 0 7 I can't get motivated, it doesn't seem worth it.  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Hey I've been there too, but it really helped me meditating and going out with nature to clear my mind of things. You should try it!  EOS 0 0 9 What do you meditate about?  EOS 0 1 10 [Others] Nothing special, just sit in my room in silence. Listen to tutorials on youtube to meditate  EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] They get me relaxed and motivated for the day :)  EOS 0 0 12 I feel like I would sit there and worry about things I have not done yet.  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] That's part of meditation! I too worry while meditating, but when i'm listening to the videos and following instructions all those worries go away :) If that doesn't help you, you can go out in nature to clear your mind off things. Being in the wild really motivates me to continue.  EOS 0 0 14 Maybe it will calm me down. Does it make it easier to concentrate?  EOS 0 1 15 [Information] Meditating absolutely does since the whole point is to clear your mind off things and concentrate on the task ahead. And the wild? that's whole other experience because you either concentrate on things or you get mesmerized by nature :)  EOS 0 0 16 That sounds amazing, I should give it a try :)  EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] Please do! You can try it with friends or alone. With friends can be a more fun experience while alone can be more spiritual or calming  EOS 0 1 18 [Information] I have tried both and both are amazing :) 
[reference_response]	i have tried both and both are amazing : )
[hypothesis_response]	i think that you should give that a try. i think it will help you feel better and calm you down : ) you can do it! i think you can also meditate in the forest or even on your own. i'll bet that would help a lot too.

EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have any family or friends that you could talk to that may could help you out until the first of the year?  EOS 0 0 10 Yes same here. I have three children under the age of 6 so they are still in the innocent stage  EOS 0 0 11 Unfortunately no i am not good terms with my family.  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I am sorry to hear that. Have you spoke to your husband about the stress you feel from his hours being cut?

[contxt]	0 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I understand that sometimes being able to interpret things from someone who can communicate well can make the difference in understanding things.  EOS 0 0 11 Yeah, it can be very stressful when I don't understand though. I'm normally a very good student so it's easy to be hard on myself. But it's good to hear that this is a pretty common experience  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I had a 100% average almost in high school and still struggled with the class. I kind of wish they videotaped the classes that I could rewind and go back to at the time of college. When I got to grad school, I ended up being able to audio record sessions and understood things so much better because I could reference the books while listening to a lecture. That made so much difference.  EOS 0 0 13 Yeah that sounds really nice. One of the hardest things was that the professor would never go back and explain what he did, so a problem might be 20 minutes long and if you got confused 3-4 minutes in you were just lost for the rest of it  EOS 0 1 14 [Information] Lots of research also has shown that getting enough sleep is important for performance as well.  EOS 0 0 15 That is actually one thing I'm pretty good at. I'm miserable when I'm tired, so I almost always get 7-8 hours a night.  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are making efforts to do your best to sleep and understand the materials. You can give yourself a pat on the back for all the great efforts!  EOS 0 0 17 Thanks! It's reassuring to know other people felt the same way with this course. Sometimes I felt like I was dumb or lazy because I didn't understand, but it sounds like it's just challenging and those feelings are normal  EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes you have to give yourself more credit because you are doing a good job.  EOS 0 0 19 Yeah, that has always been hard for me, but I'll try to be deliberate about that  EOS 0 1 20 [Question] Do you feel better about the situation?  EOS 0 0 21 I do, thanks!  EOS 0 1 22 [Others] Great, I hope you keep encouraged and working hard toward your goals because you deserve the very best with your hard work.  EOS 0 0 23 I am, thank you.

I completely understand how you feel in that aspect.

What have you found recently to make extra money?  EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] I have just started using ibotta for my groceries... its not much but once i think ive finally got it figured out. I've been on reddit the past few days looking for websites like mturk but I havent tried any that i feel compare yet.  EOS 3 0 8 ok  EOS 3 0 9 i am in school and do a little 2 hours work  EOS 3 0 10 which could not fetch me enough money, I need to pay bills, feed myself and pay school fees. I want to try mturk or do u have any other means of getting another income which is more better than mturk ?  EOS 3 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed and excluded by your family, I'm sorry  EOS 3 0 12 I need to start living like an orphan  EOS 3 1 13 [Others] I have tried pinecone, focus group, and a few others. none compare to mturk in my opinion. How long have you been using mturk? it definitely gets better with time. I'm still figuring it out but it has helped more than anything else i've tried. Did your family say why they wont help you out? maybe they are just unable to  EOS 3 0 14 they are just callous and selfish. I can't be working for them as a house boy.  EOS 3 0 15 pinecone! what is the procedure  EOS 3 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] Do you still live with them? Sometimes our own family takes advantage of us without meaning to. I'm sure that makes you feel unappreciated.  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] It's surveys... I think that one is supposed to be 3$ each but i've never qualified for one. Most that claim to be higher paying just ask you tons of questions and then say you dont qualify.  EOS 3 0 18 I moved out from the fucking house before pandemic  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] i saw one i'm going to try let me look up the name of it.. a lot of people were talking about it on an mturk forum saying positive things.  EOS 3 0 20 ok  EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] Ok heres a few I am going to look into that i saw people talking about... microworker, clickworker, crowdsource  EOS 3 1 22 [Information] Reddit has helped me learn how to earn more on mturk  EOS 3 0 23 ok , Reddit?  EOS 3 1 24 [Information] yeah I have learned a lot by reading other peoples questions and suggestions. Things I wouldnt have even thought of.

[contxt]	0 1 3 [Question] Have you spoken to anyone at the college about this?  EOS 0 0 4 Yes, but they haven't been much help unfortunately. My classes are online and finals are due when finals are due. They are not giving any wiggle room (3)  EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It must make you feel quite trapped knowing that the college aren't cutting you a bit of slack considering you are still recovering from a serious illness. It sounds like you are trying your best and not giving up already.  EOS 0 0 6 No I cannot give up at all. My scholarship requires me to maintain a certain GPA and I can't afford to lose it (4)  EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] It's good to hear that you're not giving up. Sometimes in these situations, you just have to do your best and then at least you know you did what you could. I like to tell myself in these situations that if there are no other avenues to explore, you just have to 'go with the flow' and don't beat yourself up thinking about it over and over - if there's nothing you can do, just do your best to ride it out  EOS 0 0 8 I know, there is just so much riding on these finals. I have great grades so I'm praying that I pass without any issues and that I don't bomb even one of them (5)  EOS 0 0 9 Are you still there?  EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] If you tried hard previously then you may come out the other end having done very well!

(7)  EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's totally understandable. I think even without the COVID situation, you would still be anxious. It's totally natural. Not that that discounts how you feel. Do you agree?  EOS 0 0 15 Yes, that is true. I just can't quite seem to quiet my mind. (8)  EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Well, I've tried meditating a few times before which doesn;t take it all away, it just takes the edge off! I used a guided meditation app. I also listened to white noise when I went to sleep as I was having trouble sleeping. I find even if you're mind is just taken away from it all for a few minute, it can re-balance you a little  EOS 0 0 17 I've tried watching some comedy shows and listening to music to take my mind off of it. It works sometimes (9)  EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe you should do more of that, it sounds like a good idea? Don't feel guilty for doing so either as it acts as a 'medicine'. If the 'medicine' works then take it  EOS 0 0 19 I will try to focus more on that when I'm not studying and see if it keeps helping then (10)  EOS 0 1 20 [Others] Sounds like a plan! It's certainly worth giving it a go. We need a break from it all sometimes or we'd all go mad.

We started talking and one night we hooked up.  EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you're physically attracted to Doug and had a one-time encounter with him. Is that right?  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] can you tell me more about how you're feeling now?  EOS 4 0 5 Well, actually this has been going on for 7 months. I hooked up with him after a month of talking.  EOS 4 0 6 I'm ready to end this situation because I want the more emotional stuff I know Doug can't give. How do I get out?  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure it's frustrating that you're not getting the emotional support you need. It's great that you are reaching out to communicate with someone.  EOS 4 0 8 I heard of people falling for a fling or one night stand but this has gone on for months. Add to that, I see him at work. He's married and I don't see this as more than a long term hook up. Have you ever experienced something like this?  EOS 4 0 9 If you never experienced this do you know of anyone who has? What did they do to get out of this type of relationship if you want to call it that?  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I can sense your frustration, and his marriage just adds to that. I've known lots of people who've ended up in relationships with married people.  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Just reaching out to talk with someone else is a great first step.  EOS 4 0 12 What did those people do to end the relationship if you want to call it that?  EOS 4 0 13 You keep saying it's good to reach out. I'm reaching out to you trying to find a way to turn off my emotions for this man.  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes, a good first step is to reach out to friends who can help you fill your time and avoid interactions with him.  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] And co-workers often can help you find ways to avoid him in the office. Are others aware of the relationship who can help you with that?  EOS 4 0 16 My friends don't know about my situation with Doug. I do suspect some people at work are putting us eating lunch and taking walks together as something more. +  EOS 4 0 17 Doug make my sing and makes my body come alive but his presence is starting to break my heart because this situation is not going anywhere. I need help! It's not Doug's problem it's mine!  EOS 4 0 18 I don't like his wife because if she was treating him well he wouldn't be with me. So why doesn't she just let him go?  EOS 4 0 19 I'm starting to think if she was out the picture Doug and I could be together in a real relationship you know what I mean?  EOS 4 1 20 [Others] I can hear your anguish, and I understand your frustration. It's not clear to me, though, that Doug is being honest with you or with his wife.  EOS 4 1 21 [Question] You mentioned that Doug can't provide the emotional support that you need. Do you think he's being fully honest with you about his relationship with his wife?

They don’t seem to hear me. One friend said she thought I was blowing it out of proportion. But that’s the way I feel  EOS 3 0 12 What approach would you take if you were me?

[situation]	Ever since the insurgent of Covid-19 ,I was hit hard when I was relieved from my full-time job for a non justifiable reason. I blame it to Covid because business was slow and it affected production. I was so frustrated and I didn't know what next to do as I had past due bills and family to take care of. I started applying for government benefits none was fast coming forth and requires a lot of processing time. I later got a part-time job that the pay was low and i could not put up with the bills .it was really tough. I almost went into depression but I did not give up home. Recently I got a full-time job but I have been scared and anxious because they keep laying off employees weekly. I wouldn't want to go through the terrible situation I had last time.

[contxt]	0 0 1 Hi, I have been going through a lot of stress with school and am also sad and lonely as of late and not sure how to make myself feel better  EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have had a lot of stress with school lately and are struggling to keep yourself cheerful?  EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Is there something in particular at school that is stressing you out? Exams? Relationships?  EOS 0 0 4 Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well.  EOS 0 0 5 Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough.  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now?  EOS 0 0 7 I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that.  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense.  EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.  EOS 0 0 11 Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best?  EOS 0 0 12 I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating.  EOS 0 1 13 [Others] Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule. 
[reference_response]	yes, stick to one subject at a time. for example, if you think 12 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. when done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.
[hypothesis_response]	that sounds like a great idea. it may help to start with one class and then take a break after that. this is the first step of focusing on yourself and getting motivated to study.

EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have an issue with your back, are you experiencing constant pain?  EOS 1 0 4 yes, it is like a real Charlie Horse that just won't stop.  EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Have you been doing an activity that has triggered this? Or have you woken up and felt a difference?  EOS 1 0 6 It has been going on for over ten years now. I can't hardly walk and I can't hardly sit still.  EOS 1 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so to confirm you have constant back pain and this has been going on for over 10 years and you just want a solution to mitigate that pain.  EOS 1 0 8 Yes, I have had back surgery, tried Yoga, and chiropractors, and physical therapy. Nothing has worked.  EOS 1 1 9 [Information] I know that constant pain is definitely up there with one of the most difficult things a person can deal with. It can also affect your mental health over time but there are solutions out there that can help.  EOS 1 0 10 It is just hard, waking up in the middle of the night with pain and not being able to go back to sleep. It drives me nuts some days and I just stay away from everyone.  EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] from what I can tell you have tried many Solutions. I can see that you are committed to finding something that can work for you. personally I think it is only a matter of time until you find the right combination for you if you can stay positive.  EOS 1 0 12 I try to hide the pain from my family because the man of the house is suppose to be strong and provide for his family. I have a very loving wife and a set of twin boys that just turned 13. I am blessed in so many ways but I still seem to have to suffer to enjoy it.  EOS 1 1 13 [Self-disclosure] if I'm being honest I can relate to this. I have a young son and a small family myself. I have had problems with my hearing and tinnitus that is manageable at the moment but constant. in feels like nobody understands just how difficult this can be.  EOS 1 0 14 I feel your pain, I have came a long way in managing the pain mentally. I try to block it out and keep my mind busy to not think about it. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] ok so I assume you spoken to many medical professionals about this. have you had a diagnosis?

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hello  EOS 4 1 1 [Others] Hello, how are you today?  EOS 4 0 2 My friend has passed away and I'm having a hard time dealing with it at the moment.  EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I'm so sorry to hear that. I've had a close friend pass away years ago, and I understand it is a hard thing to deal with.  EOS 4 0 4 Yes we were close, the funeral was a few weeks ago. I miss him  EOS 4 1 5 [Question] Do you have other friends there for you to help you through this tough time?  EOS 4 0 6 Yes I do have a few friends, actually we have some friends in common but I don't want to burden them with my sadness. Maybe I'm being soft?  EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] I doubt if they would see you as being soft. Maybe your mutual friends would like someone to talk to as well? You could perhaps share some stories about your friend and cheer each other up.  EOS 4 0 8 I think it would help to think of the good times yes. the only problem is this could leave me feeling a lot more sad. I know my friends miss him too so maybe we could link up?  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's a great idea. You could help each other and celebrate his life, keeping his memory alive.  EOS 4 0 10 I was thinking of starting a Facebook page but I know that trolls can Target those.  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] That's a great idea. Maybe have a Memorial Service in his name at a place he frequented often, this way, no trolls and all the people who knew him could share their personal stories about him.  EOS 4 0 12 yeah that's not a bad idea. also may be speaking to somebody about it might help, I'm just reluctant at the moment as I don't want to appear weak.  EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] Let me reassure you that you would not appear weak. Death is something that everyone deals with in their own ways, and talking to someone about it could be the best way for you to deal with these emotions. Have you felt like giving up or extreme depression after his death?  EOS 4 0 14 thanks for your concern by once a extreme depression or giving up. it's more just a constant sense of grief that just doesn't seem to go away. I think I will get over in time. I just wonder what I can do to speed that process up?  EOS 4 1 15 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you're going through the normal grieving process and that time and talking about it can be of a huge help.  EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have taken the first step of healing by speaking with me about it. That is admirable!  EOS 4 0 17 thanks for that. it's good to know that this is normal and if it carries on I think I speak to somebody about this in more detail.  EOS 4 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm glad to hear that. I wish you the best and believe you will get through this! 
[reference_response]	i'm glad to hear that. i wish you the best and believe you will get through this!
[hypothesis_response]	i think you have done the best you can with this, but you can't exactly avoid what's going on. you can only avoid what is going on, so you can choose what is happening, not what is right or what is not.

[contxt]	6 0 0 Hello, how are you?  EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling?  EOS 6 0 2 I'm alright, honestly I'm feeling rather ashamed. The reason for that and the problem that I'm facing is that I've had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and I'm only 24 years old. Right now in my life I'm ready to seek help, but I'm having a lot of anxiety about it because I'm very worried about how others will judge me. I'm worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I'm ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I've made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help.  EOS 6 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am in a good position to help you as I am in the same situation. Please know you are not alone.  EOS 6 1 4 [Providing Suggestions] I would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later!  EOS 6 1 5 [Question] Hello? Are you wanting to talk?  EOS 6 0 6 Yes of course I didn't hear it go off, my apologies. I really appreciate that, it really is helpful knowing that I'm not the only one who feels this way  EOS 6 0 7 I really know that that's what I need to do, and I am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know  EOS 6 1 8 [Question] What level of alcohol consumption do you have?  EOS 6 0 9 no matter how hard it seems, maybe it wont be when I actual do it  EOS 6 1 10 [Information] Trust me everyone will be very sympathetic :). Everyone there will be in the same place  EOS 6 1 11 [Information] And the longer you keep drinking the more damage you are doing to yourself  EOS 6 0 12 and quite a bit, about half a gallon or more a day . And thank you, I really do appreciate your help. I know that and I know its time for me to better my life because its no way to live ya know. Id like to grow up and have a normal life (:  EOS 6 1 13 [Others] I am not sure how much half a gallon is to you ... I am in the UK and I know it differs between the US and UK :)

[contxt]	2 1 14 [Others] Ah .. that makes it both more complicated and more simple.  EOS 2 1 15 [Others] At the very least you are living independently  EOS 2 1 16 [Question] Do you have financial independence as well?  EOS 2 0 17 But I still feel like I have to please them and make decisions based on what I say. I guess it's like abuse but it a different context. I always worry that what I do may not please them.  EOS 2 1 18 [Question] Have you tried talking to them about how you feel or do you feel that they would not listen to you?  EOS 2 0 19 I do. It's kinda complicated because when COVID hit I lost my job and they were supportive saying they would help me out until I got back on my feet. They don't hold that against me, thankfully.  EOS 2 0 20 I have. Let me explain more  EOS 2 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Okay I am happy to listen :)  EOS 2 0 22 Thank you : ) I went to therapy for 4 years when I was away from them. 2 months ago I got the courage to talk to them about how I felt. It was to a point where I couldn't function anymore. They listened and said they are sorry. And it was all good for a while until it seems like they went back to the same thing again.  EOS 2 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is great that you at least did get up the courage to approach them - that is a brilliant first step.  EOS 2 0 24 I come from a family who don't have a lot of ambitious in life. Talking about my cousins and aunts. So my parents really focused on my to be the perfect individual.  EOS 2 1 25 [Question] Ah that might help explain things. So they are pinning the hopes of the whole family on you because you are academically successful?  EOS 2 0 26 My dad also regrets not being able to continue his studies because of my grandparents wrong doings. He had to leave school.  EOS 2 0 27 Academically and musically. IDK other talents I guess.  EOS 2 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] I wonder if you could suggest to your dad that he goes back to school himself rather than living through you?  EOS 2 0 29 Like as a whole human being I should be perfect.  EOS 2 1 30 [Others] I hope I have been able to be of help to you but I am afraid I need to see someone else now. Thank you for talking though and I wish you all the very best in future  EOS 2 0 31 Ok. Thank you for your time. Have a good one.  EOS 2 1 32 [Others] you too!  EOS 2 1 33 [Others] Can you press quit first as it has to be done from your end :)  EOS 2 0 34 Oh sorry. I thought I just did.  EOS 2 1 35 [Others] it can be temperamental :)

[contxt]	6 1 6 [Question] What caused you to leave the job?  EOS 6 0 7 COVID-19 risk and exposure. I felt like the company wasn't doing enough to protect the employees.  EOS 6 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand that reasoning. I was also very anxious when the pandemic first started due to working in a grocery store.  EOS 6 0 9 Yeah, I was in retail also aha worked in a convenience store with lots of foot traffic  EOS 6 1 10 [Question] Did they offer you any type of leave due to COVID?  EOS 6 0 11 No, I was relatively new after leaving the military and was looking for a job so no leave days available  EOS 6 0 12 I really liked the employees and everyone was kind though. It's just the risk of exposure that made me stressed  EOS 6 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I understand, I can tell through typing with you that this has made you very anxious.  EOS 6 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Did you get any contact information from the employees you worked with while you were there? Often it helps to keep in touch with previous co-workers, especially during a time like this.  EOS 6 0 15 Yes, I do have the numbers of a few of them. I talked to them a little during the day but I mainly kept to myself as I planned my next few steps  EOS 6 0 16 I was just ashamed for having left after they have been so helpful  EOS 6 0 17 I pride myself in being loyal and supportive but it was just too much risk to myself and family  EOS 6 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that completely, but I know you can make it through this!  EOS 6 0 19 I appreciate it lol I didn't imagine myself getting help through a platform through this, but I appreciate the support.  EOS 6 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about looking for some work from home for the time being? There are a lot of companies who are offering remote work during this time.  EOS 6 1 21 [Others] It was my pleasure!  EOS 6 0 22 I know I'll get over it. It's just an unexpected change  EOS 6 0 23 I am. I'm looking at a few options and retooling. I planned on starting university again in Fall 2021 to retool  EOS 6 1 24 [Others] Yes it is!  EOS 6 0 25 2020 has been nothing but craziness lol  EOS 6 1 26 [Others] School will definitely help.  EOS 6 0 27 For sure, I look forward to the change. I'm just planning out my next few months and a routine to help pass time.  EOS 6 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] Routines are definitely helpful, I make sure to spend plenty of time doing other hobbies I enjoy to take my mind off of the pandemic.  EOS 6 0 29 Yeah, I was pulling some old textbooks to review but I'm looking for some hobbies like art and reading  EOS 6 0 30 I found unexpected freetime so that's a blessing I guess aha  EOS 6 1 31 [Self-disclosure] I find myself watching a lot of movies and tv shows I enjoy as well as playing video games.  EOS 6 0 32 Same, I started picking up alot of old hobbies and games after the pandemic started.  EOS 6 0 33 I used to want to be hyperproductive all the time but now I am enjoying the time I do have  EOS 6 1 34 [Self-disclosure] I have done the same.  EOS 6 0 35 The burn out is real. I appreciate the time you spent listening  EOS 6 0 36 I did not know what to expect but I do feel better talking to someone anonymous than someone I know right now aha  EOS 6 1 37 [Others] It was not a problem! If you ever need anything else, don't be afraid to reach out again! 
[reference_response]	it was not a problem! if you ever need anything else, don't be afraid to reach out again!
[hypothesis_response]	i can understand that. i also have found that when i start doing things that i feel a bit more motivated, i tend to find myself more confident and more motivated to be productive.

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hello there. In the past 3 years, I have gotten into 2 car accidents. Neither of them were my fault. I sustained a concussion/traumatic brain injury and am experiencing depression and PTSD.  EOS 4 0 1 I have nightmares of crashing at least 2x a week. I am seeing a therapist, but due to the pandemic we are not meeting in person to do EDMR for my PTSD  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Hello, I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds like an awful lot to go through in a few years time, which now can feel like the time passes so quickly.  EOS 4 0 3 I have a traumatic brain injury that creates a lot of overstimulation in my life. I used to be social and now I can't be in a social setting for too long without feeling exhausted  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Have you tried to talk to your therapist through video chat or is that something they offer?  EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I talk to my therapist every other week  EOS 4 1 6 [Others] That's great that they can offer that, I know it's very difficult to get regular care at the moment with the pandemic.  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Do you have any family or friends close by or something that you can talk to if you feel like you need some extra support?  EOS 4 0 8 I do not have supportive or understanding friends and family  EOS 4 0 9 I have lost a lot of them in the last few years or have created boundaries because when I got into my first car accident, legit someone said "are you not better yet?" and another said "can't you just walk it off?"  EOS 4 0 10 When I got into my second car accident, people said "again? are you drunk?"  EOS 4 0 11 Even though neither were my fault, people were not understanding or asked how scary those situations for me were  EOS 4 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that, people are very quick to judge so it's very unfortunate that you were treated that way.  EOS 4 0 13 After my first car accident, the tow truck guy was towing my car to my aunt's garage to hold for auto insurance appraisal. He said to my aunt "sorry for your loss" My aunt said "oh, she's right over there and alive"  EOS 4 0 14 the car accident was so bad the tow truck guy thought I had died  EOS 4 0 15 but even after seeing my car, friends and family acted like it was just something that happens to everyone. walk it off  EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow, I can't imagine what the car must have looked like then for such a comment to be made. I'm glad that you here and despite going through that trauma that you are still going.  EOS 4 0 17 Thanks.  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] A women fell asleep at the wheel in 2013 and hit me going through an intersection and totaled by car as well, but I had only had a concussion and pain I had to go to physical therapy for a short time, so I can't imagine how you must have felt.

EOS 1 0 11 Yeah, and we have been together since high school so it is really hard to think of ever marrying anyone else. He asked me to marry him but we never made it official or got rings.  EOS 1 1 12 [Question] if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak  EOS 1 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart  EOS 1 0 14 He told me he never wants kids with me but acts like he would have them someday, somehow? I think you're right.  EOS 1 1 15 [Self-disclosure] i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter  EOS 1 1 16 [Information] trust me, its not worth it in the long run  EOS 1 1 17 [Question] maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you!  EOS 1 0 18 Noway! That is my worst nightmare, I am so sorry. That is a real eye opener for me/ That is exactly what I don't think I could handle. I just am in the worst cycle ever and don't have any friends to turn to or anybody who wants to listen to the drama.  EOS 1 0 19 I think I have wasted a lot of my life and I can't ever get the time back that I have invested in him.  EOS 1 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i think a lot of couples are feeling stuck with covid. once things open up and everyone is vaccinated and get togethers happen again, i bet there will be a LOT more breakups and a lot more options out there!  EOS 1 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] all we can do is learn from our mistakes and not let the past repeat itself  EOS 1 0 22 Yeah, I can see your point. It is nice being able to vent to you and feel like I am being heard. I never got that in my relationship with him. I need to learn from the past this time and stop repeating it.  EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] with your newly aquired free time, you can focus on you! start a new hobby, dye your hair,do something you always wanted to do!

EOS 0 0 3 I had the job for 14 months and I drank a lot before bed which was usually about 1 am. The job was second shift. The drinking affected my REM sleep and I was often tired the next day.  EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can understand that...  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Did you lose your job because of this?

EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It must be hard for you to prepare for it. I can understand. But there must be a way  EOS 0 0 6 I’m sure I can figure something out. I’ll definitely have to study all weekend. I just really need to pass. Do you know any good tricks to help study?  EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I can easily see your seriousness and dedication for your studies. That is awesome thing  EOS 0 0 8 Thanks! Education is very important in my family. My dad was a teacher so I’ve always had to live up to high expectations.  EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] you should take a complete rest for 2-3 hours without worrying and then get up and eat something tasty and healthy. Afterwards sit for preparing for your exam. That's what I do and it helps me a lot.  EOS 0 0 10 I love that idea! I think I’ll feel much better if I take that time to just relax before I really start working.  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] There is a famous quote " Worry is a total waste of time. It doesn't change anything. All it does is steal your joy and keep you busy doing nothing."  EOS 0 0 12 Whoever said that sure knew what they were talking about. It’s so true!  EOS 0 0 13 Any snack recommendations? I’ve got some fruit on hand, but it’s a little boring by itself lol  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] I definitely recommend trail mix or chex mix and one of my favorites is banana chips!  EOS 0 0 15 I don’t think I’ve ever tried banana chips! I’ll have to see if my grocery store has got them. Maybe I can get some delivered by the time I’m ready to study  EOS 0 1 16 [Others] you can find it in any grocery store easily known as Plantain chips

[contxt]	4 0 2 pretty depressed all in all. I dont know how to get out of this slump  EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that. How long have you been in a slump?  EOS 4 0 4 Quite a while, of course it really got worse once the pandemic hit  EOS 4 0 5 I am in a pretty bad marriage he is not supportive in any way. It's getting worse instead of better.  EOS 4 0 6 I suppose I used to be able to distract myself with the outside world and right now I cant  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand that. It's been hard on a lot of people. Sometimes marriages need a bit of help during tough times, have you considered a counselor?  EOS 4 0 8 I have tried, he won't go again. We have before and it didn't really help. He argued with her  EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] My husband and I have gone a few times and it really helped having an objective person give us a few tips. We learned a lot even in just a few short months. We set goals, achieved them and then years passed and went again.  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] That's too bad that he won't go again. I would still go for yourself. I have gone by myself because I needed extra help. And it's hard to deal with someone who doesn't want to grow and change.  EOS 4 0 11 I am happy it worked for you :) I just dont see it working with us. Hes pretty stubborn. I also struggle with a severe auto immune disorder so that is always weighing on me as well  EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I had an auto immune disorder too, actually, the counseling helped that a lot. Emotions have a way of wreaking havoc on our bodies. And it sounds like life has been stressful for you lately.  EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] Having a physical problem is really hard to deal with in addition to problems in marriage. Do you have any goals set?  EOS 4 0 14 Yes, stress is terrible for chronic illness. I had goals to get back in check with myself, I've been worried about everyone else for so long and not really about me. The pandemic haulted a lot of that. I used to take rides and go out and enjoy nature or something simple by myself to rejuvinate but it's harder now being worried to be around people. I also have an 8 and 1 year old. While they are my world, it's taxing having littles depend on you 24/7 without a breather :)  EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you have a full plate with the little one. I know a lot of people are fearful now, but rest assured, children are really resilient to disease. The CDC has not even one record of a healthy child dying. Can you still go to the park and let them run and play? I think it's healthier to be around people then to isolate. That's my personal observation. It's really taking a toll on all of us emotionally to be distant.  EOS 4 1 16 [Others] little ones . . .  EOS 4 0 17 For a few months I eased up and let them play at the park, but we live in MI which is having another huge spike, especially our county. Thank goodness we have a pretty large yard for them to run and play in but I also know its not the same  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] One thing that comes to mind about your marriage is how I continued to work on myself, and surprisingly, some of the changes I made in myself helped my husband change. For example. I realized I didn't speak respectfully to him all the time. So I changed my tone. Sometimes I didn't FEEL respectful, but I read this book explaining how men really need that. So I changed me. And you know what, he really responded well to that. Became more kind and loving. I prayed a lot and that is one thing God showed me. I read a few books on what men were like and how I could help my marriage. My husband often oblivious, but when I worked on me and doing things that men like, he actually became a better man. Hard to explain.

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hello  EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing today?  EOS 4 0 2 I have had better days.  EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Would you like to talk about it?  EOS 4 0 4 I could use someone to talk to.  EOS 4 1 5 [Others] I would love to listen. Where would you like to start?  EOS 4 0 6 I’ve been feeling down since I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years.  EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I'm so sorry to hear that. Breakups are never an easy thing. I've also gone through those and they can make you feel awful.  EOS 4 0 8 I’m just trying to pick up the pieces and look to be positive.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's an excellent place to start. It's hard but I believe that you can do it.  EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have any family or friends that you've been speaking to about this?  EOS 4 0 11 Thanks for the encouragement. That means a lot.  EOS 4 0 12 Any suggestions on how I can get my mind off of it?  EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have any hobbies? I found that refocusing my energy into something I love doing really helped to bring my mood up.  EOS 4 0 14 Great advice. I think I’m going to start up taking yoga again and catch up on some books I’ve been wanting to read.  EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Yoga is an amazing stress reliever. I practice myself! I like your game plan and I think you'll start feeling the results sooner than you think.  EOS 4 0 16 I think I’m going to lay low on dating for a while.  EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I completely understand. You'll know when you're ready again and it's great to take things at your own pace. All that matters is to do things when you're ready to.  EOS 4 0 18 How long do you think I should take a break for?  EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] Honestly, that will end up being up to you. With my last big breakup, I didn't date for almost a year until I met someone. I would suggest at least a month or so to take some time for yourself and focus on yourself and what makes you happy so when you are ready to date again, you have a stronger sense of self.  EOS 4 0 20 Thanks. That is great advice. I wouldn’t want to go into something just for the sake of dating.  EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] Agreed. Taking the breather definitely helps. 
[reference_response]	agreed. taking the breather definitely helps.
[hypothesis_response]	i'd suggest taking some time to yourself and focusing on yourself, you'd have a strong sense of confidence and your self. it will help you to focus on the things that make you happy.

[contxt]	3 0 2 I'm ok  EOS 3 0 3 how are you  EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I'm doing well, thanks. Why are you only doing okay, and not great?  EOS 3 0 5 I'm going through some things at the moment  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Many people are at this time. Is there anything in particular that is bothering you?  EOS 3 0 7 I've been feeling a lot of self doubt lately.  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Me too, winter can be rough.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Do the people around you value your work?  EOS 3 0 10 Tell me about it/  EOS 3 0 11 I'd say so, yes.  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes I get seasonal depression during winter, I'd say it's relatively common.  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] If they value your work, then you must be objectively doing okay. Maybe you shouldn't be so hard on yourself.  EOS 3 0 14 Yep, SAD is not fun. For me it's year-round though  EOS 3 0 15 Maybe. I push myself a lot to the point where it is detrimental at times.  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried exercise? Research shows it can help with depression. Depression can be caused by atrophy of certain brain regions... Getting the blood flowing can help.  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] Exercise probably will help self-esteem too.  EOS 3 0 18 Unfortunately the cycle feeds itself. Depressed, can't get out of bed, not exercising, more depressed, etc.  EOS 3 0 19 Good advice and I am trying to get back into it. Thanks  EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Yes, putting on your shows is often the hardest part.  EOS 3 0 21 you said it.  EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] shoes*  EOS 3 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] With proper health, things grow better in time, like a plant.  EOS 3 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] we're only human, lol.  EOS 3 0 25 I like that saying, thanks. although the irony of saying we're only human while comparing to a plant is kinda funny.  EOS 3 0 26 goodbye. thanks for the chat.  EOS 3 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I used to garden and was surprised how specific the nutrient needs and care are for each type of plant needs in its specific way.

[contxt]	4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh wow I am sorry to hear that - it is a bad time to be out of work isn't it?  EOS 4 0 3 yes it is a horrible time. I dont know what to do and i dont have a lot of support and my rent is due for over 2 months  EOS 4 1 4 [Information] There are organisations out there who can help due to the exceptional circumstances .. do you have anyone helping you?  EOS 4 0 5 i dont have anyone helping me and i am new to this city so i dont know who to turn to  EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Hmm, could you google for local organisations such as Citizen's Advice? I have found them very useful personally.  EOS 4 0 7 i have neve rheard of them but i will google them up  EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] They provided me with loads of helpful advice and other people to get in touch with. Also, have you considered using a food bank?  EOS 4 0 9 i did look up food bank, but there is none located where i live but i might be able to drive to the nearest one outside the city  EOS 4 1 10 [Information] There are religious organisations that can sometimes help too and would not expect you to be of their religion.  EOS 4 0 11 that sounds super helpful. I can check them out as well. I also dont know if iam applying to the right jobs. It makes me so sad to be rejected every week  EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to worry about it - it is not just you. The job market is awful right now but it will pick up again!  EOS 4 0 13 what else can you recommend  EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Are you eligible for unemployment benefits?  EOS 4 0 15 no because I didnt lose my job coz of covid.  EOS 4 0 16 is there anything else i can apply for  EOS 4 1 17 [Information] But surely you should be eligible anyway, unless you just walked out  EOS 4 0 18 I have chronic health issues so i was let go  EOS 4 0 19 do you have any other suggestions  EOS 4 1 20 [Information] Wow that is really not fair of them! I think you have grounds for legal action there  EOS 4 0 21 i actually am considering that  EOS 4 1 22 [Others] You really should - nobody has the right to dismiss you due to your health problems, that is totally outrageous.  EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I realise the prospect of legal action can be daunting and potentially expensive but you should be able to get legal aid and it sounds as though you really have been badly treated here.  EOS 4 0 24 how can start this priocess of a law suit  EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] You'd need to get legal aid. Try and find a solicitor who works pro bono.  EOS 4 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Anyway I hope that I have been able to give you some help and guidance and that things look up for you in the very near future! Try to hang in there.  EOS 4 0 27 i will try that. you have been super helpful . i will also google the location of food baank todaY  EOS 4 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's great ..

[contxt]	3 0 1 i feel depressed  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i'm sorry to hear that. is there a specific reason you are having these feelings?  EOS 3 0 3 i feel alone. i feel like i do not have any one to talk to when it comes to my emotions.  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been feeling quite lonely too, I find myself feeling lonely at work and struggling to find someone I trust to talk to about these emotions. Do you have a friend or family member that you trust who might understand some of these feelings?  EOS 3 0 5 i do have a few friends that i think i can talk to about how i am feeling however the thought of them being too busy with their work is what prevents me from reaching out to them.  EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand. Correct me if i'm wrong, it sounds like you're nervous to open up to these trusted people because you think they might be distracted by their work to provide the empathy you need and fully understand how you are feeling. Does that sound right?  EOS 3 0 7 you know i think that you are right about this. it has always been difficult for me to open to others even with those that have been there for me when i needed someone. i feel like a mix of emotions nervous but at the same time wanting to reaching out for help  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I understand these feelings very well. Sometimes, my fear overshadows my want for help. I find it easier to open up to others through writing rather than face to face. Have you considered putting your feelings in writing and opening up to trusted friends and family in this way?  EOS 3 0 9 i have been writing for a while but due to my emotions i have stopped writing like i used to. when i did write i did notice a change in my feelings it became more positive and less depressed. now that i stopped writing its like i went back into depression  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It sounds like writing your feelings down helped you greatly in the past. May I suggest going back to writing and even letting someone you trust read what you have written down to understand how you are feeling?  EOS 3 0 11 yes writing has been a huge help for me. i would take your suggestion and begin writing again to feel better. and i have let others read what i wrote and they have said it has helped them get over their depression and helped them understand me more  EOS 3 1 12 [Question] That's great! I am glad to hear that you will begin writing again. Thank you for opening up to me about your feelings. How do you feel about the solution we have come to today?  EOS 3 0 13 now that i was able to talk about how i feel with you and you giving me a useful suggestion i feel less depressed and feel motivated to write again. your help has been really helpful for me  EOS 3 1 14 [Question] That's wonderful! I appreciate your honesty about how you are feeling. I am proud of you for seeking help. Is there anything else you would like to discuss?

EOS 3 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, so you are usually a pretty decent student? I'm sorry to here that you are experiencing this  EOS 3 0 4 I was up until this pandemic started. I feel like this shift to online learning has really taken it's toll on me and my learning.  EOS 3 0 5 I've tried reaching out to my professors and doing virtual group study sessions with my class mates, but for some reason, things just don't seem to stick that well.  EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You know, a lot of students are really struggling with this new learning style, so it's very understandable  EOS 3 0 7 Really? I feel like everyone around me is doing fine and that makes me feel that there is something wrong with me.  EOS 3 0 8 Maybe I'm just slow?

I feel so lonely.  EOS 4 1 4 [Others] Have you tried to reach out to your friends for coffee, food or beer?  EOS 4 0 5 No. I fear that I might get turned down. They are usually the ones that ask me out, and they haven't been doing that for weeks.  EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Perhaps you should give it a shot and see what happens. They maybe feeling the you are the one not reciprocating and this whole thing has just been a miscommunication  EOS 4 0 7 You are saying that I have perhaps missinterpreted the whole situation?  EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] perhaps. You said that you have not reached out to your friends, so they could just be waiting.  EOS 4 0 9 But wouldn't them call me if they were at least slightly interested?  EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand your concern, but I would suggest that all relationships are a balancing act and perhaps cannot be one sided.  EOS 4 0 11 You know what, yeah, perhaps I just need to put a little more from my part this one time.  EOS 4 0 12 Do you think I should call my closest friend then?  EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I think that is a good start. If they are your closet friend you should be able to talk about this too them.  EOS 4 0 14 Yeah, I feel really comfortable talking to her. I can be open about my concerns regarding other friends too.  EOS 4 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] This sounds like a good friend.

[contxt]	3 0 0 Hello  EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you today?  EOS 3 0 2 I'm a bit bad honestly.  EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Can you tell me what's going on to cause you to feel this way?  EOS 3 0 4 I've been struggling with depression for a while. It's hard to deal with. I feel hopeless.  EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. I definitely understand how long bouts of depression can make you feel more hopeless. Have you discussed your depression with anyone else before?  EOS 3 0 6 I've spoken to a therapist but it didn't help. I tried a help hotline online but they thought I was suicidal so they called the cops to check on me .. never doing that again lol.  EOS 3 0 7 I don't know what to do  EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Yeah, it sounds like you aren't suicidal. Though I do have to check; have you had any thoughts or tendencies of suicide or self-harm?  EOS 3 0 9 I have in the past. Recently, no.  EOS 3 0 10 I just feel like I'll never be happy.  EOS 3 1 11 [Question] I understand. Can you provide any more information about your meeting with the therapist? You said talking to one didn't help, do you know why?  EOS 3 0 12 I think it didn't help because I'm a bit shy. Or because I didn't know where to start. It's hard to know what to talk about.  EOS 3 0 13 I guess it also didn't help because she seemed like she was just reading a script. She wasn't the greatest at making me feel cared about  EOS 3 0 14 You're doing pretty good though haha  EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That makes sense and is completely natural. It's difficult sometimes to open up to a stranger that you don't completely know or might not trust. It definitely sounds frustrating that she seemed like she was reading from a script.  EOS 3 1 16 [Others] And I'm glad to hear you think I'm doing alright lol  EOS 3 0 17 I think therapy could work. Actually something happened with my therapist (maybe fired lol) and she's no longer my therapist.. so I need a new one.  EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] That's interesting. I know from experience that finding a good therapist is all about trial and error, unfortunately. It's important to find the right fit and I would definitely suggest looking for a new one. Do you know of anyone in your life, maybe a friend or family member, that has been to therapy that you would be comfortable getting a recommendation from?  EOS 3 0 19 I think my closest friend has been to therapy. I could always ask her for a recommendation.  EOS 3 1 20 [Information] That sounds like a great idea! Remember to keep your friends close too. I know it can be tough when you feel as low as this, but it's important to have a good support system in addition to any therapy you might be receiving.  EOS 3 0 21 My friends and I look out for eachother. I think they're a good help :)  EOS 3 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's great to hear! It really sounds like you can go to them for support and often being there for someone else can make us feel better too. 
[reference_response]	that's great to hear! it really sounds like you can go to them for support and often being there for someone else can make us feel better too.
[hypothesis_response]	i'd definitely try to talk to a professional first to see if they can help you.

EOS 0 0 2 I'm really anxious and I javen  EOS 0 0 3 haven't been sleeping lately  EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have a lot on your mind and you are losing sleep over it?  EOS 0 0 5 Yeah my company laid off 10% of the workforce last Friday and furloughed another 10%. I'm afraid I'm next  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. It can be a bit stressful to think you may lose your job.  EOS 0 0 7 yeah my mind is racing and I can't stay calm.  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I have found there are ways to calm myself down when things in my life seem very uncertain.  EOS 0 0 9 Really? What seems to work? I'm willing to try anything right now  EOS 0 1 10 [Others] I make a list of the things I can do - And the things I can't. Then you can have goals. And if you can work on a goal, for example, if you need to write a resume, you start working on that a little bit every day until it's done. But if there is nothing you CAN do about the situation, you have to pray to God to help you then LET IT GO. If you can NOT fix it now, you will only make yourself sick thinking about it.  EOS 0 0 11 I know. I can't seem to shut my mind down.  EOS 0 0 12 And not getting sleep doesn't help  EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is much more difficult for me to remain focused and positive when I lose sleep. I have had to focus on self care, finding a friend to talk about my problems with, not someone who will TELL me what to do, but support me. So you need a good support system. And I find things like prayer, Bible reading, nice soft sheets to sleep on and some herbal tea like Sleepy Time help me relax before bedtime.

EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I would be happy to listen and help if I can :)  EOS 6 1 4 [Question] When did you notice you had a problem with alcohol?  EOS 6 0 5 The thing is I am drinking beer almost every day since I started to work from home. And with weather so nice in upcoming weeks I can't see myself stop drinking.  EOS 6 1 6 [Question] How many beer a day do you typically drink?  EOS 6 0 7 At least 4 pints. A lot of money goes on drinks as well.  EOS 6 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. So if I understand correctly, you are concerned because you are drinking more than you used to, more frequently, and you are afraid you cannot stop? And it's affecting you financially?  EOS 6 0 9 Yes, that's right. And I know I should stop but I just got addicted.  EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's really great that you have the insight to see that it may be a problem...that awareness is the most important first step!  EOS 6 0 11 Thank you for understanding  EOS 6 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I haven't experienced addictions but I have been supporting my daughter with her addiction for many years, and I have seen how challenging it's been for her.  EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] She has found AA very helpful, and gets a lot of support from her peers there. Have you tried going to an AA meeting?  EOS 6 0 14 I think I am not quite confident in going somewhere in person. I don't want other people to see my addiction problem  EOS 6 1 15 [Information] The thing about AA is everyone in the room will be understanding and nonjudgemental and supportive. And you can learn from them what has worked for them. And it's okay to sit quietly and just listen, you are not forced to participate actively.  EOS 6 1 16 [Information] And...it's anonymous! They have a code, outside meetings nobody is to disclose that you were there.  EOS 6 0 17 To be fair I am scared also to go such places. If somebody from work will see me I would get in real trouble as I am working from home and drinking.  EOS 6 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that being scary, keeping your job is essential.  EOS 6 1 19 [Question] Whereabouts are you? (I'm in CAnada)  EOS 6 0 20 I am in UK.  EOS 6 0 21 Maybe you know some online courses you are aware of?  EOS 6 1 22 [Information] Oh!! I just remembered. My daughter goes to meetings virtually because of the pandemic. I am pretty sure there would also be virtual AA meetings in the UK, via Zoom  EOS 6 0 23 Oh that's great I will try then. Do you know if there are any fees?  EOS 6 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] Hmm I am afraid I don't, have you tried a google search? That's a great idea, to find an online program of some sort, if AA does not appeal to you. And no, there are no fees, AA is completely free.  EOS 6 1 25 [Information] And, you can get a sponsor, do you know about that?  EOS 6 0 26 What do you mean by a sponsor?  EOS 6 1 27 [Information] My daughter has a sponsor, it's an important part of AA (and optional). Her sponsor has been clean for over 20 years.

Can you tell me a bit about these known unknowns?  EOS 0 0 4 I work for cruise industry and it's been a bit tough since whole COVID situation started.  EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah man, thats pretty unlucky isn't it, I'm in the same situation, but I think yours is a bit worse.  EOS 0 0 6 Yes, I'm just always worried that I can loose my job.  EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, I feel you there on the anxiety, you'll definitely get through this.  EOS 0 0 8 It's just constantly to many unknowns, and it feels like it's not even getting better.  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Thats what anxiety is all about, the best you can do is figure out how to address those unknowns.  EOS 0 0 10 But how do I address them, how would I deal with this?  EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I lost my job, started coding, doing odd-jobs, and learning survival skills. That is how I prepared for my unknowns.

How are you today?  EOS 3 0 4 I'm feeling a little bit down today. I've been feeling a little bit down a lot lately.  EOS 3 1 5 [Information] Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately?  EOS 3 0 6 My ex-husband is moved in with his new girlfriend. They might get married.  EOS 3 1 7 [Information] Oh Keri, that must feel awful. Was it a recent separation between you two?  EOS 3 0 8 He started dating a few months after we split up. I don't know if this is the only person he's dated but I think so. He really moved on quick.  EOS 3 0 9 Hi, are you still there?  EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yeah I understand what you're going through. I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he's trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours?  EOS 3 0 11 It makes me feel like he didn't learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he's better than me because he has someone new and I don't. I'm trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won't ever find anyone.  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you're doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another.

[contxt]	2 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how can I help you today?  EOS 2 0 2 My friend has been quiet and non responsive for some time and I'm starting to worry about them. This is a pretty recent thing, ever since lockdown.  EOS 2 1 3 [Question] Is this a close friend of yours that you would normally speak to every day or see on a regular basis?  EOS 2 0 4 Yes that's correct, however with lockdown I haven't seen any friends for a long time face to face.  EOS 2 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have are close friend, who you used to engage with regularly and now you are worried because when you try and contact them, they aren't responding.  EOS 2 0 6 Yes that's the issue. I think lockdown is affecting people in many ways and I want to make sure they are OK  EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you feel a lot for your friend and it shows that you care about lot about them.  EOS 2 0 8 Yes I do. Now what should I do about them as other friends in our peer group are also concerned?  EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Ok, I understand. Have you tried reaching out to their family members as they may have a loser handle on how this person is feeling at the moment?  EOS 2 0 10 I actually haven't. I'm not that close to their family to be honest so I'm not quite sure how to do that?  EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] You could try reaching out to friends on Facebook or social media, you can find contact details for them that way and perhaps send them a direct message. You are a concerned friend which means they probably wouldn't mind if you did get in touch.  EOS 2 0 12 I didn't think about contacting family that way. That's a good suggestion.  EOS 2 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I had a friend once that was acting out of character. They weren't quiet but I could tell them here was something different in the way they were acting etc. It turns out that they had started a new relationship with another friend of mine and didn't want anyone else to know. In reality everything was fine. There was an explainable reason behind the behaviour and it was nothing bad in the end.  EOS 2 0 14 Perhaps I am worried about nothing and your experience does make sense. I may be reading too much into these things but you read about people's mental health being affected by COVID isolation these days.  EOS 2 1 15 [Information] That is true. Mental health issues have increased significantly since lockdowns began  EOS 2 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] As they are not responding to your attempts to get in touch, you could think has anything else changed for them other than lockdown, for example are they busier at work? have childcare commitments? Life is complicated, they may not have the time for legitimate reasons.  EOS 2 0 17 That is true. I think they are probably very busy at the moment but as they are typically so outgoing it did strike me as odd. What else would you suggest?  EOS 2 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] You mentioned that other friends were also concerned about them, have you tried talking to them about setting up a video call with a group. This might appeal to your friend and they may see this as a fun activity to get involved in. 
[reference_response]	you mentioned that other friends were also concerned about them, have you tried talking to them about setting up a video call with a group. this might appeal to your friend and they may see this as a fun activity to get involved in.
[hypothesis_response]	i think that you are looking for someone who is willing to spend time with you. that might help a lot.

EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I can sense that this is bothering you a lot not knowing why your friend is making excuses. This is making you feel ignored.

EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I am assuming that you and your friend are very close and have been friends for a long time.

[contxt]	3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So sorry to hear about your plight. Life is a roller coaster and sometimes it gets out of control, I hope things slow down so you can get things straightened out.  EOS 3 0 5 thank you! I find myself so stressed then I get scared and depressed wondering what will the future hold will we be ok will we take another hit will I get sick will my Mother be ok  EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand your concerns about being stressed, scared and depressed. The risk of family getting sick is certainly valid.  EOS 3 0 7 it keeps me up at night and I cant seem to get away form it even for a moment  EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I too worry about things I feel I cannot control, the lack of sleep due to this just makes it worse so I try to think of positive things, but its hard.  EOS 3 0 9 yes and its always in the back of my mind burning. Like don't be to happy because things are going to fail  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Its hard to stop those negative thoughts, but the first step is sharing your feelings with others and talking about it. You are now on your way to healing.  EOS 3 0 11 It does help to talk about it with someone who doesn't judge  EOS 3 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I can see in your words how stressed you are and troubled.  EOS 3 0 13 This whole covid thing makes it 10 times worse  EOS 3 1 14 [Information] May I suggest that you seek some face to face support from a best friend or close family member.  EOS 3 0 15 easier said then done I'm high risk so I have been social distancing  EOS 3 1 16 [Information] Its still possible. Social distancing, six feet away but in maybe your backyard or even a park away from others so you can talk with some degree of confidence that its private. Just being around another person is so very supportive and positive. Please try.  EOS 3 0 17 maybe but I need to be carful plus honest I dont want many people to know about my feelings  EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] True. Remember, you are not the only one facing these troubles, others are tackling it too. Try also to google online support groups on Reddit and blogs for additional assistance and suggestions from those who faced it and succeeded. Doing what others did to overcome it means not having to reinvent the whole process on your own.  EOS 3 0 19 maybe an online chat group  EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's the way to go. Keep seeking help. The right solution is there for you. Now you have a plan to get started.  EOS 3 0 21 well I don't know if its a plan but an idea just knowing I'm not alone helps  EOS 3 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, it a problem so many people are facing.  EOS 3 1 23 [Self-disclosure] My own family members are facing this too.  EOS 3 0 24 yes I know and with covid so many are depressed stressed and sad  EOS 3 1 25 [Information] I read a few articles on Psychology today website that might help you also.

EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Mixed feelings have you been having? It's completely normal and understandable to have them.

I feel every time I reach out to the friends I do have they are too busy with their families to talk.  EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel a lot of people are in your situation especially with Covid going on. Do you connect with friends on social media at all (like facebook)?  EOS 4 0 5 Yea, I do comment on their social media and follow up with their lives there. I do not actively post about my own life because we have been extremely cautious with covid as I am high risk, so we don't even go grocery shopping. I think I am just feeling fatigued of being stuck inside, which makes me feel sad about everything else.  EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] I can totally understand where you are coming from.

I am guessing you will be in line for a vaccination also in the up coming month which I think will help your mood as well.  EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I am awaiting my turn for the vaccine and I am very much looking forward to getting it so I can get back to some normalcy. I miss being able to go shopping or sitting in a coffee shop. These activities helped me in the past, so I look forward to being able to get out and do them again. I used to visit my friends too and we'd have lunch or coffee at their house, but obviously I haven't been able to do that lately. I will be able to once I get the vaccine.  EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I was able to get my first dose of this vaccine this past Sunday. I was very surprised how good I felt this week like a weight being lifted off my shoulders. I work with high school kids so it was nice not thinking about covid all the time. I not it might not help for you today but I think it will give you something to look forward as you move forward in the upcoming weeks.  EOS 4 1 9 [Others] *I know  EOS 4 0 10 That's so exciting for you! I am hoping I will be able to get mine in the coming weeks. I've definitely been looking forward to getting it. I decided a week ago that I would get a puppy as a companion. So I am looking forward to that, but he will not be coming home until the beginning of May. But you're right I need to look forward to the things that will bring me happiness even though it's hard right now.  EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Absolutely. The weather seems to be getting nicer as well. Do you like any outdoor activites (ex. walking outside)?  EOS 4 0 12 I love walking outside. We had a 60 degree day not too long ago and I went outside immediately to walk. My mood was better that day than it has been in months. I am definitely looking forward to spring, which is quickly approaching now! I have to say, I appreciate you pushing me in the direction of thinking positively and looking forward to the future, it's something I definitely lost my grasp on for a little while.  EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] I think you got a lot of things to be excited about and look forward to - 1. warmer weather 2. longer-daylight hours 3. vaccine upcoming - which then will open up the activities you enjoy like shopping and going out for coffee 4. Getting a puppy In the mean time, I think it helps to try to keep busy. Is there goals you can set for yourself each day? Like maybe working on a room for a puppy, to take a walk outside each day, an area of the house that should get cleaned, or start a new hobby (like finding a book you have been meaning to read)

[contxt]	3 0 0 Hello.  EOS 3 1 1 [Others] Hello  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How are you tonight?  EOS 3 0 3 Feeling depressed as usual  EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I'm sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed?  EOS 3 0 5 Everything. Life. It's awful. How many years do you really need to stop enjoying this place.  EOS 3 0 6 Ya know what I mean  EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand, but just to make sure I know what is going on fully, you are depressed in general and don't know how to get through it.  EOS 3 0 8 I would say that is fairly accurate.  EOS 3 0 9 Often times, I wish an asteroid would come down and begin the apocolypse.  EOS 3 0 10 Something to break up the routine  EOS 3 0 11 Don't you find life utterly boring and repetitive?  EOS 3 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this.  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well.  EOS 3 0 14 Sorry to hear that. Anxiety and depression are dual bladed sword of badness  EOS 3 0 15 Really bad mixture  EOS 3 0 16 I never struggled too much with anxiety.  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] It was tough. Have you thought about consulting a psychological professional to help with this issue? I did when I was going through my depression and it really helped.  EOS 3 0 18 NO! I would never do that. I'm already on anti depressants. That didn't help at all.  EOS 3 0 19 I just don't understand why people like life enough to make more people!  EOS 3 0 20 It is madness!  EOS 3 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I didn't like the meds that they gave me either, however I felt that talking to someone helped me a great deal.  EOS 3 0 22 Well, I'm glad it helped you. I'm not just saying that. Being depressed is awful.  EOS 3 0 23 What did it do for you?  EOS 3 0 24 How so?  EOS 3 1 25 [Self-disclosure] It was good to be able to talk to an objective third party about what was going on. It allowed me to get my feelings out without the threat of being judges or harrassed.  EOS 3 0 26 I understand. Well, I appreciate your time and advice. I just don't feel like you and I are understanding each other very well, though. Anyway, you made your bonus. I appreciate you trying to help me, though  EOS 3 0 27 We got to talk for another 4 minutes though  EOS 3 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things?  EOS 3 0 29 I used to have more hobbies. Now, I'm not so motivated to do much of anything anymore.  EOS 3 0 30 I used to play instruments. I like hiking a little, but it is winter now. So... I can't even do that. Plus... I have to travel really far to do that because there is nothing to hike that is very close  EOS 3 1 31 [Question] Why did you stop playing insturments?

[hypothesis_response]	that sounds difficult. i also used to hike. i enjoy outdoor activities and i used it to provide me with exercise.

[contxt]	0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I think I would start by putting your own health first and getting yourself tested to make sure that you haven't contracted anything from your fiancé. I know this will be incredibly hard, but I wouldn't want to see you getting sick and suffering as a result of his infidelity.  EOS 0 1 19 [Self-disclosure] No, we were not married. We were together for almost 7 years and engaged at one point, but I broke it off after he cheated on me. He cheated on me several times. It's the worst feeling in the world.  EOS 0 0 20 I'm scared to get tested. What if it comes back positive?  EOS 0 0 21 Was the child he had a boy or girl?  EOS 0 1 22 [Information] I would be scared, too. However, it's better to act now because to my knowledge, the sooner that you find out and treat it, the better the chances are of you treating it. There are a lot of new medications out there that can be used to treat HIV and AIDS.  EOS 0 0 23 Have you been tested for AIDS? What do they do when you get tested?  EOS 0 1 24 [Self-disclosure] I know that their first child is a girl. I'm not sure if their second is a girl or a boy. I haven't spoken to him in several years. I found out through a friend about their second child. We haven't spoken at all since I found out about the first one.  EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] I have been tested for all STDs because I was cheated on. All of mine came back negative. All they did when I got tested was bloodwork.  EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about reaching out to a therapist or counselor who could help you to work through your feelings and everything that you're dealing with?  EOS 0 0 27 Didn't you say you have a daughter by him? And you haven't talk to him since he cheated? What about your daughter feelings? She has a right to know her father doesn't she?  EOS 0 1 28 [Others] I am so incredibly sorry that you have to deal with all of this at all but especially at the start of the holiday season. My heart absolutely breaks for you.  EOS 0 1 29 [Self-disclosure] Yes, we have a daughter. He spent the first eight years of her life in prison. I gave her the choice as to whether or not she wanted to get to know him. He had plenty of opportunities to speak to her and chose not to call or show up when he was supposed to. The last thing she said about him was, "All he does is lie to me and break promises. I don't want to see him or talk to him anymore."  EOS 0 0 30 And no I haven't thought or going to therapy. I'm not the one who cheated on anyone and this just happened Friday. I didn't know where to start. So I called here  EOS 0 0 31 Are you or your daughter in therapy?  EOS 0 1 32 [Self-disclosure] I'm a great mother and I always put my daughter's feelings first. She made the decision not to see or speak to her father. Him and my now ex-best friend are on drugs and don't have custody of their own children. It's in my daughter's best interest that she doesn't know him.

She was fine Thursday when I last saw her. The sister also told me the doctors said she could die at any moment because she has advance Kidney failure. She also told me I need to get tested because her sister told her she and my fiance has been having an affair. I didn't believe her or the whole situation so I confronted my fiance.

[contxt]	4 0 0 hello  EOS 4 0 1 i am so worried about my daughter  EOS 4 1 2 [Others] Hello  EOS 4 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear.  EOS 4 0 4 she has addictions and is living a very dangerous life  EOS 4 0 5 which makes me sad and anxious and angry all at once  EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is nerve wrecking. Did you try to comfort her and tell her that you are there to help her out.  EOS 4 0 7 yes, often  EOS 4 0 8 but she won't go for help, so i have had to be exceedingly patient  EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I love your patience level and would like to keep it going.  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Patience is the key and she will understand eventually. She will be ready to take help.  EOS 4 0 11 i will but it's such a heavy burden to carry. i try not to think about it much, but I carry it, you know? I Hope you are right about her wanting help eventually  EOS 4 0 12 in the meantime I don't know how to be so sad about this, maybe there is no way  EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] I understand your heavy burden however some kids face these problems and we as parents guide them so that they come out with flying colors.  EOS 4 0 14 indeed. and i have been holding up my end of the bargain. but it's so worrisome.  EOS 4 0 15 it sounds like you are encouraging me to have hope against all odds?  EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] You are a warrior and you need to fight off the worrisome and motivate yourself to help you kiddo.  EOS 4 0 17 CAn't help someone who doesn't want help though, but I do try to be there for her as best i can. She calls me up with terrible stories and I listen even though it pains me, because she needs someone to listen.  EOS 4 0 18 Addiction is an affliction I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy now that I have seen her living it  EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] Wow that is a good sign atleast she is coming to you to vent out. That is were you need to punch in an opportunity to seek help from a professional and convince her in such a way she will come down and accept it.  EOS 4 0 20 I have encouraged her to set up appointments with professionals. Sometimes she has, but does not follow through, the addiction gets in the way, it's more powerful than her desire to stop. And I can't just drive her/ accompany her to an appointment because she lives in a different city  EOS 4 0 21 But yes, I am happy she trusts me enough to confide in me  EOS 4 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] You have such a good heart so hang in there she will come to you with a bang.  EOS 4 0 23 i really appreciate your encouragement  EOS 4 0 24 i have been feeling worn down by it and your encouragement helps  EOS 4 0 25 have you any other suggestions for me?  EOS 4 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] Is there any way you could move to her city for a while and help her out. If so she will not skip any appointment and it will help her way. 
[reference_response]	is there any way you could move to her city for a while and help her out. if so she will not skip any appointment and it will help her way.

EOS 3 0 12 Can you elaborate on extensions please ? Not sure what it is ?  EOS 3 1 13 [Others] Also there are people willing to help sometimes in local places.

EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Yes it is nice. Are you doing anything festive today?  EOS 0 0 8 No, nothing much. Same as always, on and off work, having a meal with the girlfriend, that sort. (It would help if this system shows us if one of us is typing..)  EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that times are rough lately. Sounds like there is some time to figure it out, take full advantage of all the time you can. I hope it works out and a new position becomes available, I know your story is shared by many right now. What a crazy time we are in  EOS 0 1 10 [Others] yes it does, on top it says inputing  EOS 0 0 11 Ah fair, that's good to know  EOS 0 0 12 Yes, still it doesn't quite help that no matter how many CVs you submit, hit rates for jobs just don't go up.  EOS 0 1 13 [Others] what are cv's? I see, I am getting by by dping a billion a day lol  EOS 0 1 14 [Question] but there is other income, im not sure it would support me otherwise. Are there other lines of work you could look into?  EOS 0 0 15 I get what you mean about other lines of work. I'm trained as an academic research associate and had to spend a few months last year working in an Amazon warehouse. I feel like I've wasted enough time outside of aimed-for career to go back to doing manual labour.  EOS 0 0 16 *this year even..  EOS 0 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] well the title sounds legit, lol, but yes i see and understand. Did you do the trainging in the warehouse for the research job?  EOS 0 0 18 No, completely unrelated jobs. It was more of a "really need a job right now" situation, and they were hiring quite unassumingly.  EOS 0 1 19 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh i see.  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] If this odd job tasks site exists maybe there a more related oppurtunites to get into that pay more. Or really, the green field is a good one to get into right now I think like solar companies and such. They are going to become more prevalent soon.  EOS 0 0 21 Are you working in such a role? I doubt my qualifications translate THAT well haha  EOS 0 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I make a good case right so you might think I was but no, I am not I only wish to be. I wish to be much more than I am but ya know I work with what I can find to do. Id savd the world every day if zi could knowing my efforts were toowrads a good cause.  EOS 0 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] I always tell my other half, they might just take a chance and hire out of their skill zone if you have drive and interest in the field.  EOS 0 0 24 I do like that idea. I might actually go and give that a shot and see what happens.  EOS 0 1 25 [Others] as we were told growing up the worst they could say is no,  EOS 0 0 26 True, but a lot of no's can take a toll on one's psyche  EOS 0 1 27 [Others] yes for sure dont go on like that for too long.

[contxt]	3 0 0 hi there  EOS 3 1 1 [Others] Hello! How are you doing?  EOS 3 0 2 I'm not doing so good at the moment. I'm feeling very stressed and burned out from work  EOS 3 1 3 [Information] That sounds very frustrating. Is this a recent development at your job?  EOS 3 0 4 It's been building up for a while now, but it's really starting to get a but overwhelming  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] I can understand how that can have an effect on your mental well-being. Have you spoken to your supervisor about your frustrations at work?  EOS 3 0 6 I have, but sometimes I feel like she doesn't really listen and she sort of talks over me a lot  EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you don't feel listened to.  EOS 3 0 8 That's right... I guess that is quite a lot of the problem.  EOS 3 0 9 I don't mind so much the work, I know it is busy for everyone right now, it's a combination of the workload plus not being listened to  EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I had a similar issue at my last job. My supervisor constantly spoke over me in meetings, and it would drive me crazy. I never could get a word in edge-wise.  EOS 3 0 11 Yeah, that sounds a lot like what I am experiencing  EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Are you considering switching jobs?  EOS 3 0 13 It's been in the back of my mind, but it's a hard time just now with everything else going on  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Absolutely. It's a rough time job searching under the best of circumstances.  EOS 3 0 15 It is.  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried reaching out to anyone in your network to look for a new position? It helped me when I was previously job searching.  EOS 3 0 17 I haven't, but it might be worth getting in touch with some people  EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Absolutely. I also spoke with a therapist before and it helped me a lot.  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered reaching out to a professional to talk to?  EOS 3 0 20 I did consider that, but aren't they expensive?  EOS 3 1 21 [Information] They can be, but many local governments and municipalities have therapists that work on a sliding scale if the financial aspect of therapy is a concern. 
[reference_response]	they can be, but many local governments and municipalities have therapists that work on a sliding scale if the financial aspect of therapy is a concern.
[hypothesis_response]	i have heard that they can be a bit expensive. i think the best thing is to see a therapist who can offer some support to help you, that way you can see if you can't afford it.

EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Going through a break up is never easy, especially when it is with someone you thought you would spend you life with. I understand completely. It is natural to feel sad for a while  EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I have been divorced myself so I know it is not easy. But I can promise it gets much better  EOS 4 0 8 yeah. it sucks. wish it was not this way. do not want to move on but without trust there is nothing  EOS 4 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Of course and it is normal to have mixed feelings  EOS 4 0 10 I just cannot get out of this funk. why me? what did i do to make him want someone else?  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Have you looked into any divorce support groups in your area or online? It can help to discover that you are not alone in how you feel  EOS 4 0 12 Yeah, but the only one in my area in person is cancelled. online seems impersonal. I dont mind being on my own, but like companionship. But will not trust again. I am in a no win situation. At least the kids are grown.  EOS 4 0 13 talking does help some, just no way to fix this really. It is internalized with me.  EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I went though a lot of feelings myself when I divorced. Blaming myself, blaming him, missing him. It took some time to work through but thankfully today it is all a distant memory. Sometimes time is the best healer. Be kind to yourself and take time for you.

Has the pandemic been making your financial situation worse?  EOS 0 0 5 Yes. My wife lost her job due to it and it has put a larger burden on us financially.  EOS 0 1 6 [Information] There is government help available for people who are financially suffering I believe - have you looked into this?  EOS 0 0 7 Yes, unfortunately I make too much money to qualify with my job. It still is a huge burden not having the income we depend on from my wife.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I am really sorry. Is she able to get any other sort of work, even if it's less well paid?  EOS 0 0 9 We're trying. She has a few interviews set up next week.

[contxt]	5 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's positive, though, that you at least have a strategy in mind with retirement, even if this may not be the best time right now.  EOS 5 0 9 She has a "plan", I guess, but it isn't being articulated that well, and these actions are demonstrating poor "people management" and seem to be both confusing lots of folks, and professionally insulting many others. Oh, and by the way, things are running WORSE than they were before, but it's being blamed on COVID  EOS 5 0 10 Problem with the "retirement strategy" is that it means going out on a limb with no job with the holidays coming up, and with COVID with no end in sight. SO, just "muddling through" the days these days, hoping better times are ahead.  EOS 5 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are not the only worker who is seriously questioning the changes being made.  EOS 5 0 12 Oh, no. 1 person outright quit immediately. 1 other has retired already. 1 more I know is retiring by New Years. Others are more "stuck", as they just CAN'T afford to quit OR retire. So, yeah, us "old folk" are not "happy campers"  EOS 5 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow! From what you've said, it sounds like your coworkers feel much as you do about the changes.  EOS 5 0 14 Yep. We are sort of our own "support group", but since we are all 100% teleworking these days, we don't "see" each other, though we try to touch base through phone calls at least once a week.  EOS 5 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be tough, but it must help to at least commiserate through the phone calls and be able to relate to each other.  EOS 5 0 16 Yep. Best I can hope for at this point. If I find another job to transition to, that would improve things. Until then, gotta just "keep on keeping on"  EOS 5 1 17 [Self-disclosure] My former spouse works for a company that has moved him to departments he needed to retrain to work in, and he is considering looking for a different job, maybe after COVID is outta here.  EOS 5 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you're determined to stay as positive as possible while considering other options, such as a new job. Doing something about it like this must feel a little better.  EOS 5 0 19 As good as it can. Thanks for your time and commiseration.  EOS 5 1 20 [Self-disclosure] You're welcome! I also think that's wise to hold off on retirement until your daughter is through college. My oldest is ready for college and I don't feel ready to leave work, either.  EOS 5 0 21 Yep, and she's actually a senior, so she'll graduate in May. But I gotta keep my motivation up until then. ;)  EOS 5 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can do it!  EOS 5 0 23 Thanks! I guess we'll see. Have a great evening.  EOS 5 1 24 [Others] You too! G'night.

EOS 4 0 8 4 years  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a long time. I think its normal to take time to recover after a long relationship, after all it was a significant part of your life for 4 years.

If you're not speaking, why not just forget about her?

[contxt]	3 1 3 [Question] Do you have specific things that are causing you sadness right now or is it an overall feeling of being sad?  EOS 3 0 4 It's a bit of everything. I've recently lost my job and I'm just really worried about how my bills are going to get paid. I feel so tired, you know?  EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I totally understand. Losing your job is a very rough thing to go through, I'm sorry that happened to you. Feeling constantly at red alert is taxing both mentally and physically.  EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] There is a concept called Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and sometimes I find it useful to think about if my needs are being met, and which is lacking. Which is to say, obviously financial security is your primary need at the moment, but there are other needs you must attend to as well, including your physical comforts.  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] In times of great stress and upheaval, there is only so much you can do. The rest is worry, a hamster running in a wheel, a huge output of energy that does nothing at all.  EOS 3 0 8 Yeah that makes sense but I've spent so much time thinking about my finances that I've sort of burned myself out  EOS 3 0 9 Like I have no energy even to be thankful for the other little stuff  EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] That makes sense. You sound emotionally exhausted.  EOS 3 0 11 Definitely, I feel like I could sleep forever but with my kids to worry about I don't have that option  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Gratitude is one of those things, I've found, that is self-perpetuating. Even if you begin by doing it robotically, eventually your mind and heart will want to be more sincerely grateful. I have in the past challenged myself to find five things to be grateful for in the morning and write them down. Whether those things are "I have hot coffee and electricity" or "I won $1000 for free", they will begin to start a small fire of joy.  EOS 3 0 13 Messages could work, I could stick them around and I guess they coudl help not just me but my little ones too because I'm sure my moods been affecting them as well  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a great idea! It sounds like you care a lot about your kids, I bet it's easy for you to be grateful for them :-)  EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] And I know that they are grateful for you, whether they are able to articulate that or not  EOS 3 0 16 Absolutely the little terrors are the reason I get up in the morning. I can't let them down, you know  EOS 3 0 17 Their dad's not arpund so its just us  EOS 3 0 18 I'm all they've got  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] Well that is an enormous amount of responsibility that has been placed upon your shoulders, but your attitude seems extremely pleasant and positive. It does not sound easy, but you should make sure you build in some time for yourself if you can.  EOS 3 0 20 I'm going to try, the messages idea is a really good one so I think I'll give that a try. I mean I am grateful for my kids and I guess things could be worse I do still have some savings left and I can always try to get another job  EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You definitely have options, but your situation is still tough, and you deserve relief where you can get it.

[contxt]	3 0 2 hi. i was discontinued from my studies due to some financial problem  EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a very tough situation to be in, I'm sorry you're having to deal with that.  EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Are you having to move home or were you taking online classes?  EOS 3 0 5 i am staying with my parents.  EOS 3 0 6 i am thinking of applying an online job but i am afraid that i can't manage both my studies and job  EOS 3 0 7 thinking about it makes me frustrating and sad  EOS 3 1 8 [Question] That is understandable. So you aren't having to discontinue your studies immediately?  EOS 3 0 9 i have discontinued it already  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Okay, thank you for clarifying :-) Your frustration is understandable. Having a job while being in school can be tough, that is true. However if you are discerning you could get a job that would have flexible hours, especially if you let them know beforehand that you're planning on getting back into school as soon as possible.  EOS 3 0 11 yes. thank you for concern  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] When I was in college, I worked for the school and the library. It was not a lot of money, but in addition to a small check, it made me more indispensable to the university.  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] I think you would be able to handle both, as long as you are clear from the beginning about what you need from the job. Too often we are supposed to feel like we need to beg for a job, when in fact, you are interviewing them as well.  EOS 3 0 14 i think i can also follow this idea.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] You should also explore any and all financial aid offers they can give you. More than once I have been told that not as many people apply for scholarships and grants as you think.  EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But regardless of whether you're able to balance the two things, even if you are not, your mental health is very important, and you should try to take it easy on yourself.  EOS 3 0 17 I think i can cope upwith my situation with this advice of you.thank you  EOS 3 0 18 what are you doing lately  EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You're very welcome, I think you are capable of more than you think.

[contxt]	3 0 0 Hello.  EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hell, sorry  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How are you today?  EOS 3 0 3 A little down. Kind of broke for Christmas.  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I totally understand how you feel  EOS 3 0 5 Yeah, it's pretty tough because the year went really well until the summer. I was hoping for a strong close.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] If you don't mind may I ask you a few question? Are you trying to find gigs?  EOS 3 0 7 Yes but with the pandemic, people are just doing small work themselves instead of hiring out.  EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sorry. I guess you have to change your plan so much.  EOS 3 0 9 That's what I've been doing, but it's a lot of running in place trying to generate any income.  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I meant you had to change your plan  EOS 3 0 11 Yes, and the changes I've made to the plan haven't lead to a whole lot more.  EOS 3 0 12 One of those "painted myself into a corner" situations.  EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am also looking for more gigs and because of Covid, I'm only looking online jobs  EOS 3 0 14 Like "work from home" style jobs?  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] yes just like this mturk  EOS 3 0 16 Hmm, maybe I can look into these type of jobs. I don't have a great computer but it could do for some stuff.  EOS 3 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Jobs are super competitive these days. Have you thought about becoming a YouTuber or a live streamer?  EOS 3 0 18 Yes, I've tried both of those. It's mostly luck based. You just have to hope that enough people get interested to make it work and a lot of wasted effort goes into self- promotion.  EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I believe after Covid is over more onsite jobs will be available. I hope you will be able to comfortably spend your days until then.  EOS 3 0 20 I agree with that. I just hope  EOS 3 0 21 * I can make it until then  EOS 3 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I see. I see you have made a lot of effort to get additional income. Wonderful, I believe you are a great worker when you work, whatever you do. You have passion and motivation.  EOS 3 0 23 That is true, I am a hard worker, no matter the job.  EOS 3 1 24 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would brush up my resume, make it more noticeable, change your LinkedIn profile if you have one. So that future employer will be able to find you, such a great candidate.  EOS 3 0 25 Hmmm, my resume could use some work, that is true.  EOS 3 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] About resume, one of my friends added his picture wearing a Trump tie on his resume lol . I thought it was weird but whatever it makes it noticeable could help.  EOS 3 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Or you could start your own business as you have already tried as a YouTuber. I heard a lot of people starts their own because of Covid 
[reference_response]	or you could start your own business as you have already tried as a uber. i heard a lot of people starts their own because of covid

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hello  EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello! how are you today?  EOS 4 0 2 I am not fine  EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Why is that?  EOS 4 0 4 My colleagues always talking bad about me behind  EOS 4 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see. Your colleagues talking about you has you feeling down today.  EOS 4 0 6 Yeah. It makes me very sad  EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I understand why that would be so. I have had a similar situation happen to me before.  EOS 4 0 8 How did you solve it?  EOS 4 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I totally understand why you are sad. It's very hurtful when someone talks bad about you.  EOS 4 0 10 How to solve the issue? I need a solutions  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Well I convinced myself that their opinions did not matter. Also, I confronted a few of them alone to find out why they were talking about me.  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Another thing that you can do if nothing else works is to move to another department or even another job. But before you do that try and find out what the problem is exactly. Maybe it is not as bad as you think.  EOS 4 0 13 I had asked them about it. but they does not reply me  EOS 4 0 14 I already asked them  EOS 4 1 15 [Information] In situations like this people tend to feel more powerful when they withhold information. They are more than likely very immature and insecure.  EOS 4 0 16 But they are doing many things behind me  EOS 4 1 17 [Information] That is a perfect example of immaturity. When people act like this, the person they are ostracizing makes them feel threatened in some way so they treat them badly in order to regain control and security.  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I had someone that felt very insecure because of me talk badly about me to our mutual friends and even family. What I ended up doing was to completely block the person out of my life and go on living and being me. I showed the people that that person was a jealous, insecure liar simply by being myself.

[contxt]	3 1 1 [Question] I'm sorry to hear this. Is there something specifically bothering you?  EOS 3 0 2 I just feel like no one I work with really likes me or cares about me  EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You don't think people like you or care about you at work? What specifically have they done to make you think this?  EOS 3 0 4 I just feel like no one talks to me and if I try and talk to them they are very dismissive  EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand that might make you feel uncomfortable.  EOS 3 0 6 I feel like I go out of my way to help people and I remember their birthdays and I try and be nice to them but no one ever does the same for me  EOS 3 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I have been in many work situations and even social situations where I did not feel as if I fit in, I'm rather an unusual person. I had to learn to not focus so much on BEING accepted. I had to learn what God think of me (he loves me) and try to be kind to all I meet, other centered. That is, I also had to make sure I wasn't being rude or mean.  EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand how hurtful that is. Our society isn't as kind as it once was. I find very few people appreciate kindness. However, I can't get caught up in that, it's the way people are. It isn't a reflection of myself.  EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I think it is the hardest thing to be more concerned with others than we are with ourselves, it can be lonely.  EOS 3 0 10 I think from now on I’m just going to focus on myself and my family, I’m not gonna out of my way to be nice to my coworkers, I’m just going to treat them as coworkers not as friends and just keep to myself  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I think you can be kind to them, but I think perhaps your expectations are that they reciprocate, and they aren't which hurts. Perhaps be kind without expecting anything in return, and know that God sees your kindness.  EOS 3 0 12 I always feel like you have to be a friend to have friends, but I’m tired of being the only one putting effort in and getting taken advantage of  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also had this happen, I had no friends and at first I thought it was me, then I realized it was an opportunity for personal growth. Which wasn't easy.  EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] How do you feel they take advantage?  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] Being ignored is one thing, having someone take advantage of you is a different story.  EOS 3 0 16 I just feel like they just expect me to do things for them now and when I do it, it’s no appreciated because they just know I will do it.  EOS 3 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] I understand. Yes, then they definitely are taking advantage. Have you read anything on setting boundaries and learning how to say no?  EOS 3 0 18 Yeah, I’m working on taking care of myself more than worrying about everyone else. I think the holidays make it even harder to set the boundaries  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I had learned once that it is so important to be able to easily say no because then we are free to say yes. Because if we say yes because we CAN'T say no, then we feel resentful. So If I can freely say no to you, then i am free to say yes, if that makes sense. Although for me, it was hard to say no, but it gets easier, now it is easy. It wasn't at first. 
[reference_response]	i had learned once that it is so important to be able to easily say no because then we are free to say yes. because if we say yes because we can't say no, then we feel resentful. so if i can freely say no to you, then i am free to say yes, if that makes sense. although for me, it was hard to say no, but it gets easier, now it is easy. it wasn't at first.

EOS 2 0 3 The company just has to make cut backs and a lot of us are being furloughed. (2)  EOS 2 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I had the same situation not too long ago when the IT department I worked for realigned and my position was cut and I was laid off, so I completely understand the situation.  EOS 2 0 5 It is so hard to even contemplate finding a new job in this economy. (3)  EOS 2 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Just from sharing a few messages with you, I can tell how anxious you are about this,  EOS 2 0 7 Yes, it has me very worried. I have bills and kids and a husband - I need a job. (4)  EOS 2 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how difficult this situation is, but I know you will be able to get through this!  EOS 2 0 9 I've tried to get in touch with the unemployment office, but they are not answering the phones there I guess (5)  EOS 2 1 10 [Information] I know unemployment offices have been very busy during this pandemic  EOS 2 0 11 Ours does not even appear to be open.

EOS 2 0 13 No I need to do both of those things. I have not needed a resume for over 10 years (7)  EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] I would definitely update both, it helps to show new employers all of your relevant experience and what you have been doing.

EOS 3 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I hear you. It's been a terrible year all round for job seekers, given the global situation at the moment. I have been there myself.  EOS 3 0 4 Can you give me some advice on how to cope with this? I honestly don't know what to do.  EOS 3 1 5 [Others] Well, firstly I think you need to accept that this is not your fault and that at the moment the world situation is beyond your control.  EOS 3 0 6 I understand, but still, emotionally it is hard to cope.  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Are you able to cope financially whilst you are out of work?  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps you could take on some gig work just to earn a little extra spare cash?  EOS 3 0 9 Not really, my savings are running out. I am doing some part-time freelance work but it won't pay all the bills.  EOS 3 0 10 Do you have any suggestions?  EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been in the same situation and I know how frightening it is. Have you though of consulting agencies such as food banks that can help you temporarily?  EOS 3 0 12 I haven't been to food banks yet. I can still deal with food on the table for now, but a couple more months without job then I might have to.  EOS 3 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel that you can at least manage for a few more weeks?  EOS 3 0 14 Financially yes. It is just that my emotion is getting worse and worse. Stress I guess.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I think it might be a good idea for you to consult your doctor? It sounds as though you might be suffering from depression. 
[reference_response]	i think it might be a good idea for you to consult your doctor? it sounds as though you might be suffering from depression.

Are you looking for other employment opportunities yet?  EOS 3 0 9 i am beyond depressed but luckily i found a place but the take-home can't cut it  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's good that you were able to find another job, but I completely understand about the take home not being enough. Do you work full time, or is it just part time for now?  EOS 3 0 11 its just part time and i am even scared of covid 19 exposure  EOS 3 0 12 the take-home is just too small  EOS 3 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh, I understand being nervous about covid exposure, especially if you're working with the public, who may not abide by mask mandates and social distancing. Is there anything you can do to limit exposure?  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Also, are you able to look for a second job at all? The extra hours may bring in extra income while you try to find a single job that would pay enough.  EOS 3 0 15 it took me time to find this job, there is no work anywhere.  EOS 3 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you're really frustrated. That's completely understandable.  EOS 3 0 17 and there is nothing i can do about the covid exposure because folks around here sees nose mask as treat to Pres. Trump  EOS 3 0 18 i am beyond frustrated. it s soo depressing  EOS 3 1 19 [Self-disclosure] That is very frustrating. I know I find it very annoying when I see people out and about without masks. It drives me crazy, just thinking about how they're keeping this stupid pandemic going and keeping people out of work.  EOS 3 0 20 you got my point  EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] I wish I had more suggestions for you. I think the only thing you can do is keep looking, make sure your resume is updated and current. If there are any employment agencies in your area, they may be worth looking into. And if there are any public assistance programs you qualify for, there's no shame in seeking help when you need it.  EOS 3 0 22 i will keep doing that, may be something will show up  EOS 3 1 23 [Others] I sure hope it does. I wish you all the luck in the world.  EOS 3 0 24 thanks, it's nice talking about it  EOS 3 0 25 thanks for hearing me out  EOS 3 1 26 [Others] You're very welcome. I'm glad I could be here for you.

EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure they won't see you as needy or desperate if you've been with the company for 2 years already. Have you initiated the conversation with the board already?  EOS 0 0 5 No. This just happened last week so I am trying to keep all of the balls in the air. I was thinking about talking with them Wednesday this week. They are meeting on Thursday.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] That is a good idea. I would go over your resume and spruce it up before talking to them on Wednesday to add in anything pertinent that you might have learned or achieved during your time with the company these last two years. Make sure the day you approach them that you're well rested, clean and put together. Google some confidence stances and pay attention to your posture. Even if you're feeling nervous there are ways to hide it and appear confident.  EOS 0 0 7 Wow, that's really good advice. Thanks. I didn't think about updating my resume, and I really should have thought about it.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] No problem, I hope it helps.  EOS 0 0 9 Should I talk with my coworker about it? He does not want that job.  EOS 0 1 10 [Others] If you feel that he might be able to provide more advice then sure.  EOS 0 0 11 I just don't want him to think I am trying to weasle my way in.  EOS 0 1 12 [Information] If he isn't interested in the job himself I'm sure he wouldn't see it that way. It is natural for people to try to move up in a company when a job opening appears, especially in these current times. If you don't go for it then someone else will.  EOS 0 0 13 He does not want it. I was hoping I at least his support. He does support me. And thanks. I appreciate the insight.  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Having support in the workplace would be very helpful. If he truly does not want the job himself perhaps you could approach him about a memo or something that would back you? Something you can add to your resume from a peer that shows your initiative.  EOS 0 0 15 That would be a good idea. I was also thinking about talking with HR about it. We're a small company so that is only 1 person.  EOS 0 1 16 [Others] That could benefit you as well.  EOS 0 0 17 I was also going to talk with everyone in her office, which is only 2 people. I am worried about gossip though.  EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Unless you're known for doing bad things in the office I wouldn't sweat the gossip honestly. People are either going to support you or be jealous, either way I wouldn't let the talk get to you.  EOS 0 1 19 [Question] Do you feel like you're ready to tackle the tasks needed to prepare yourself for approaching the board Wednesday? 
[reference_response]	do you feel like you're ready to tackle the tasks needed to prepare yourself for approaching the board wednesday?

[contxt]	3 0 0 I am feeling very sad right now, my boyfriend just broke up with me out of the blue  EOS 3 1 1 [Question] I am so sorry that happened to you. It can be very difficult to cope with situations that seem they come out of nowhere. Did your boyfriend give you any reason for ending the relationship?  EOS 3 0 2 He said he has been struggling with depression and needed to be alone  EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Sometimes having depression can make a person feel that they need to seclude themselves. Were you aware that he felt this way?  EOS 3 0 4 He has been distant recently.  EOS 3 1 5 [Information] Unfortunately that can be a sign of depression or that something is going on. Have you been able to communicate with him previously about becoming distant?  EOS 3 0 6 Every time I would bring it up he would dismiss it. I just don't know what to do. How can I get him back?  EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe you could try to talk to him about seeking help for depression? Talking to someone close to him or even a professional would help him immensely. Talking to a counselor would help him learn ways to cope with his feelings.  EOS 3 0 8 That is a good idea. I want him to get back to being himself. He is like a different person right now. It's scary.  EOS 3 1 9 [Information] I understand completely. Depression runs in my family and if it goes untreated, can scare anyone that is involved. You can try suggesting that he talks to a close friend, family member, or counselor to talk about how he is feeling and ways to cope with it. Sometimes medication could be a good way to fix the chemical imbalance that can cause depression.  EOS 3 0 10 I will try to help him, he just doesn't want to seem to talk to my anymore. Do you have any suggestions on how to approach it with him?  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] You could start a conversation by saying that you just want to check on him and see if he is okay and how he is doing. You don't want to start the conversation by immediately telling him to get help, as he might just get defensive. 
[reference_response]	you could start a conversation by saying that you just want to check on him and see if he is okay and how he is doing. you don't want to start the conversation by immediately telling him to get help, as he might just get defensive.
[hypothesis_response]	i think that maybe a therapy could be helpful. you could ask him what his problem is, if he is unable to talk, or maybe even a counsellor a counselor could be able to help.

I don't know how to tell my spouse about my childhood in fear he doesn't want to be with someone with a upbringing such as mine.  EOS 0 1 2 [Others] Hi, thank you for chatting with me.  EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] From what I understand, you are struggling with childhood trauma and this is affecting everyday life with your child and spouse.  EOS 0 0 4 Yes, correct. I am not sure how to tell my spouse about my childhood trauma. He wants to know. He wants to help me. But I am not sure where to begin with explaining it to him.  EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a really hard situation to be in, but I know that you can have that conversation with your spouse!  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Does he have any idea about any of the trauma you have experienced?  EOS 0 0 7 I am worried it will effect his views on me. And he has a very rough idea of things that have happened.. he tells me he wants to know everything so he can help me move forward.. but when i try to talk about it i ramble and end up not explaining anything. I have even tried writing it down.. and nothing seems to work.  EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Just listening to you talk I can tell this is something that is making you extremely anxious.  EOS 0 0 9 very much so.. whenever it gets brought up i free and begin to ramble and i think it makes him overwhelmed ..  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] One thing I would suggest is after writing everything down that you rehearse it for a while in front of a mirror and picture that you are talking to your husband while you are doing this.  EOS 0 0 11 He had a very different childhood then myself. Almost complete opposite then myself. And I have tried... i cant seem to get my self to even put my past down on paper...  EOS 0 0 12 When I have tried to i end up sending my self into a panic.  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Have you reached out to other people or a group of people who may have experienced the same type of trauma you have?  EOS 0 0 14 No.. i do not know many people fro my area. As soon as i was able to leave where i grew up i packed up and left. We live in a extremely rural area where there is not many new faces.  EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have also experienced childhood trauma in my past and it was extremely hard to get through. I found talking to people who went through the same thing helped a lot.  EOS 0 0 16 Maybe i will have to look int finding support group in my area...thank you very much!  EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] After speaking with others in the same situation, I was able to convey this to my loved ones in a better way and I was much more comfortable with it,  EOS 0 0 18 thank you for your help!

EOS 3 0 14 Do you think meds are a good option? I'm worried if I take that route I might end up zoned out or addicted to taking them.  EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] when i am feeling down i like to go sit outside. vitamin d that we get from the sun is really importnat. i am inside a lot. i have had to start taking a supplement and it helps!  EOS 3 1 16 [Information] i've been onn and off antidppressants for about twenty years. antidepressants work with natural chemicals in your brain they are not addictive because they are not narcotic  EOS 3 0 17 Okay sure, so I could just go to my local pharmacy and pick up Vitamin D? Or is that prescribed by a doctor?  EOS 3 0 18 Okay that's good to know you have first hand experience.  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] you can look an amazon for herbal or natural options .st johns wort is a good one  EOS 3 0 20 Okay, what does that do? I havent heard of that supplement before.  EOS 3 1 21 [Information] vitamin d d is over the counter! any pharmacy, amazon, its easy to find and cheap  EOS 3 1 22 [Others] my friend swears by st johns wort. its some herb that is a natural anti depressant. you could do some research and see!  EOS 3 0 23 Okay that's useful. And there are no side effects to taking vitamin D, are there? I'll look into st john's wort. It seems as though there is loads of research to be done here - which is a little stressful!  EOS 3 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] it can be stressful but a positive stress. remember you are researching how to help yourself and feel better!  EOS 3 0 25 That's true, it's working towards an end goal of feeling like myself again. You are right.  EOS 3 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you'll be okay. i know its hard to stay positive, but i think you are doing pretty good  EOS 3 0 27 Thanks for that, it makes a difference to hear some encouragement.  EOS 3 1 28 [Others] i think we all need to support eachother during these uncertain times. at least with the vaccine there is a light at the end of the tunnel for a lot of people! :)  EOS 3 0 29 I don't want to overwhealm myself, but I think I'll go grab a coffee and take a look into Vitamin D and St Johns Wort now. I like the idea of using supplements and seeing how they work for me before moving onto heavier antidepressants.  EOS 3 0 30 That's true, I'm just hoping the end of the tunnel isn't too far away. Can't face another summer locked inside with nothing to do!  EOS 3 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sounds good! Enjoy your coffee and the rest of your day! :)  EOS 3 0 32 Thanks, I will do.

I later got a part-time job that the pay was low and i could not put up with the bills .it was really tough. I almost went into depression but I did not give up home.

EOS 3 0 10 But none of my partners have lived up to her  EOS 3 0 11 How did you come to that realization  EOS 3 0 12 Was it just time or was there something that you actually did  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I thought about the good times and bad.

EOS 3 0 19 Yes since that time I have dated other people , and many of them have been great people  EOS 3 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] They have been great people?

EOS 2 0 9 I have family but they live on the west coast im on the eastcoast  EOS 2 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I get that. It can be really frustrating when you feel alone and like you've got no one to talk to. Especially when 2020 seems to be dumping things on you.  EOS 2 1 11 [Question] What have you been doing to pass the time? Is there anything that you've found that makes you feel better?

EOS 2 0 24 Thats good advice, Im feeling a little better  EOS 2 0 25 I can take my iphone for music  EOS 2 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] I am glad. Practicing mindfulness can really help, and help put things in perspective. Often times we build things up to be even worse than they already are. Being able to be grateful for what's around can help, without diminishing the issues that you are facing.  EOS 2 0 27 Thats good advice, thanks I think you helped me  EOS 2 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] Remembering that it's okay to be sad and depressed, as much as it sucks, can be helpful in reframing.

[contxt]	1 0 4 So simple. I was in need of money, urgently, for my business. I helped him when he was in a similar situation. Now I am in situation, previously he was when I helped. I expected my friend surely will help. But he did not. This has put me some anger on him. This was a situation that happened 1 year before. Now I recall this for chatting.  EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Well, are you sure that he could have definitely afforded to loan you anything?  EOS 1 0 6 Yes. That was well within his limits and he should have obliged.  EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Well, the thing is, just because you had lent to him does not mean he is obliged to help you  EOS 1 1 8 [Others] Though of course it would have been the courteous thing to do  EOS 1 0 9 Thank you for your understanding and feeling. I feel some relax over the anger, just by your words.  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Is it possible to try to talk to him calmly and tell him exactly how he has made you feel?  EOS 1 0 11 Yes. I tried calmly of the situation. He told accepting as the situation has passed. I am not sure he has fully understood. As the situation passed, he says okay.  EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I think you need to decide whether you just just let it go or whether you cant' and won't be able to continue the friendship  EOS 1 0 13 However I continue the friendship not affected by this harassment.  EOS 1 1 14 [Question] Aren't you worried that it might rankle with you and surface again at some time to affect the friendship?  EOS 1 0 15 My behavior with him will not be affected because of this. But whenever I happen to think or recall of this I get to anger of it unavoidably. And cools off in some time.  EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] It is understandable. I hope that I have been able to help you a little and thank you for talking it out!  EOS 1 0 17 I need some more to chat with you. Is there any suggestion not to get angered again, even when having some recall or thought of the situation. That has been my problem.  EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought of trying any meditation exercises or breathing exercises... just to help you stay calm?  EOS 1 0 19 Generally I am cool, not an emotional person. If I need any special training, it should be only because of this. If there is some simple way that could help.  EOS 1 1 20 [Self-disclosure] I think you should give it a try - I have personally found breathing exercises very helpful! Thank you for talking, I must go now.  EOS 1 0 21 However it is not at all required. That anger does not affect me, just only feeling for some minutes. I let it go.  EOS 1 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] can you press quit and do the survey? It has to be done your end:) We've done ten turns each.  EOS 1 0 23 I think you suggest to try for breathing exercise. Do you feel benefited by that, often or rarely.  EOS 1 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] Yes I do but the task really is finished. Please press quit, I can't do it my end. Neither of us will get paid if you do not. Ten turns each and fifteen minutes .. we've done that. 
[reference_response]	yes i do but the task really is finished. please press quit, i can't do it my end. neither of us will get paid if you do not. ten turns each and fifteen minutes.. we've done that.

I know how bad it can feel when life throws you a curve-ball. Can you tell me about your situation?  EOS 4 0 5 my girlfriend was break up with me two days ago  EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear. That is a very upsetting situation. It sounds like you might be feeling lonely and rejected as a result of your girlfriend breaking up with you. Is that right?  EOS 4 0 7 yeah! we were in a relationship for three years, and suddenly she broke up with me  EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] That's a long time. I was in a similar situation not too long ago and I understand how hard this must be for you.  EOS 4 0 9 I taught that she was my everything hereafter.  EOS 4 0 10 but the fate plays a great game upon me  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] During a time like this, some people find it helpful to keep busy doing some kind of activity to take their mind off of their pain.

[contxt]	0 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] Getting laid off is no fault of your own, and at the least, your wife is still working, so you have a bit of time until things start to spiral  EOS 0 0 17 Wow, that is awesome. You mean deep breaths do help?  EOS 0 0 18 How often do i need the breaths?  EOS 0 1 19 [Information] Of course, breathing is the body's most calming function, you dont need a set amount of breaths, but take the time to be aware of the action and the stillness around you  EOS 0 1 20 [Information] It would help more than you think it will  EOS 0 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] In this time that you have, I think it would be nice to take the time you have with your family and enjoy it  EOS 0 0 22 I actually feel the support from my wife for which i am grateful but then my children are young to understand it all. I used to do a lot for them and constantly tell me to do the same but am unable cause it needs money  EOS 0 0 23 It is quite unfortunate that in my family we are used to finding joy as a family outside the home setting which requires spending and this we are not able to meet it often times as we have had to reduce spending  EOS 0 0 24 Apart from deep breaths, what other ways can i use to manage my anxiety?  EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] Spending time actively playing with your kids would help, along with morning exercise (but nothing too strenuous) if you choose to do so  EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] if you enjoy reading, I suggest taking the time to find a book that you used to enjoy and give it another read  EOS 0 1 27 [Others] it will remind you of a time when you were in a good place, and hopefully project that feeling back to you  EOS 0 0 28 Wow, am amazed! You mean anxiety can be managed so simply?  EOS 0 0 29 Wanna give it a try  EOS 0 1 30 [Information] I hope you do, positive attitude is the start to a healthy mind. This may not work for everything and the anxiety won't just disappear on day one or maybe ever, but these are steps you would want to start with :)  EOS 0 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Coping with anxiety is what you make of it, remember to not beat yourself up about things you ultimately cannot control.  EOS 0 0 32 sure. Let me adjust my attitude first and accept the situation. Hoping t cope with the situation in due course  EOS 0 0 33 Much grateful for the support  EOS 0 1 34 [Others] exactly: "maintain a hopeful outlook and visualize what you want rather than what you fear" I really hope I was able to help even if it was a little bit  EOS 0 0 35 That wasn`t little.

EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me  EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven't personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have.  EOS 6 1 7 [Question] How long were you together?  EOS 6 0 8 four years  EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being together that long must have made that break up difficult. How are you coping with it?  EOS 6 0 10 well I'm not really, especially as she'd gone off with someone else. But I'm to blame which makes it worse  EOS 6 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened?  EOS 6 0 12 I cheated on her on a drunken night. It was a one-off and I regret it terribly. But she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain.  EOS 6 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I see how she would be upset. It must be difficult for you though because she didn't give you another chance.

So how can I help you?  EOS 0 0 4 Lucky! It's raining and windy here!  EOS 0 0 5 I am having this constant problem where I am really tired and so I go to bed but I cannot fall sleep for sooo long  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] I am sorry to hear that, I used to have sleeping issues as well. What do you do in the hour leading up to bed time and what do you do in bed before you sleep?  EOS 0 0 7 I tend to watch TV or check my phone, once in bed I just try to relax and close my eyes  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I made a rule in my house where we cannot use any technology 1 hour before bed time. We read a book for example.  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] That might be something you can start to implement in your schedule. Cutting out technology 1 hour before bed time.  EOS 0 0 10 I think that is a good rule, I have to recognize I use too much technology specially towards the evening/night  EOS 0 0 11 I will try to stop all that and have a read tonight, what about if that does not work? Have you tried anything else?  EOS 0 1 12 [Others] Don't feel bad, we all do it in this day and age.  EOS 0 0 13 Thank you  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] I also have a playlist of what's known as "white noise". Think of rain falling on the windows, a stream of water flowing, birds tweeting. This is what I listen to while I'm lying in bed waiting to go to sleep. You could try this as well.  EOS 0 0 15 Yes! Thank you for that. I do love music and also the sound of the nature, it relaxes me... so I think that can work  EOS 0 0 16 I don't want to have to take pills to sleep or something like that if I can avoid it  EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes sleep issues are not about you doing something wrong, just about how you can set your mind in a better place.  EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] No 100%, you shouldn't take pills unless its absolutely necessary, and I don't think it is right now. I think you can do this without pills.  EOS 0 0 19 Absolutely, I agree with you. Thank you for your support. I believe I can create a much better sleeping routine  EOS 0 0 20 But it's just so easy to take the phone and start browsing news or check up funny videos  EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] No problem at all, its my pleasure. I believe you can as well :)  EOS 0 0 22 When did you have this same issue, long ago?  EOS 0 1 23 [Self-disclosure] Yes about 2 years ago I started to have sleep issues. I noticed the phone was the first thing I picked up after waking up, and the last thing I put down. It is terrible what technology and social media does to us. 
[reference_response]	yes about 2 years ago i started to have sleep issues. i noticed the phone was the first thing i picked up after waking up, and the last thing i put down. it is terrible what technology and social media does to us.

[contxt]	3 0 4 i feel alone eventhough i am in my home  EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your home work balance, are you working from home?  EOS 3 0 6 yes. i am working remotely from home due to this pandemic.  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand that you would feel lonely. Isolation is not healthy for any of us. It seems to be forced on us. Have you any friends or family you could call on the phone?  EOS 3 0 8 yes.i have. but , its bad that you can't meet them in person or you haven't gone out for a while.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is true, it feels terrible to not go out. We don't listen to the government anymore because we don't know anyone who died, so we still meet with our friends. I would be lost without them, however we don't meet as much so I do make it a point to call them. What will happen if you leave your home?  EOS 3 0 10 honestly, i am afraid to leave my home. we can't be so sure about our safety. so i am to be happy with the things i have. but the feeling of being left alone and work pressure sucks me more.  EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Do you have a lot of friends how were healthy that died?  EOS 3 0 12 i have lot of colleagues and friends. to the best of my knowledge, i don't think that the people who are healthy will die.  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have found that being in isolation lowers my immunity, and if I want to be healthy, fresh air, loving friends, exercise, good healthy food is the way to do it, not isolation and loneliness. That affect me emotionally and I don't want to despair, that makes me feel terrible. It doesn't feel healthy, and we know no one that has died either. But if you are not going to go out, do you have goals to help you not feel lonely, any ideas? Any thoughts on how you can fix this so you don't feel so lonely?  EOS 3 0 14 you are absolutely right. i just try to divert my mind on entertainment and cooking . my work burden increased to a greater extent.  EOS 3 1 15 [Information] You might even want to call your friends and colleagues to see if any of them are meeting up. We are social creatures. We need to socialize.  EOS 3 0 16 i can't afford much time .  EOS 3 0 17 considering the present situation, its bad for all of us to get socialized.  EOS 3 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure you are busy, but realize, your emotional health is important too and we always need to make time to connect with people.  EOS 3 0 19 you are right. may be i should think of more relevant options.  EOS 3 1 20 [Information] I think it is a trade off for us -- do we risk a disease we have a 99.9996% chance of survival from according to the CDC or stay at home and despair? I see no evidence of a pandemic nor do my nurse friends. So we live our lives normally. But some are afraid, and fear takes its toll on people. I say use your eyes, look around, if there aren't people dying all around you and you aren't hearing of a lot of people dying in ten months of this, there probably aren't a lot of people dying. And life is short. Hug those you love, you may not have them tomorrow, plandemic or not.  EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] I know you are working hard, but do try to switch up your life so you get some exercise and take care of your health, and perhaps list some people to call who you haven't checked in with in a while to switch up your life, bring some pizzazz.  EOS 3 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I was feeling REALLY lonely last month, and then I started a gratitude list and that helped, then I called some people and began to make new friends. It really helped a lot.

[contxt]	3 0 1 I am down. It happens sometimes and just takes so long to be happy. Do you ever feel this way?  EOS 3 1 2 [Self-disclosure] Unfortunately yes and it's been worse this year. I have tried certain coping mechanisms but some work better than others.  EOS 3 0 3 thanks for sharing. it nice knowing that this year has ben hard for lots of people. What do you do to get by?  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I have been trying to do as much walking as is allowed by the pandemic rule. I do love to get fresh air even though we're not allowed to go far.  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been getting help for your depression?  EOS 3 0 6 I tried getting help but it was not for me. now I am self diagnosing. self care. I tried taking walks but it never helped. anything else you do?  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Well alcohol, but I do not necessarily recommend that. Do you have many friends that you can talk to?  EOS 3 1 8 [Information] There are also counselling services out there that you might be able to access for free.  EOS 3 0 9 I hate the idea of talking to professionals. alcohol sometimes works but that is a slippery slope. like my depression  EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have suffered from depression for many years so I can totally empathise with you.  EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Is there any specific area that I could help you with?  EOS 3 0 12 just the rational of it. I know it is irrational but I can't help but be sad sometimes even when it is illogical. it's like my mind is heart my mind  EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I think that this just proves that you are human! I can understand that you are feeling really bad though and I'd like to help.  EOS 3 0 14 thank you.  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] I hope that I have been able to be of some help. It's sometimes hard to know what to say  EOS 3 0 16 You have been kind with your shared experiences. that make me feel not so alone and crazy. thank you  EOS 3 1 17 [Others] I wish you all the very best!  EOS 3 0 18 thank you again. can i ask you for one more recommendation  EOS 3 1 19 [Others] yes of course  EOS 3 0 20 please share  EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] Well, I think you need to find a hobby that will help you and that will enable you to make new friends.

[contxt]	0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure they won't see you as needy or desperate if you've been with the company for 2 years already. Have you initiated the conversation with the board already?  EOS 0 0 5 No. This just happened last week so I am trying to keep all of the balls in the air. I was thinking about talking with them Wednesday this week. They are meeting on Thursday.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] That is a good idea. I would go over your resume and spruce it up before talking to them on Wednesday to add in anything pertinent that you might have learned or achieved during your time with the company these last two years. Make sure the day you approach them that you're well rested, clean and put together. Google some confidence stances and pay attention to your posture. Even if you're feeling nervous there are ways to hide it and appear confident.  EOS 0 0 7 Wow, that's really good advice. Thanks. I didn't think about updating my resume, and I really should have thought about it.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] No problem, I hope it helps.  EOS 0 0 9 Should I talk with my coworker about it? He does not want that job.  EOS 0 1 10 [Others] If you feel that he might be able to provide more advice then sure.  EOS 0 0 11 I just don't want him to think I am trying to weasle my way in.  EOS 0 1 12 [Information] If he isn't interested in the job himself I'm sure he wouldn't see it that way. It is natural for people to try to move up in a company when a job opening appears, especially in these current times. If you don't go for it then someone else will.  EOS 0 0 13 He does not want it. I was hoping I at least his support. He does support me. And thanks. I appreciate the insight.  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Having support in the workplace would be very helpful. If he truly does not want the job himself perhaps you could approach him about a memo or something that would back you? Something you can add to your resume from a peer that shows your initiative.  EOS 0 0 15 That would be a good idea. I was also thinking about talking with HR about it. We're a small company so that is only 1 person.  EOS 0 1 16 [Others] That could benefit you as well.  EOS 0 0 17 I was also going to talk with everyone in her office, which is only 2 people. I am worried about gossip though.  EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Unless you're known for doing bad things in the office I wouldn't sweat the gossip honestly. People are either going to support you or be jealous, either way I wouldn't let the talk get to you.  EOS 0 1 19 [Question] Do you feel like you're ready to tackle the tasks needed to prepare yourself for approaching the board Wednesday?  EOS 0 0 20 I think so. I am not a gossip nor do I want to. Thanks for your help! Any other thoughts?  EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say maybe try some meditation or something to calm and center yourself. If you feel ready earlier than Wednesday then follow your intuition. You've got this!

EOS 0 0 4 I need ways alleviate stress while studying  EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there.  EOS 0 0 6 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you're in a dead end situation  EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck  EOS 0 0 8 How did you push past that job?  EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work.  EOS 0 0 10 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career?  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too  EOS 0 0 12 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation?  EOS 0 0 13 aside from luck that is  EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Can you give me some more details?  EOS 0 0 15 I just find the work mundane and way too remedial  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable  EOS 0 0 17 did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job?  EOS 0 1 18 [Information] I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit  EOS 0 0 19 what types of skill can I gain online?  EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs, honestly I would suggest looking at jobs that you normally wouldn't and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online.  EOS 0 0 21 so filter based on my absolute needs and go for online skills that I can complete?  EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] yes I think that is a great idea, look for jobs that meet your needs and figure out what you can do to look attractive to employers  EOS 0 0 23 I have tried glassdoor before, have you had any luck there?  EOS 0 1 24 [Information] I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed.  EOS 0 0 25 and have you showcased your skills using LinkedIn before? I have had that one recommended to me before, they said its a great way to neatly organize accomplishments and personal background  EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] Yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important.  EOS 0 0 27 do you have any examples of online skills you completed?  EOS 0 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] coursera has a lot of great courses, it really depends on what you are looking for.  EOS 0 0 29 if I was looking to enter the engineering field, any recommendations?  EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Is that what you are going to school for?  EOS 0 0 31 yes but I may change my mind  EOS 0 1 32 [Information] What year are you in? most engineering programs have a practicum and that is a great opportunity to make contacts and potentially get offered a job  EOS 0 0 33 yes I have been networking as I go  EOS 0 1 34 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly you seem like you are pretty on top of this I don't think you will have any issues finding a job.

[contxt]	3 0 1 I'm just feeling really down lately and would like to talk to someone who understands.  EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Feeling consistently sad is a tough place to be. I'm sorry to hear you're going through that.  EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I think since the pandemic it's gotten worse. It's hard to find the "reason" to go about my day.  EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand that. Are you working or attending classes from home?  EOS 3 0 5 I graduated in the spring but haven't been able to find a job because of what's going on, so that's been tough. My wife works from home though.  EOS 3 0 6 What about you?  EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It's very hard to maintain a sense of consistency when we have few boundaries on our time, or a daily routine.  EOS 3 0 8 Very true!  EOS 3 0 9 I try to keep a routine with exercise and cooking, things like that. Going outside for walks...  EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have been attending school online, and I occasionally make deliveries for my husband and I's small business.  EOS 3 0 11 Oh that's great!  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, a daily routine is good for normalizing change. It's also good for structuring in time to relax and recharge, which you still need even if you aren't currently employed. Times are still very stressful and uncertain, and that takes an emotional toll no matter who you are.  EOS 3 0 13 That's true. Very good points. It's hard to find a purpose right now because I'm unable to find work. When I started going to school I certainly wasn't expecting any of this to be happening (obviously). I waited until my 30s to go to college so I feel angry that all of this is happening.  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand being angry about that. Going to school supposedly is/was a way to take control of one's life, it's no longer the guarantee is once was. 
[reference_response]	i understand being angry about that. going to school supposedly iswas a way to take control of one's life, it's no longer the guarantee is once was.
[hypothesis_response]	i understand completely. it sounds like you've been working in your life for a long time, so it'll be hard to keep up with the changes you'd like to see in your own life. i don't know how long you'll keep working, but i know that you'l find some new goals and goals that will help you find a better life.
[comet query]	That's true. Very good points. It's hard to find a purpose right now because I'm unable to find work.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hello, I could be better....  EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Do you want to go into whats going on right now?  EOS 3 0 3 Yes, I would like to. I am taking depression drugs that are not making a change to my condition. I need expert help, not a bandaid.  EOS 3 1 4 [Information] I see, have you just started them?  EOS 3 0 5 I have about two months on the meds and I do not think it needs more time to take effect in my system. I know working things out while talking to someone on this platform would work, so here I am  EOS 3 1 6 [Information] With medicine like that, it can take months to take its full effect. Stopping can reverse and even make the depression come back worse. Have you told your Doctor your concerns?  EOS 3 0 7 Yes, I have told my doctor my concerns and he mentioned this portal to go talk to someone without a face to get a broader view on your problems. This method has been working for a lot of his patients so far.  EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hmm, well yes this can be helpful but that is strange he did not run any tests to see how the medication is reacting with you. On that note though what is going on with you now?  EOS 3 0 9 I am crying everyday and need to know what can I do on daily basis to keep me busy from doing other things that can harm me....  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I would look to talk to a therapist about these matters. Platforms like this can help with some issues but if you are not reacting to the medication and these thoughts are still occurring then that is the path i would take.  EOS 3 0 11 Therapist wants me to use this. My blood work will be done this week.  EOS 3 1 12 [Information] Im not telling you to quit on your therapist but if their techniques are not working for you, or you do not think they are a good fit. You should not feel guilty looking for one that is better suited to your needs. Self harm is a very serious issue that strangers really cannot help you with.  EOS 3 0 13 I understand.  EOS 3 1 14 [Information] So it is your therapist, or psychiatrist that put you on this medication? Do you feel they listen to you? 
[reference_response]	so it is your therapist, or psychiatrist that put you on this medication? do you feel they listen to you?

[contxt]	0 0 3 I have been tired a lot lately, even when I sleep for 8 hours. I am not sure what to really do to help myself gain more energy and recover my sleeping schedule to normal.  EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I see. Are you finding it hard to function on not enough sleep? I have experienced that at times as well, and found it quite frustrating!  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] How much sleep are you getting now? Do you keep irregular sleep hours, e.g. the time you go to bed and get up?  EOS 0 0 6 Yes, I had a bad sleeping schedule, when I would go to sleep around 2-3am. I now get around 8 hours of sleep but I feel like it isn't enough still.  EOS 0 0 7 Would this relate to a health problem of not being active or maybe stress?  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I used to be a night owl, going to bed early in the morning. I reset my schedule very gradually. I went to bed 15 minutes earlier, and set an alarm for 8 hours later. I did that for 3 days, then I would ratchet it back another 15 minutes. It was a gradual process and the only way I could fix it.  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] Are you getting any exercise during the daytime?  EOS 0 0 10 I see, I should set more alarms for myself. I have not put the time to exorcise as I would like to. I was planning on ordering a pair of weighted jump ropes for myself.  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] Even a walk may help you sleep...I know it does for me, Jump ropes are a great idea! I was advised it's better to exercise earlier in the day, not too close to bedtime or it can affect sleep.  EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you have trouble getting to sleep or waking up in the night? Or is it more a case of just not feeling rested after your sleep?  EOS 0 0 13 I mostly work and go to school during the day so there really isn't too much time unless I decide to exorcise early in the morning. By the end of the day, I already feel exhausted from work and most of my motivation to exorcise is gone.  EOS 0 0 14 I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night.  EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see. Sleep problems are very common you certainly aren't alone in this. With some changes I am confidant you can improve your sleep.  EOS 0 0 16 Do you have any suggestions other than exorcising to help with sleeping?  EOS 0 0 17 Anything would be taken into consideration if possible.  EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I listen to a really good podcast called Tracks to Relax. It's guided meditation that helps me deeply relax before I sleep.  EOS 0 1 19 [Self-disclosure] sometimes I use it in the middle of the night too, if I can't fall back asleep!  EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried meditation before bed?  EOS 0 0 21 Oh wow, I never really thought listening to relaxing music to help go back to sleep. I will try that out tonight! I have never done meditation before bed, mostly during the day.

[situation]	It started during my childhood, when I was 9 years old, living my father. He had a bad temper and was impatient with me, especially with school. He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes. After the age of 10, I ended up living with my mother but I would spend most of my time with my friends because I enjoyed their company more than anything. I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well. Today, I still try my best to tolerate going to college and do my best in classes even when my anxiety comes back.

[contxt]	3 0 0 Hi!  EOS 3 0 1 Hello, are you there?  EOS 3 1 2 [Others] Hello how are you  EOS 3 0 3 I'm doing okay. How are you?  EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Great how is everything going for you  EOS 3 0 5 Not fantastic. I'm struggling in my job and I feel isolated every day.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Why do you feel isolated?  EOS 3 0 7 Because even though I work in a large school, I feel like if there are any issues in my classroom with students, no one will help me out.  EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand. I don't worked at a school and the teachers did not receive much support. Is that what is making you stuggle at work?  EOS 3 0 9 I don't understand your question.  EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Is it the lack of support at the school that is causing you to struggle?  EOS 3 0 11 Yes. That's what I said.  EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Sorry I asked about the isolation and you mentioned the reason was the work. So im just trying to confirm your lack of support at school is the reason for your struggle. Does the feeling of isolation stem from that?  EOS 3 0 13 Yes. I am feeling isolated because management at my work is not supporting me.  EOS 3 1 14 [Others] Understandable.Do they have any kind of help groups at your school?  EOS 3 0 15 Not really. They try to say that we should all make sure we are looking after our mental health, but they do nothing that would actually help us or give us a way to do it.  EOS 3 1 16 [Information] Is there something you have in mind that might help your situation and theyre not listening?  EOS 3 0 17 If a student is not focusing and causing disruption in a classroom, then I think they should definitely do something to help manage the beahviour of the student. Yes.  EOS 3 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Agreed with 20 some students after repeatedly trying with a student you cannot keep stopping the lecture to discipline. Of course there should be some help in place.  EOS 3 0 19 Okay. Do you have any support or advice?  EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Ive seen this first hand and teachers really have their hands full. I know most parents are busy, but have you tried to connect with the parents maybe they can step in and talk to their children.  EOS 3 0 21 That's good advice and I have, but the parents are part of the problem. They care less than their own child.  EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] There are also several community groups with different kids of occupations. Ive seen multiple ones for teachers helping each other by sharing their own methods. That might help with some ideas.  EOS 3 0 23 That's also a nice idea. Thank you.  EOS 3 0 24 Okay, thank you for your help today. Hace a nice day. Bye!

[contxt]	0 0 1 Much better than normal, even though the stock market is down.  EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Are you an investor?  EOS 0 0 3 I am a student that tries to put as much money into as possible.  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life. Has this affected you negatively?  EOS 0 0 5 No the stock market really doesn't cause stress for me, mostly just small things that I think my brain overreacts to.  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What sorts of things?  EOS 0 0 7 Kind of a variety of things. I typically get bad anxiety after a night of going out. So I am trying to cut out drinking.  EOS 0 1 8 [Question] So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety? Do you suffer from anxiety when you do not drink ever?  EOS 0 0 9 Sometimes but I think the root from them comes from when I do something while I'm drinking. Not that I do anything bad, but I just don't like not remembering things.  EOS 0 1 10 [Question] So you would say that you drink to the point of blacking out? Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you've had a reasonable amount of alcohol?  EOS 0 0 11 I used to black out a lot, but I have tried to control it by cutting the former amount of drinks I consumed in half, if I do choose to go out.  EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I have drank to the point of blacking out several times in my life mostly when I was younger and I found that it either came from a certain type of alcohol or mixing different types. Have you noticed it could be related to that or simply the amount of alcohol you are drinking?  EOS 0 0 13 It is typically the amount I'm drinking, but cutting out drinking as a whole has probably helped me the most.  EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks. Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep...the amount you drink. Do your friends encourage you to drink more?  EOS 0 0 15 They don't necessarily attempt to get me to drink more in volume, but I do have to tell them I'm not gonna go out for the night.  EOS 0 1 16 [Question] Are they okay with it when you decline? 
[reference_response]	are they okay with it when you decline?
[hypothesis_response]	it seems like it would be a lot easier if you could just tell them you're drinking more than you need to. you can just ask them to stop and not ask if they think you are doing anything wrong.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Not great. I think I have a problem with alcohol.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How so?  EOS 3 0 3 I've been drinking a lot and some mornings I wake up not remembering the night before.  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I have done that myself, but being self aware is an advantage not many people have. How long has this been happening?  EOS 3 0 5 A couple of months on and off, but it's gotten a lot worse the last couple of weeks.  EOS 3 0 6 I'm afraid I'm going down a bad road, but I don't know how to stop.  EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] These are not the best times... but lets dig deeper to the root of this new behavior.  EOS 3 0 8 How do we do that?  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have been down that road myself, and I didn't have anyone to help me. But luckily, you have resources and support. Help me understand what makes you drink? Is it a trigger like stress? Or just a habit?  EOS 3 0 10 Work has been stressful, but I feel like was before things got bad. Most nights I come home to drink so that I can forget about my day.  EOS 3 1 11 [Question] What do you do for work?  EOS 3 0 12 I work in finance at a large corporation.  EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I can definitely understand your reasoning. I am not justifying your behavior, but at least we see now, it goes hand in hand. The corporate dinner parties and cocktail hours.. it is usually much deeper than the surface  EOS 3 0 14 Hmm. I never thought of it that way.  EOS 3 0 15 I guess maybe I need to look into how such events affect me.  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Usually when I find myself going off the deep end, I can reign it back by realizing that the power lies in me. My control to use a relaxer like a cocktail hour, to just be that. It does not have to be a contest. It should make you feel good, then leave it. But if you cannot control it, try and de-stress another way like baths or massages  EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are pretty self aware, which is a great short cut to this dilemma.  EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] You can use this to your advantage, and make more conscious choices to better your life

EOS 0 0 4 Work is becoming a burden. I've just graduated college and my first ever job is stressful!  EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh wow! Well first of all, I want to say that I definitely empathize with you. My first job out of college was one of the most stressful times of my life. It does get better though.  EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What is stressful about your job?  EOS 0 0 7 Everyone I've reached out to has said the same. There are several factors that make my job stressful. The biggest issues are working from home and unrealistic deadlines.  EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Oh wow, that sounds really hard, and I can only imagine it is so difficult to be breaking into a new career entirely working from home. Even people I know who have been in their jobs a long time are struggling with remote work. It is hard if your company is not being flexible on deadlines during this time.  EOS 0 1 9 [Question] Have you found any strategies that have helped a tiny bit?  EOS 0 0 10 It has been very hard in general, training has been a nightmare! I've tried to develop some coping strategies but they seem to fly out the window when i'm really stressed. I tend to over eat in these situations aswell.  EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I totally feel that! I think that has been a struggle for me during quarantine too - the "quarantine fifteen!" I have had to look for other forms of comfort to keep that at bay ... but I did bake cookies tonight :)  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I know I'm just an mturk rando, but the one thing I know that has helped almost everyone I know with career stress is having a mentor. Especially someone who is not at your company. Do you know anyone, even a friend of a friend, who could maybe be a sounding board for your career?  EOS 0 0 13 Haha you're a good rando. I would love to have someone to be a guide in my career but most of my family are blue collar workers. Whenever I vent they think its a joke because my job is cushy and pays extremely well. I'm honestly the snowflake in the family.  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Oh say no more! I totally get that just based on my own background as well. The only thing I could recommend is to cast a wide net when thinking about mentorship... maybe even a former professor in your field could recommend a former student who graduated a few years before you. Just a thought, but I know for myself, it's nice to have validation if the people I am working with are having unfair expectations.  EOS 0 1 15 [Question] I hope that helped a bit, and if not, please let me know. We can keep chatting and dig into this a bit more if you'd like. What do you think?  EOS 0 0 16 You definitely given me some food for thought, I didn't think this would go so well lol  EOS 0 0 17 Makes me feel a little less lonely today :)  EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really enjoyed talking with you!

He is not treating her well, rude, gaslighting and treating the dog better. He is also not very nice to our grandaughter  EOS 1 0 6 This is confidential, Right?  EOS 1 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, of course it is :). So we are talking about your daughter and her husband and their child together, right?  EOS 1 0 8 Yes, He is a nice guy to others. At home he is so different.  EOS 1 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand, people can often show different sides depending on who is around. Do you have any reason to think your daughter or granddaughter are in physical danger?  EOS 1 0 10 No, they are safe. He's, like I said, a nice guy. Our Daughter, we are very close and she would tell us.  EOS 1 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] That's great news! It sounds as though you are just concerned about how she is sometimes being treat. Have you had any conversation with your daughter about their relationship?  EOS 1 0 12 Yes, numerous. Like I said we are close to our daughter. She wants to stay together and talks with him.  EOS 1 0 13 He stays for whatever reason. I wish he would talk to me, to us. We have offered.  EOS 1 0 14 He knows that we care about him.  EOS 1 1 15 [Information] And that is so important and good to know there is trust from his side, to me it sounds as though that could be an olive branch for you to try and establish a conversation with both of them. An open and positive communication is always the first step in resolving anything.  EOS 1 0 16 We have tried this before when we visit and he appears receptive. Treats he well and then when we are gone. He falls back into he behaviour.  EOS 1 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I recently went though a similar exercise with a friend and her boyfriend.

EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There's nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend?  EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking.  EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that's not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it?  EOS 5 0 7 they're still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander  EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] that's an option but I hope it doesn't go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend?  EOS 5 0 9 no. i don't want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too  EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that. You don't want two people disrespecting you.  EOS 5 0 11 absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don't allow to be disrespected by anyone  EOS 5 1 12 [Question] I hear that! What happened in court when you went?  EOS 5 1 13 [Others] If you don't mind me asking  EOS 5 0 14 i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn't strong enough.  EOS 5 1 15 [Question] Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can. Has she been in contact with you?  EOS 5 0 16 no. she hasn't done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her  EOS 5 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Seems like a good idea. Steer clear of her and don't associate with her! Sounds like you're doing the right thing. Keep your side of the street clean  EOS 5 0 18 absolutely will avoid her. if she ever convinces my friends should i tell them i don't want to associate with them anymore?  EOS 5 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I would if I were in your shoes. You don't need two of the same person. Know what I mean?  EOS 5 0 20 yeah exactly. people need to realize who's side to stay on  EOS 5 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] LOL if only everyone had that thought process. Some people don't get it!  EOS 5 0 22 it's easier said than done. a lot of people are afraid of being alone and will put up with garbage  EOS 5 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Definitely sounds like you have the right tools and mindset to do the right thing! 
[reference_response]	definitely sounds like you have the right tools and mindset to do the right thing!
[hypothesis_response]	exactly! i've been in the situation where someone had their side of things and i was just as upset as them. i was able to move on from the situation. it'll be hard, but i'd say you'll have a better chance of getting over it.

[contxt]	3 0 0 hello  EOS 3 0 1 i wonder if there is anyone there...  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Hi! I am here. How are you today?  EOS 3 0 3 not great. how are you.  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm so sorry to hear that.  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] What is wrong?  EOS 3 0 6 just blue. not anything in particular.  EOS 3 0 7 this time of year the days get so short... the darkness comes early. and it makes me blue.  EOS 3 1 8 [Information] definitely. The short days make it so hard to smile. Your body needs sun. There are ways to cheer yourself up though!  EOS 3 0 9 staring a a computer all day is probably not one of the ways...  EOS 3 0 10 what makes you smile  EOS 3 0 11 the crack of the top of a creme brule?  EOS 3 0 12 the smell of autumn leaves?  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] Oh definitely doesn't help but I understand.

[contxt]	4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that. How long have you been in a slump?  EOS 4 0 4 Quite a while, of course it really got worse once the pandemic hit  EOS 4 0 5 I am in a pretty bad marriage he is not supportive in any way. It's getting worse instead of better.  EOS 4 0 6 I suppose I used to be able to distract myself with the outside world and right now I cant  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand that. It's been hard on a lot of people. Sometimes marriages need a bit of help during tough times, have you considered a counselor?  EOS 4 0 8 I have tried, he won't go again. We have before and it didn't really help. He argued with her  EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] My husband and I have gone a few times and it really helped having an objective person give us a few tips. We learned a lot even in just a few short months. We set goals, achieved them and then years passed and went again.  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] That's too bad that he won't go again. I would still go for yourself. I have gone by myself because I needed extra help. And it's hard to deal with someone who doesn't want to grow and change.  EOS 4 0 11 I am happy it worked for you :) I just dont see it working with us. Hes pretty stubborn. I also struggle with a severe auto immune disorder so that is always weighing on me as well  EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I had an auto immune disorder too, actually, the counseling helped that a lot. Emotions have a way of wreaking havoc on our bodies. And it sounds like life has been stressful for you lately.  EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] Having a physical problem is really hard to deal with in addition to problems in marriage. Do you have any goals set?  EOS 4 0 14 Yes, stress is terrible for chronic illness. I had goals to get back in check with myself, I've been worried about everyone else for so long and not really about me. The pandemic haulted a lot of that. I used to take rides and go out and enjoy nature or something simple by myself to rejuvinate but it's harder now being worried to be around people. I also have an 8 and 1 year old. While they are my world, it's taxing having littles depend on you 24/7 without a breather :)  EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you have a full plate with the little one. I know a lot of people are fearful now, but rest assured, children are really resilient to disease. The CDC has not even one record of a healthy child dying. Can you still go to the park and let them run and play? I think it's healthier to be around people then to isolate. That's my personal observation. It's really taking a toll on all of us emotionally to be distant.  EOS 4 1 16 [Others] little ones . . .  EOS 4 0 17 For a few months I eased up and let them play at the park, but we live in MI which is having another huge spike, especially our county. Thank goodness we have a pretty large yard for them to run and play in but I also know its not the same  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] One thing that comes to mind about your marriage is how I continued to work on myself, and surprisingly, some of the changes I made in myself helped my husband change. For example. I realized I didn't speak respectfully to him all the time. So I changed my tone. Sometimes I didn't FEEL respectful, but I read this book explaining how men really need that. So I changed me. And you know what, he really responded well to that. Became more kind and loving. I prayed a lot and that is one thing God showed me. I read a few books on what men were like and how I could help my marriage. My husband often oblivious, but when I worked on me and doing things that men like, he actually became a better man. Hard to explain.  EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I would encourage you to write out some goals and things you want to change about yourself, ideas for you and your children to do. And fight the blues as hard as you can. I find that if I have a list of things I need to do, I can follow that even when I don't feel like it, and sometimes I get out of the slump.

EOS 3 0 3 Now i am better  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know that things have been hard during this pandemic for a lot of people.  EOS 3 0 5 Expect to have lot of mixed feelings.  EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Mixed feelings have you been having? It's completely normal and understandable to have them.  EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes when you are having mixed feelings, you can try writing them down on a piece of paper. This can help you identify how you are feeling.  EOS 3 0 8 i have very mixed feelings about the whole issues .My mixed feeling stem from the fact that those are not reflected anywhere.  EOS 3 0 9 I have no minded with writing things.  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I could understand how difficult that must be for you. You could try taking a walk outside and getting some fresh air. Fresh air can always help to clear your mind.  EOS 3 0 11 please help another way to reduce my depression.  EOS 3 1 12 [Others] Does doing art work help you to feel better usually?

[contxt]	4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure it's frustrating that you're not getting the emotional support you need. It's great that you are reaching out to communicate with someone.  EOS 4 0 8 I heard of people falling for a fling or one night stand but this has gone on for months. Add to that, I see him at work. He's married and I don't see this as more than a long term hook up. Have you ever experienced something like this?  EOS 4 0 9 If you never experienced this do you know of anyone who has? What did they do to get out of this type of relationship if you want to call it that?  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I can sense your frustration, and his marriage just adds to that. I've known lots of people who've ended up in relationships with married people.  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Just reaching out to talk with someone else is a great first step.  EOS 4 0 12 What did those people do to end the relationship if you want to call it that?  EOS 4 0 13 You keep saying it's good to reach out. I'm reaching out to you trying to find a way to turn off my emotions for this man.  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes, a good first step is to reach out to friends who can help you fill your time and avoid interactions with him.  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] And co-workers often can help you find ways to avoid him in the office. Are others aware of the relationship who can help you with that?  EOS 4 0 16 My friends don't know about my situation with Doug. I do suspect some people at work are putting us eating lunch and taking walks together as something more. +  EOS 4 0 17 Doug make my sing and makes my body come alive but his presence is starting to break my heart because this situation is not going anywhere. I need help! It's not Doug's problem it's mine!  EOS 4 0 18 I don't like his wife because if she was treating him well he wouldn't be with me. So why doesn't she just let him go?  EOS 4 0 19 I'm starting to think if she was out the picture Doug and I could be together in a real relationship you know what I mean?  EOS 4 1 20 [Others] I can hear your anguish, and I understand your frustration. It's not clear to me, though, that Doug is being honest with you or with his wife.  EOS 4 1 21 [Question] You mentioned that Doug can't provide the emotional support that you need. Do you think he's being fully honest with you about his relationship with his wife?  EOS 4 0 22 I don't understand. Doug's married I know that but I want what his wife has so she's not the problem.  EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You're absolutely right. It sounds like Doug is the problem. He's cheating on his wife, and he's not giving you the emotional support you need.  EOS 4 0 24 All I want to know from you is to tell me how to get rid of the feelings I have for Doug or how to get rid of his wife since you think she's part of the problem?  EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] With the holidays coming up, maybe you could avoid him for an extended stretch and really do something about what it is you are looking for in a partner.  EOS 4 0 26 Like what? The media says stay inside with love ones. Doug is my love one. Wouldn't I be putting myself at risk of getting the conrovirus meeting someone new?  EOS 4 1 27 [Others] I wouldn't say that Doug's wife is part of the problem. She's sounds like another victim of his philandering and dishonesty. 
[reference_response]	i wouldn't say that doug's wife is part of the problem. she's sounds like another victim of his philandering and dishonesty.
[hypothesis_response]	i can understand that. i think that you'll find a good person in a relationship. you could try to talk to someone that you can talk to about it and find out what you really need and how to deal with the situation.

EOS 1 0 2 Yes that's right. It's frustratgn  EOS 1 0 3 *frustrating  EOS 1 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co-worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective.  EOS 1 0 5 Unfortunately I can't really talk to anyone at work because there is no one I trust to this extent. Promotions are a bit of a sensitive issue  EOS 1 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered?  EOS 1 0 7 The HR department favours managers so I am worried that will damage my chances of promotion further  EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry you have to deal with this at work. I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated.  EOS 1 0 9 Thanks, that's good to hear  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion.

EOS 1 0 3 My wife just told me that yesterday on a party my best friend flirted with my wife and asked her if she wants to have sex with him.  EOS 1 1 4 [Others] Oh no and how did this make you feel?  EOS 1 0 5 I am disgust and very angry to my friend  EOS 1 0 6 We've been friend since high school  EOS 1 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I could imagine it did make you feel that way.

EOS 1 0 8 I totally agree, it's unacceptable in any society I think  EOS 1 0 9 I am so angry now I want to smash his face  EOS 1 1 10 [Information] Yes, most definitely. Your feelings are very valid in this situation. However, physical violence would not be the best solution because you could get in trouble.  EOS 1 0 11 That's what my wife is also telling me.  EOS 1 0 12 But what can I do then? I want to smash things now  EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] First, I would suggest that you distanced yourself or even stopped being friends with this person. Second, for the anger that you feel, there are a lot of things you could do like going running, going for a walk, or even crying  EOS 1 1 14 [Information] It's important that you do not hold these feelings in.  EOS 1 0 15 I don't want to cry sorry, I want hit something  EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered punching a bag in the gym? That can be a great way for you to release that anger.

EOS 1 0 19 What do you thing  EOS 1 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] You could definitely call him and express your feelings to him as that would be another great way to get how you're feeling off of your chest.

EOS 0 1 5 [Question] What is happening at work that makes you feel likes that?  EOS 0 0 6 I just feel like im not getting the support I need.  EOS 0 0 7 I'm relatively new at my job, so I go to the more senior staff for advice, but I seldom ever get help.  EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see, is there anyone you could talk to at work that could possibly help you?  EOS 0 0 9 I have a couple of coworkers that have been helpful, but we don't always work together. And their help isn't always the best, or the type of support I am looking for.  EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see how that would be difficult.  EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe if there is something specific you need help with, you could ask a coworker or senior staff.  EOS 0 0 12 Yeah, it has been very difficult. Do you have any reccomendations? Or what would you do in the situation?  EOS 0 0 13 I generally do do that. Sometimes I get the help I need, others not so much. So i feel like im second guessing myself a lot, which puts me under a lot of stress.  EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Since you are relatively new it is understandable that it may be difficult. I would see if there is someone I could confide in. They may be understanding.  EOS 0 0 15 I think thats a good idea. I am concerned it may not work out. What would i do then?  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Is there something specific you are feeling you need more help with? Maybe the people you are asking do not understand exactly what you need help with.  EOS 0 0 17 Decision making and the little details are where I am struggling. I've had adequate training, but i still feel as though I lack the expertise needed to do my job well. Someimtes I get the support I need, and other times i don't. I'm wondering what i should do in times where I am not getting the support I need if its not available.  EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is understandable. I have been in situations where I had to make difficult decisions at my job too. Overtime you will be gaining experience and it will most likely get easier or you'll get better.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hello there. I am feeling a bit down.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Would you like to go into the reasons why you are feeling down?  EOS 3 0 3 Sure. I am not going to be able to do Thanksgiving with my parents because of Covid and I am kind of bummed out about it. Some mild depression.  EOS 3 1 4 [Providing Suggestions] I hear that, we are only doing it for just our house this year. Have you considered doing something virtual?  EOS 3 0 5 Well yeah, but it's not the same. I know I am doing the right thing, but it still sucks.  EOS 3 1 6 [Information] Yea some times the right thing does suck, and i know its not the same. I do know zoom has removed the 40 min restrictions for thanksgiving, so at least you can see your parents as long as you want.  EOS 3 0 7 Oh that's nice, I didn't know that. Thanks. I thought about trying a video wifi call on the phone but that would be better.  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Thought it might help a little. These times do hurt but at least you are being smart about it. I would maybe try to plan something fun you guys could do over the call. Make it a bit interesting.  EOS 3 0 9 Yes, I think I going to get some bread pudding and drop it off over there too. I can take enough precautions to make sure it is safe for them.  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh thats nice that you are close enough to be able to do that now. At least you will be able to taste a bit of home cooking right? 
[reference_response]	oh thats nice that you are close enough to be able to do that now. at least you will be able to taste a bit of home cooking right?

[contxt]	3 0 0 Hi  EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today?  EOS 3 0 2 Quite bad. I tried to send some job applications but there are still no reply.  EOS 3 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I hear you. It's been a terrible year all round for job seekers, given the global situation at the moment. I have been there myself.  EOS 3 0 4 Can you give me some advice on how to cope with this? I honestly don't know what to do.  EOS 3 1 5 [Others] Well, firstly I think you need to accept that this is not your fault and that at the moment the world situation is beyond your control.  EOS 3 0 6 I understand, but still, emotionally it is hard to cope.  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Are you able to cope financially whilst you are out of work?  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps you could take on some gig work just to earn a little extra spare cash?  EOS 3 0 9 Not really, my savings are running out. I am doing some part-time freelance work but it won't pay all the bills.  EOS 3 0 10 Do you have any suggestions?  EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been in the same situation and I know how frightening it is. Have you though of consulting agencies such as food banks that can help you temporarily?  EOS 3 0 12 I haven't been to food banks yet. I can still deal with food on the table for now, but a couple more months without job then I might have to.  EOS 3 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel that you can at least manage for a few more weeks?  EOS 3 0 14 Financially yes. It is just that my emotion is getting worse and worse. Stress I guess.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I think it might be a good idea for you to consult your doctor? It sounds as though you might be suffering from depression.  EOS 3 0 16 I don't know. Psychologist appointments are very expensive in my country.  EOS 3 0 17 And without a job I do not have any insurance.  EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry to hear that. I have had therapy but it is free in my country. Are there any charities that might offer a limited amount of counselling time?  EOS 3 0 19 I have not heard of charities that does that. If I am suicidal, may be, but I guess they are not dealing with stress from normal job seekers...  EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Would you be prepared to take on a job that is outside of your normal field and income bracket, just temporarily?  EOS 3 0 21 I would. I work as an IT consultant before, but I would take any job for now.  EOS 3 1 22 [Question] I know that it is very difficult with so many businesses being forced to close. Would you be prepared to do delivery work, perhaps?  EOS 3 0 23 Do you mean like food delivery? like UberEats?  EOS 3 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] Yes. Or most restaurants are offering take out services at the moment so there will be delivery services out there  EOS 3 0 25 I guess I could try that, not sure it pays well enough.  EOS 3 0 26 But thank you for your help.  EOS 3 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are most welcome. I hope that things will pick up come the new year and you can get back to your regular profession! Just try to think of this as a stop gap

I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though.  EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Could you tell me what the issue is in particular?  EOS 0 0 3 It's just a huge amount of work that I'm struggling with and a ton of exams and they give me a lot of anxiety  EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming.  EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] Make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can. When you feel capable of doing well on said exams, you will feel a lot less pressure.  EOS 0 0 6 Do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though?  EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to?  EOS 0 0 8 yes it's all virtual though  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Well at least is something. I am sure talking to someone who might be able to guide you academically will be a significant relief.  EOS 0 0 10 That is a good idea. Do you personally recommend anything on how to balance my schedule and still be able to have my time to do other things?  EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] When I was at college, I usually aimed at 2 hours of studying everyday (+ homework) and I also aimed to have at least 2 hours of leisure time.  EOS 0 0 12 I see, and how were you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep and healthy eating habits during college?  EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I honestly didn't eat very healthy. If you live with your parents, I think a proper nutrition is easier. I usually slept around 7 hours each night. I picked most of my classes on the afternoon, worked out in the mornings.  EOS 0 0 14 okay i understand, and what do you suggest for when you do poorly on an exam that you studied so hard for, how do you keep yourself from feeling down?  EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I would suggest talking to the professor or an academic advisor to explore strategies that could help you improve  EOS 0 0 16 okay but is it normal to be upset?  EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course, it is normal to feel upset. However, you should not blame yourself. No one is perfect.

EOS 3 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been feeling the same way lately -- my family has been distracted and stressed and it's rubbing off on me. Are there other people around that you can spend time with?  EOS 3 0 4 Not really, I'm not a people person and the couple people I do talk to aren't supportive or going thru their own issues.  EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. It seems to me that much of what makes the holidays worthwhile is the opportunity to spend time with people we care about. It makes sense that you would have a hard time celebrating with nobody there to share it with you.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Are you close with your family these days?  EOS 3 0 7 I have my family to share it with, my husband and kids. The teenagers are more about me buying them stuff and getting presents, and we're broke so I haven't been able to do the things I want to with my toddler.  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] (Even if you don't talk to them much, do you think it would be worth reaching out to them?)

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hello  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hi, how are you today?  EOS 0 0 2 Oh, I'm okay. I'm just tired of everything and it has me down.  EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I see, I've been feeling that way too recently.  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Is there anything in particular that has you upset or just life in general?  EOS 0 0 5 Just life in general, I guess. I'm tired of covid. I'm tired of worrying about my mom and not going out and everything  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That makes total sense. Covid's been going on for so long, life is so different now.  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Do you want to talk about what's going on with your mom?  EOS 0 0 8 She's high risk, so we have to be careful who we come in contact with. We try to limit time in public and all that. I order groceries for pickup at walmart so i dont have to go in, and my schooling is all online so i dont have to go to class.  EOS 0 0 9 She's been fighting cancer. She's in remission now, but her immune system is still compromised and we have to be even more careful than we usually would have to be  EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it's really great that you're doing all that for her! It must be extra hard to have to limit public interactions even more than most people.  EOS 0 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] That sounds so stressful to have to be worried about her on top of everything else. I'm so sorry you're going through that.  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Have you been able to keep in contact with friends through video chat? That's something that can sometimes help when feeling isolated.  EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, we text and have group chats and stuff, and we snapchat a lot. It's been a while since I saw any of them, though. At least we have that, though.  EOS 0 0 14 And yeah, it's really stressful worrying about her. And she feels so bad because I can't see my friends or go in the store or to school  EOS 0 1 15 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you don't think the online interactions are a good substitute for in-person things. Does that sound right?  EOS 0 1 16 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, that sounds like kind of a cycle of guilt going on. Where she feels bad about you not being able to go out, and you feel bad about her feeling bad.  EOS 0 0 17 Yeah, it does. I don't need a lot of in-person interaction. I'm an introvert, so this was all just fine when it started. But even introverts need to be around people sometimes.  EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah that makes complete sense. It seems like you have a good idea of who you are and what your needs are.  EOS 0 0 19 Yes, it does seem like the cycle of guilt.... I try not to let her see how much this is affecting me, but she's my mom and she can tell...  EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] I wonder if you could do something like take walks in the park with friends, or see them with masks where you're really socially distanced from everyone 
[reference_response]	i wonder if you could do something like take walks in the park with friends, or see them with masks where you're really socially distanced from everyone

I have been feeling quite lonely too, I find myself feeling lonely at work and struggling to find someone I trust to talk to about these emotions. Do you have a friend or family member that you trust who might understand some of these feelings?  EOS 3 0 5 i do have a few friends that i think i can talk to about how i am feeling however the thought of them being too busy with their work is what prevents me from reaching out to them.  EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand. Correct me if i'm wrong, it sounds like you're nervous to open up to these trusted people because you think they might be distracted by their work to provide the empathy you need and fully understand how you are feeling. Does that sound right?  EOS 3 0 7 you know i think that you are right about this. it has always been difficult for me to open to others even with those that have been there for me when i needed someone. i feel like a mix of emotions nervous but at the same time wanting to reaching out for help  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I understand these feelings very well.

EOS 3 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I hear you. It's been a terrible year all round for job seekers, given the global situation at the moment. I have been there myself.  EOS 3 0 4 Can you give me some advice on how to cope with this? I honestly don't know what to do.  EOS 3 1 5 [Others] Well, firstly I think you need to accept that this is not your fault and that at the moment the world situation is beyond your control.  EOS 3 0 6 I understand, but still, emotionally it is hard to cope.  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Are you able to cope financially whilst you are out of work?  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps you could take on some gig work just to earn a little extra spare cash?  EOS 3 0 9 Not really, my savings are running out.

[contxt]	3 0 1 I am doing ok. How are you?  EOS 3 1 2 [Others] I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What are you seeking support for today?  EOS 3 0 3 I have been struggling for motivation to do anything the past couple weeks. This is a really hard time of year for me. I lost my cousin in a car accident at the age of 14 in a car accident coming up on 20 years this year. We were very close. I was 17 at the time. Her was an alcoholic and my parents raised her a majority of her life. Then 3 years ago 5 days after her death anniversary I lost my boyfriend at the age of 32 in a car accident. I dread the holidays.  EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you are describing a strong association between the holiday season and loss of loved ones. This leads to less of a desire to engage in typical holiday events. Does that sound right?  EOS 3 0 5 You are exactly right. The year my cousin got killed her mom was hungover so I went and picked up my cousin and her little brother to take them to our grandparents house for Christmas dinner. She died 4 days later on Dec 29th. And my boyfriend it was his first day back to work after the New Year. He died on Jan 3rd.  EOS 3 0 6 I usually go all out for the holidays to try to hide my depression every year. This year I just can't bring myself to enjoy them. I have even bought one christmas present.  EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] I can see why this time of year is difficult for you. Trying to hide depression can be a challenge. Rather than hiding the sadness or grieving feelings, some people find relief in acknowledging and sharing these feelings with family members who may relate. Do you ever share these feelings with your cousin or grandparents that you mentioned?  EOS 3 0 8 My cousin doesn't live around here and we have never been real close. He is alot younger than me. We just never had the connection like his sister and I did. And both my grandparents have passed away. Grandpa has been gone for 12 years and Grandma has been gone for 4 now.  EOS 3 0 9 My family has always been really good about talking about our loses. Things just will never be the same.  EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I understand. When losses are experienced it is a great change in many aspects of our lives. 
[reference_response]	i understand. when losses are experienced it is a great change in many aspects of our lives.
[hypothesis_response]	i am sorry to hear that, i can understand how difficult this time is. do your family have any support groups you could join to support you during this time? perhaps one of them could give you some support that you would like to share with your relatives or family members.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hi, i've been feeling really depressed lately and I'd like to talk to someone about it  EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is very understandable. Depression is tough to deal with.  EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Do you have specific things that are causing you sadness right now or is it an overall feeling of being sad?  EOS 3 0 4 It's a bit of everything. I've recently lost my job and I'm just really worried about how my bills are going to get paid. I feel so tired, you know?  EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I totally understand. Losing your job is a very rough thing to go through, I'm sorry that happened to you. Feeling constantly at red alert is taxing both mentally and physically.  EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] There is a concept called Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and sometimes I find it useful to think about if my needs are being met, and which is lacking. Which is to say, obviously financial security is your primary need at the moment, but there are other needs you must attend to as well, including your physical comforts.  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] In times of great stress and upheaval, there is only so much you can do. The rest is worry, a hamster running in a wheel, a huge output of energy that does nothing at all.  EOS 3 0 8 Yeah that makes sense but I've spent so much time thinking about my finances that I've sort of burned myself out  EOS 3 0 9 Like I have no energy even to be thankful for the other little stuff  EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] That makes sense. You sound emotionally exhausted.  EOS 3 0 11 Definitely, I feel like I could sleep forever but with my kids to worry about I don't have that option  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Gratitude is one of those things, I've found, that is self-perpetuating. Even if you begin by doing it robotically, eventually your mind and heart will want to be more sincerely grateful. I have in the past challenged myself to find five things to be grateful for in the morning and write them down. Whether those things are "I have hot coffee and electricity" or "I won $1000 for free", they will begin to start a small fire of joy. 
[reference_response]	gratitude is one of those things, i've found, that is selfperpetuating. even if you begin by doing it robotically, eventually your mind and heart will want to be more sincerely grateful. i have in the past challenged myself to find five things to be grateful for in the morning and write them down. whether those things are i have hot coffee and electricity" or i won 1000 for free", they will begin to start a small fire of joy.

I physically work hard everyday  EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand how you are feeling.  EOS 1 0 5 It makes me mad. No one says a word to him, he just sleeps and gets paid for it.  EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Has anyone else noticed him sleeping all the time at his desk?  EOS 1 0 7 My boss said (I have been there for five years) to me one day did I see DE sleeping at his desk? I was floored that it seemed he never saw him do it before. How could he not?  EOS 1 1 8 [Others] That is really weird how can someone not see him sleeping at his desk  EOS 1 0 9 Very weird. I am one of the oldest men there and I am always expected to jump in and do work that is manual labor. Very frustrating to see someone else just sleeping.  EOS 1 1 10 [Question] Have you talked to your co worker about it?  EOS 1 0 11 It really would not be my place, it would be up to my boss. He obviously said nothing.  EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] if your boss said nothing to him then maybe you should step up and say something even though you are right that is not your place  EOS 1 0 13 I keep hoping that one of the upper management team will walk by one day and see him.  EOS 1 1 14 [Information] Your boss does not sound like a good boss at all and not doing his job correctly  EOS 1 0 15 Definitely not being fair across the board, in my eyes.  EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] i feel like you should have like a serious talk to your boss about it  EOS 1 0 17 You're probably correct. I may feel better just getting it out, even if the situation does not change.  EOS 1 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don't want you feeling how you feeling because you are doing your job and you are doing everything you can to solve the problem  EOS 1 0 19 Thank you, that helps hearing that from someone.

I just found out my buddy of 20 years is now posting that he believes Trump and that the election is being stolen from him. I thought I knew him but now I don't know.  EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's a really tough thing to deal with. It can be hard to be confronted with a different, unexpected side from a trusted friend.  EOS 4 0 6 And I had this guy as my best man for my wedding  EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps you can try reasoning with him. I'm certain that your judgement in friendships is not flawed and although he has made quite the yikes choice, he still has redeemable qualities. Especially if he wasn't making his political viewpoint known until recently. It leans towards the idea that with the right information, he'll understand that Trump is a big loser and he lost lmao  EOS 4 0 8 I tried but he says that he's sick and tired of Facebook and Twitter putting a muzzle on Trump and ever since he's been on Parler he now knows the truth  EOS 4 0 9 It's like he doesn't believe science anymore  EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Consider directing him to news sources that are not Twitter or Facebook, though I know this is hard to do. it is just a teensy bit funny he thinks that Trump is being muzzled on twitter when they are not deleting any of his tweets. 
[reference_response]	consider directing him to news sources that are not twitter or facebook, though i know this is hard to do. it is just a teensy bit funny he thinks that trump is being muzzled on twitter when they are not deleting any of his tweets.

[contxt]	0 0 28 it's a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power.  EOS 0 0 29 what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me  EOS 0 1 30 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board.  EOS 0 0 31 i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment.  EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] But that is rather manipulative of you.  EOS 0 0 33 if you were me you would forget about him and the board  EOS 0 1 34 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I definitely would do that.  EOS 0 0 35 thing is he is encouraging me to be like that. cuz it helps him too  EOS 0 0 36 okay. i'll try to lay low and walk away from it  EOS 0 1 37 [Others] I think it's time for a clear severance. Do you have any other people you are interested in? Any hobbies?  EOS 0 0 38 yes but it's less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this- if that makes sense  EOS 0 1 39 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah I hear you. You feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown?  EOS 0 0 40 yes  EOS 0 1 41 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is something I believe that most of us are feeling right now so I sympathise.  EOS 0 0 42 true. i just have to be strong about it with him. even if he likes me i don't think it's a healthy relationship  EOS 0 0 43 i slept with one of his friends and the other one wanted to sleep with me too  EOS 0 1 44 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be  EOS 0 1 45 [Question] Is he aware that this happened?  EOS 0 0 46 yes when it comes down to it  EOS 0 0 47 he suspected it happened  EOS 0 0 48 his friend asked the one i slept with if it was true. he denied it. so i think he suspected it  EOS 0 1 49 [Question] Do you feel guilty about this?  EOS 0 0 50 now that im talking to him i do a little. it felt good at the time like i was getting back at him  EOS 0 0 51 you can tell this is a very twisted situation  EOS 0 1 52 [Question] Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him?  EOS 0 0 53 not really. i just felt that if he stayed with me i wouldn't have slept with his friend and almost did with his other one  EOS 0 1 54 [Others] I am not sure what to say that will help your problem and give you closure.

EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, starting with the large pot would be a great place to start! Good thinking!  EOS 0 0 10 Ok, but then what?  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Well, washing the pot will make the overall task look smaller. Then, let's pick a second type of dish to focus on. After you wash the large pot, try to focus on larger bowls, then plates and cups. You could leave the silverware for last.  EOS 0 0 12 Oh, thank you so much!

[contxt]	4 0 1 Hello, how are you doing today?  EOS 4 1 2 [Others] I am good how are you  EOS 4 0 3 I am glad you are doing well, I have been struggling lately as my girlfriend that I was going to propose to broke up with me. She told me that my career path was different then hers and she just did not see it working out.  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] How was your career path different?  EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay  EOS 4 0 6 She had a desire to do marine biology and I wanted to pursue law enforcement as a police officer, however due to my back injury that fell through recently. She would spend most of her time doing field work, which would require her to spend time out at sea. She was working in a nursing home at the time and was not a marine biologist.  EOS 4 1 7 [Information] She did not like your career path?  EOS 4 0 8 I am thinking that would be the case, however we dated for 3 years and then reconnecting about a year later which at this time was a distant relationship. She now has a boyfriend which she started date about 2 months she broke up with me. I found out that he works with her at the nursing home. I am unsure what to think, but she did say that she just didn't see how our career paths would work out and that was that.  EOS 4 1 9 [Others] If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after  EOS 4 0 11 I have had some friends echo that. I agree, it definitely felt like I was giving a lot through the time we dated. I have always wondered if this was a true statement, knowing her I think she probably got scared of what that entailed or just the distance.

[contxt]	2 0 0 Good evening  EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hi, how's things?  EOS 2 0 2 Things are ok I am just having issues with the problem above  EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I am afraid that I am not able to see that .. can you tell me about it?  EOS 2 0 4 Yes, so I have always done very well in school and university. I have always had A's or high B's. Last semester in university, I failed one of my exams. I still passed the class with an A, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams.  EOS 2 0 5 I don't know why it happens and it worries me  EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!!  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself?  EOS 2 0 8 Maybe, I got a 46% on the exam (so an F) but I did all my other assignments and exams almost perfect and got an A overall. I never once failed a test in my life, and have always held myself to a very high academic degree to make my parents proud  EOS 2 0 9 I come from a poor family, so succeeding in life is very important to m,e  EOS 2 0 10 me*  EOS 2 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life, would I be right in thinking this?  EOS 2 0 12 Yes you are correct  EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered talking to anyone about these feelings of perfectionism? A therapist perhaps?  EOS 2 1 14 [Information] There is a good deal of useful help and information out there for people who are struggling.  EOS 2 0 15 I have not, actually. I don't think my family can afford a therapist, especially with the pandemic raging right now  EOS 2 0 16 Where do you recommend going?  EOS 2 1 17 [Information] Does your school have any counsellors offering help for free? Many do.  EOS 2 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I believe that there are some charities that will offer a certain number of free therapy sessions too  EOS 2 0 19 I don't think any are available since my school is online only, also the campus i s completely closed due to Winter Break.  EOS 2 0 20 Oh? Charities?  EOS 2 1 21 [Others] Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you. 
[reference_response]	yes i think so though i am not totally sure. there should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you.

EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] Why do you think it's your body? I am sure that your body is just fine! Have you thought about taking up a hobby or activity to get your mind off of it?  EOS 4 0 6 I have thought about it, but I don't know where to start.  EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] I understand. What kinds of things do you enjoy?

I know exactly what you mean. Starting a new activity can be so hard when you aren't familiar. One thing that you might find helpful is to join in a group class at the gym. Do you think you'd like that?  EOS 4 0 10 I do have a cousin who likes to work out. That's a great idea. I should ask her. I've been pretty lonely, so it might be good to get out and meet people. Maybe a class would help me meet people too!  EOS 4 1 11 [Others] That's great! Do you know what kind of class would be of interest? I think that you have the tools to be who you want to be. It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders and I think you'll be just fine! You may even find a life long passion or friendship! You never know what is around the corner.

EOS 0 0 8 I tried, but my online rank not being where I want it gives me anxiety  EOS 0 0 9 and I keep coming back  EOS 0 0 10 Just one more match, just one more, I keep telling me  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] It sounds like you might have a genuine addiction to gaming.

EOS 0 0 14 The thing is, I keep telling myself I have enough time to get my school work done. But sooner than later I realize the assignments are already past their due date.  EOS 0 1 15 [Question] Have you been getting into trouble with your teachers about this or has no-one noticed so far?  EOS 0 0 16 Yeah, I have. They say that I am either super invested on my school work or that I lack any signs of effort at times.  EOS 0 1 17 [Question] Does your school have a counsellor?

Or maybe even get you a sick note to give you a little extra time to complete your assignment.s  EOS 0 0 12 Do you think that could hurt my grade if I turn them in late?  EOS 0 1 13 [Others] No, as long as you have a doctor's letter explaining why.  EOS 0 0 14 But I am not sick, would the counsellor write note for me under this situation?  EOS 0 1 15 [Others] There is more than one way to be sick. You sound as though you are suffering from depression and stress.  EOS 0 0 16 I guess you are right... I will try to make an appointment with the counselor next week.  EOS 0 1 17 [Question] Do you have any friends or family that you can discuss this with?

[contxt]	0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] My husband used to be very controlling as well, I dragged him to counseling. He changed. He bucked at first, but eventually he went. We have gone a few times off and on over 20 years. We both came from broken homes.  EOS 0 0 14 I haven't got 100% of the details worked out yet, but I'm trying  EOS 0 1 15 [Question] Has he hurt you physically? or is he mainly emotionally abusive?  EOS 0 0 16 He hasn't hurt me physically  EOS 0 0 17 I often feel like he would but I'm also a child abuse survivor so it's hard to tell if that's true or just a memory  EOS 0 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] I'm glad to hear that. I can understand that you would be really stressed at this time, however, I do encourage you to get a good plan in place, and definitely get counseling.  EOS 0 0 19 I think that's the best idea  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I had child abuse in my life too, I really think counseling saved our marriage, 3 times. But like, I said, he didn't want to go. However, the first time, I did leave and stay with a friend, and that convinced him I was serious.  EOS 0 0 21 that's a good thought, I wonder what he'd do if I stayed with a friend  EOS 0 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I wish I could fix this, but I can't. The road will be rocky and I don't know how I would have made it without people to encourage and support me, so I'm glad a friend is willing to have you stay with them until you can get on your feet.  EOS 0 0 23 hey may not realize I'd leave at all  EOS 0 0 24 me too, that's making all the difference  EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] My husband really loved me, but coming from a broken home, he lost his mom when he was 12, so he thought controlling me was the solution, very messed up, but he had to learn to see that.  EOS 0 0 26 definitely that makes sense  EOS 0 1 27 [Self-disclosure] He feared I would die or leave him or something, but once he saw that, and realized what he was doing was hurting me and making me want to leave, he changed. But honestly, I have never understood men and why they dont' see life the way we do. Sometimes it takes that objective person to help them see it.  EOS 0 0 28 I'm not convinced mine loves me, looking back it's beginning to seem like he was draining me for my income and labor  EOS 0 1 29 [Reflection of feelings] Ouch! That sounds painful to look at.  EOS 0 0 30 it is, I think I was super wrong about him and overlooked red flags  EOS 0 1 31 [Information] People who truly love others become willing to change. Sometimes it takes a DRASTIC measure to wake them up, like leaving. He has not heard you, so many he will "hear" it when you leave. But please be careful and have a plan.  EOS 0 1 32 [Question] How long have you been married?  EOS 0 0 33 eight years, together for 11  EOS 0 1 34 [Others] That's a long time. I will say a prayer for your safety and for you to get some help, hopefully he will join you. Marriage is a lot of work, but it can't be one person, it has to be two.  EOS 0 1 35 [Providing Suggestions] Don't leave anything in writing around until after you leave.  EOS 0 0 36 absolutely!  EOS 0 0 37 definitely no paper trail, for sure  EOS 0 1 38 [Providing Suggestions] I believe in the power of prayer too. The Serenity prayer is a good one to help me let go of my fears and do what I can, leaving the rest to God. 
[reference_response]	i believe in the power of prayer too. the serenity prayer is a good one to help me let go of my fears and do what i can, leaving the rest to god.

[contxt]	2 0 14 Ok, I think it makes sense. I may have to give it a try.  EOS 2 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] I always felt awkward and nervous looking for a job, I think I went to one interview calm and cool, in 30 years! Hahaha.  EOS 2 0 16 I am a good team player, I don't have any inter-personal or communication issues. Just that I need to be at a higher pay to reach some financial goals  EOS 2 1 17 [Others] You have nothing to lose, really, you have weighed out that there is only good things that can come, but you think you must "feel" a certain way. You don not have to feel confident, you just have to do the work. For example, you don't FEEL like walking your dog, changing a diaper or helping someone, but you DO IT anyway.  EOS 2 0 18 Cool! I will try to get motivated and start applying. Your words are just what I needed in this gloomy atmosphere.  EOS 2 1 19 [Others] Inter personal skills can be learned. I was very shy as a child and I learned how to be more friendly. And I was VERY shy.  EOS 2 0 20 Ya, I think the key is to keep my current job and start looking elsewhere.  EOS 2 0 21 Last time I made a grave mistake of quitting my job and then searching! I was very new, and over confident  EOS 2 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I'm very outgoing now. I had to learn a lot of skills to be this way and I like myself more too. Hahah. I'm old though, 59. You have nothing to lose, consider it a learning opportunity.  EOS 2 1 23 [Others] Life is a journey. We all make mistakes in the past. I think you are very intelligent actually because you thought of the pros and cons. You just needed a boost.  EOS 2 0 24 Thank you sir, I will definitely try it! You have shared Pure words of wisdom  EOS 2 1 25 [Self-disclosure] I'm a lady! I pray to God and read the Bible and get wisdom there.

I eneded up flipping all the cost and she is bad mouthing me she stood me up because she was drunk she has a drinking problem  EOS 1 0 3 not good  EOS 1 0 4 since i told her that drinking is more important to her now she is talking bad about me but she is the one with the problem.  EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are very stressed out by the situation.  EOS 1 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Have you explained to her that her excessive drinking is causing problems?  EOS 1 0 7 yes but i am the bad one she turns everything around  EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Why is she turning everything around on you?  EOS 1 0 9 she is now also spreading mean rumors about me and dragging my daughter into this  EOS 1 0 10 I do not know why, maybe so she does not have to admit that she is wrong  EOS 1 0 11 she is like a narzisist  EOS 1 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] That sounds horrible especially that she is dragging your daughter into it.

[contxt]	5 0 1 I am feeling a bit sad and down  EOS 5 1 2 [Question] I am sorry to hear that. Do you want to tell me about it?  EOS 5 0 3 I hate the way I look. Everytime I look in the mirror I cry  EOS 5 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see. Can you be more specific? A lot of people are insecure about their looks you know.  EOS 5 0 5 When I look in the mirror, I think Im the ugliest person in the world sometimes  EOS 5 1 6 [Question] How old are you if you don't mind my asking? This is a common thing among young people.  EOS 5 0 7 I am 32  EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I see. Well can you tell me what specific part of your appearance do you hate? Maybe it could be altered?  EOS 5 0 9 I hate everything when I see my reflection. I just feel fat and ugly  EOS 5 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been overweight and I know it sucks. Perhaps you could join a weight loss group?  EOS 5 0 11 I have been working out and eating better. Even though I am losing weight, I still feel horrible  EOS 5 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Well you should be proud of the progress! Maybe buy yourself some new clothes?  EOS 5 0 13 That is a good idea, maybe that will help  EOS 5 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Or have a new haircut or something :)  EOS 5 0 15 I like that idea too, I will give it a try  EOS 5 1 16 [Question] Is it just your weight that bothers you about your appearance?  EOS 5 0 17 No, I just dont like looking at myself in the mirror. I just feel ugly and gross  EOS 5 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I have a feeling that other people do not feel that way about you :)  EOS 5 0 19 That is kind of you to say, thank you  EOS 5 0 20 You have helped me quite a bit today, I appreciate it  EOS 5 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think a lot of people do see themselves in a much worse light as others see them :) It's a human thing.  EOS 5 0 22 Very true, thank you for the perspective  EOS 5 1 23 [Question] So, what sort of clothes do you think you are going to buy? :)  EOS 5 0 24 Possibly a new dress or two  EOS 5 1 25 [Self-disclosure] Sounds like a great idea. I bought a fantastic maxi dress recently. Very flattering for those of us carrying an extra pound or two  EOS 5 0 26 I love flowy dresses for that reason  EOS 5 0 27 do you do anything else when you are feeling bad about yourself?  EOS 5 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] I like a nice facemask and a bubble bath, do you?  EOS 5 0 29 I like doing my makeup and getting dressed up, even if I have nowhere to go  EOS 5 1 30 [Providing Suggestions] That is a good thing to do .. great for the self esteem. Maybe buy some new jewellery too?  EOS 5 0 31 I like the idea of pampering myself. That is something I don't do too often  EOS 5 0 32 and I need to do it more. Perhaps I will feel better then  EOS 5 1 33 [Providing Suggestions] You need to indulge yourself from time to time :) Get yourself a nice bottle of wine too. Though maybe not chocolate :D

[contxt]	6 0 1 I'm doing okay.  EOS 6 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you want to talk about?  EOS 6 0 3 I'm having problems with getting up everyday and doing my daily routine. I feel bad because these are things that other people do normally  EOS 6 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah, I've definitely felt that way...especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day?  EOS 6 0 5 Exactly. Jogging, eating breakfast, getting dressed  EOS 6 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Yep, for me it's kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just "take a break" from grinding. MTurk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy...have you been doing a lot of MTurk lately?  EOS 6 0 7 Yeah, 2020 has been a crazy year. I've been doing Mturk here and there. I plan on doing it more. It helps me stay productive.  EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah it helps, just forcing yourself to have goals, for sure. I've been determined to hit a number on MTurk and exercise every time I'm feeling tired, instead of taking a nap because my boss can't see me, lol. I would definitely say just start setting goals and try to look forward to 2021 being better.  EOS 6 0 9 Okay, I hear you. Thanks. Yeah, I guess I have to really force myself.  EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Force yourself at first, then the "body in motion, stays in motion" law will take over. :)  EOS 6 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] All I know, is that nothing is worse than ending a day without a sense of accomplishment and then stringing those kinds of days together.  EOS 6 0 12 Okay okay. cool. That's a helpful concept. I'm going to force myself to get up and then hopefully my body will get used to it. Yes, that's true. I hate ending the day knowing I've bummed it out  EOS 6 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] One of the things I've noticed about 2020 and I think this contributes is that this year has taken away almost all incentives...you know before it would be like, "I'm looking forward to this concert, or this movie coming out next weekend." So, when you aren't planning things and don't have these milestones throughout the year of events breaking up the monotony, it stinks.  EOS 6 0 14 Yes, I agree. I used to go to at least one concert every year. Now that's out of the question. It gets boring and a little depressing. Hopefully 2021 will be better.  EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I'm sure it will be. Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the MTurk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills. 
[reference_response]	i'm sure it will be. definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the mturk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills.
[hypothesis_response]	i would also love to hear the music you love and be able to go back to a new experience.

EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Anything in particular happened?  EOS 0 0 4 Just an average day if I had to describe it. Nothing particularly unusual or bad. Worked for about 8 hours and now no plans for the night  EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I get that. Some days are just meh, but nights can feel especially lonely.  EOS 0 0 6 Exactly. I find that when the night starts seeping in the loneliness comes up especially with no concrete plans or things to keep busy  EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I've felt like that too. The business of the day makes you forget, then it's time for bed and you remember.  EOS 0 0 8 And for me it's the build up to bed time. Those hours to fill with either dinner, watching tv, reading or whatever. Plenty of time let me mind wander and think the worst.  EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your day to day gets very lonely.  EOS 0 0 10 From time to time yes. I have a dog so that's nice company  EOS 0 0 11 Even then I sometimes turn to drinking to clear my mind  EOS 0 1 12 [Information] Dogs or pets in general really help to alleviate depression.  EOS 0 0 13 Yes! Something to make me feel needed and companionship knowing he's depending on me  EOS 0 1 14 [Question] I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends to talk to or groups about it you can join?  EOS 0 1 15 [Others] Exactly! Dogs really do love you no matter what. 
[reference_response]	exactly! dogs really do love you no matter what.

I am buried in cookie dough, lol, but happy and wwell.  EOS 0 0 5 That sounds like a cozy scene :)  EOS 0 0 6 I'm okay, but slightly worried about next year. My job is sort of tenuous and I have about a month to find a new role.  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Yes it is nice. Are you doing anything festive today?  EOS 0 0 8 No, nothing much. Same as always, on and off work, having a meal with the girlfriend, that sort. (It would help if this system shows us if one of us is typing..)  EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that times are rough lately. Sounds like there is some time to figure it out, take full advantage of all the time you can. I hope it works out and a new position becomes available, I know your story is shared by many right now. What a crazy time we are in  EOS 0 1 10 [Others] yes it does, on top it says inputing  EOS 0 0 11 Ah fair, that's good to know  EOS 0 0 12 Yes, still it doesn't quite help that no matter how many CVs you submit, hit rates for jobs just don't go up.  EOS 0 1 13 [Others] what are cv's? I see, I am getting by by dping a billion a day lol  EOS 0 1 14 [Question] but there is other income, im not sure it would support me otherwise. Are there other lines of work you could look into?  EOS 0 0 15 I get what you mean about other lines of work. I'm trained as an academic research associate and had to spend a few months last year working in an Amazon warehouse. I feel like I've wasted enough time outside of aimed-for career to go back to doing manual labour.  EOS 0 0 16 *this year even..  EOS 0 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] well the title sounds legit, lol, but yes i see and understand. Did you do the trainging in the warehouse for the research job?  EOS 0 0 18 No, completely unrelated jobs. It was more of a "really need a job right now" situation, and they were hiring quite unassumingly.  EOS 0 1 19 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh i see.  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] If this odd job tasks site exists maybe there a more related oppurtunites to get into that pay more. Or really, the green field is a good one to get into right now I think like solar companies and such. They are going to become more prevalent soon.  EOS 0 0 21 Are you working in such a role? I doubt my qualifications translate THAT well haha  EOS 0 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I make a good case right so you might think I was but no, I am not I only wish to be. I wish to be much more than I am but ya know I work with what I can find to do. Id savd the world every day if zi could knowing my efforts were toowrads a good cause.

[contxt]	1 0 0 Hello  EOS 1 1 1 [Others] Hi! How are you today?  EOS 1 0 2 I'm grounded so i'm not happy  EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. It must be hard.  EOS 1 1 4 [Question] Can I ask what has happened?  EOS 1 0 5 My sibling broke the tv and blamed it on me and my parents believed them  EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. That must be a hard situation, to not have your folks believe you.  EOS 1 0 7 It is very frustrating  EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Have you spoken with your sibling about why they lied?  EOS 1 0 9 No, we just got into a yelling fight about it and are both in our rooms now  EOS 1 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure it's frustrating when you know you're correct and no one believes you.  EOS 1 0 11 Yes it is  EOS 1 0 12 I'd rather just run away from everything  EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] It's not cool that you're sibling lied, but it may be a good time to breathe a second. Running away never solved anything  EOS 1 0 14 It is late at night  EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] So probably it's quiet. this is a good time to take a breath and , literally try and sleep on it.  EOS 1 1 16 [Question] What do you want to see happen?  EOS 1 0 17 that is probably a good idea. I want my sibling to be punished not me and for parents to believe me  EOS 1 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] OK, I understand.  EOS 1 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] So, then, it's how to figure out how to make that happen.  EOS 1 0 20 well my parents dont believe me so not much i can do  EOS 1 1 21 [Question] May I ask why they believe your sibling? Is your sibling a different age?  EOS 1 0 22 they are younger and the favorite  EOS 1 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand.  EOS 1 0 24 I just need to wait until I'm 18 so I can move far away  EOS 1 1 25 [Question] So, it sounds like you already have a plan to turn things around. How far away from 18 are you, if I can ask?  EOS 1 0 26 1 year  EOS 1 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] OK, good for you. It may not seem like it, but you can do anything for a year.  EOS 1 0 28 True.  EOS 1 0 29 I can't wait  EOS 1 1 30 [Question] So, the question is....how do you deal in the short term?  EOS 1 0 31 It will be nice to get away and never talk to family again  EOS 1 0 32 Just hole up in my room and not talk to anyone from now on I think  EOS 1 0 33 only talk when necessary  EOS 1 1 34 [Providing Suggestions] Yes. I was going to suggest the "grey rock" technique.  EOS 1 1 35 [Providing Suggestions] You would be only as polite as you need to be, and only engage others in a limited way. You go about your business as you need to without the involvement of your other family members.  EOS 1 0 36 That is a good idea  EOS 1 0 37 I will just do that  EOS 1 0 38 i can handle that for a year  EOS 1 0 39 thank you for your help  EOS 1 1 40 [Others] you're welcome!  EOS 1 1 41 [Others] I truly wish you the best. Stay calm, you're a stone, and will get through this until you can leave.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hi thanks for chatting with me today. I've been really down and could use someone to talk to.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Of course! What have been down about?  EOS 3 0 3 I always get sad around the holidays but this year has been so much worse because I'm spending the holidays alone.  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I'm sorry to hear that. I know being alone in the holidays can be rough.  EOS 3 0 5 All I have to do is think about how alone I am.  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have any friends or people you can set up an online zoom call with?  EOS 3 0 7 I tried that but no one that I know is tech savvy that can make Zoom work.  EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Also I feel that as well. Especially now these days its a bit hard to not think about being alone.  EOS 3 0 9 I just keep thinking about all the bad things happening in the world right now. If I had someone to spend time with I'm sure it would take my mind off of it but people aren't allowed to get together.  EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Oh how about just texting or having periodic phone calls with friends?  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah the pandemic has really stopped interactions. But that doesn't mean you can't stop talking to people completely!  EOS 3 0 12 I try that but everyone is busy with their families today. I don't have a family so I'm all alone.  EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Oh I see I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you tried doing other activities to make your mind off it?  EOS 3 0 14 I tried watching a movie but my mind starts to wander.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] For me personally doing online gaming is a great way to interact with others and have fun.  EOS 3 0 16 Maybe I'll try that. Any game suggestions?  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] What type of movie were you trying to watch? Maybe choose a happier movie than a sad one.  EOS 3 0 18 I was watching a comedy. It's a movie I usually like but I just couldn't keep my mind from wandering.  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I would recommend games like Heartstone for stragedy, WoW for more role playing and if your into sci-fi, Cyberpunk cam out recently.  EOS 3 1 20 [Information] Really any game that has multiplayer would be a good fit!  EOS 3 0 21 I like strategy games. They really make you think which helps distract you from what you don't want to think about!  EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] Oh sweet me too actually! I definitely recommend heartstone or any game that has a battle mode form  EOS 3 0 23 Thanks! I'm going to look into playing the game! That might be just what I need to bring me out of this funk!  EOS 3 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] Also I know thats its currently the holidays so maybe take your mind off right now and ask your friends later if they can talk!  EOS 3 0 25 Yes, I'm sure they'll have more free time after tomorrow!  EOS 3 1 26 [Others] I'm glad I can help! Is there anything else you would like to talk about> 
[reference_response]	i'm glad i can help! is there anything else you would like to talk about>
[hypothesis_response]	yes, that sounds like a great idea. and you can always use the free time to do anything else you like to do!

[contxt]	0 0 0 hi  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hi there, is there anything troubling you today?  EOS 0 1 2 [Others] I am happy to talk about anything you might have on your mind.  EOS 0 0 3 I got a new job in California, and all my families, mother, father, siblings and friends are there in Washington  EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch that is a very long way. So you feel that you are going to be distanced from your loved ones and might lose touch with them?  EOS 0 0 5 i need to take care of my mother and monitor my young ones  EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I know how it feels to move to another part of the country. I guess you are nervous about it and unsure if you're doing the right thing  EOS 0 0 7 yes, I need to take care of them, although the job gets a big cash  EOS 0 1 8 [Question] Would you consider relocating with you?  EOS 0 1 9 [Others] they consider, sorry.  EOS 0 0 10 and how will I cope? I know nobody over there in California  EOS 0 0 11 NO  EOS 0 1 12 [Others] It is a difficult time to be making new friends, with all the social distancing policies in place  EOS 0 0 13 IT IS ONLY MY WIFE AND CHILDREN THAT WILL FOLLOW ME  EOS 0 0 14 DEFINITELY  EOS 0 1 15 [Question] How often would you be able to visit your parents and siblings?  EOS 0 0 16 I do do that often  EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that they will still know that you love and care for them no matter how far away you are  EOS 0 0 18 but they will definitely need me  EOS 0 1 19 [Question] Are there any comparably paid jobs that you could take that do not involve moving?  EOS 0 0 20 no for now  EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I do understand that the job market is really difficult right now. Would your siblings not be able to take care of your parents though?  EOS 0 0 22 I am not sure of that men  EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Do you feel that they are not committed enough to your parents?  EOS 0 0 24 like, I am seriously worried  EOS 0 0 25 yes  EOS 0 1 26 [Others] It is very difficult to know what to say. It is a big worry and I wonder if you can be happy in your new environment if you can't be sure that what you've left behind is okay  EOS 0 1 27 [Question] Is it possible that you are worrying unnecessarily though? 
[reference_response]	is it possible that you are worrying unnecessarily though?
[hypothesis_response]	have you thought about taking a few days off of work and going to your local college? it can be a good way to get away from the stress.

[contxt]	4 1 5 [Others] remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren't right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else.  EOS 4 0 6 I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable.  EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn't want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn't mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that.  EOS 4 0 8 I trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. I thought we were so perfect together, I don't want him back I could never trust him again, I am not sure I could trust any guy right now, I am so hurt and confused. I don't ever want to feel like this again.  EOS 4 1 9 [Information] relationship issues, especially when they and suddenly can be one of the most stressful periods in an adults life. you are not alone in that other people have been through similar experiences themselves  EOS 4 0 10 This was the first guy I ever lived with, I thought we would get married one day. How do people make it through the pain, it actually hurts.  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?  EOS 4 0 12 I have a couple acquaintances at work but I wouldn't want to discuss my personal life with, my mom said to have a good cry but I almost couldn't stop once I started. He was my best friend and who I talked to once we got together I didn't seem to need anyone else which looks like a mistake now. That is why I am here for support.  EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Ok I understand. It is normal to be upset in a situation like this. When I ask if there is someone to talk to, I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup. There are also support groups out there that can really help. Getting your emotions out and seeing that others struggle with the same issue may be a very good thing.  EOS 4 0 14 Have you ever had a break up of a serious relationship or know someone who has? Does the aching inside ever get better? How long will it take?  EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] When I was younger, my girlfriend cheated on me. We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it's better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn't stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy.  EOS 4 0 16 I am sorry that happened to you but glad it turned out well in the end. You have a good point that it is better to know now than after we got married. I do have a nice neighbor who expressed concern when he noticed my boyfriend was gone. He said if I ever needed someone to talk to he was there. I thought he was just being nice. Maybe I should go talk to him some time maybe he was sincere.  EOS 4 1 17 [Information] I think that that would be a good idea! for info, In terms of how long it takes to get over it. I have read a statistic that is takes half the length of the relationship to truly get over it. Personally I think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup.

EOS 4 0 10 My father and I had a fight 2 years ago and haven't spoke since.  EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] The same happened to me, and then my father passed away. If there is anything I can say, is to swallow pride and cherish the moments you have on earth together. What was the fight over?  EOS 4 0 12 Yeah I am afraid that these things can happen. It was only over material things.  EOS 4 1 13 [Question] That was my next question, what the fight was over. Do you think he would be open to mending things?  EOS 4 0 14 It is weird because I called him out for being manipulative so this is his defense.  EOS 4 1 15 [Information] Usually when people feel singled out, they only have a few mechanisms. Unfortunately, most people tend to run away instead of fixing things. It tends to be the easier option.

EOS 3 0 4 I just had a baby 2 months ago and I have been struggling with my physical appearance and dealing with my mental health.  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Is part of that the weight gain from pregnancy? And what sort of mental health challenges are you having? Both of these problems are very common for new mothers.  EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] I'm sorry to hear you are going through this, it sounds like a very tough time for you.  EOS 3 0 7 I didnt keep much weight from the pregnancy but its the loose skin that makes it very challenging to accept and to love my self.  EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is understandable.

EOS 5 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's hard to feel like they are treating you like a number when you are working so hard. Have you talked to them about it?

EOS 5 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I had a similar experience in my college days. It was very difficult to have so much pressure to succeed and feel so alone. You can do though because you are working hard and want to succeed.  EOS 5 0 8 Thanks for the encouragement. Where do I start to help myself feel better?  EOS 5 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I see you are anxious about this when talking to you, but have you thought about getting some support from other students in your position?  EOS 5 0 10 That sounds like a good idea. Maybe they are feeling this way too.  EOS 5 1 11 [Information] Also sometimes just stepping back and taking some deep breaths can help to alleviate some anxieties. Have you tried that ever?  EOS 5 0 12 I will have to give that a try. I've done that in the past and had forgotten just how much that helped me before.  EOS 5 1 13 [Others] That is reassuring that it worked before for you and can work again.  EOS 5 0 14 I'm so worried about failing because I just don't feel the support from my professors to care either way for my successes. It's so different from high school and home when my parents encouraged me and supported me full-heartedly.  EOS 5 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] College can be quite a change from the protective atmosphere of home. Have you tried any support groups or religious groups for encouragement?  EOS 5 0 16 I am religious so perhaps I could seek a group out and they could help with encouraging me.  EOS 5 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I was a part of a religious group in college and they were very supportive even praying for me on exam days. I felt they helped me with my success by planting seeds of positive feedback to me.  EOS 5 0 18 I used to be part of one during high school years, and that sounds like it would help.  EOS 5 1 19 [Others] Are you starting to feel better about the situation?

[contxt]	4 0 0 I need support to feel ok during the pandemic  EOS 4 1 1 [Others] Hello.  EOS 4 0 2 HI there  EOS 4 1 3 [Question] What type of things are you worried about during the pandemic?  EOS 4 0 4 That I may not find a job soon which is making me depressed  EOS 4 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand, you are anxious about possibly loosing your job due to the pandemic  EOS 4 0 6 I am not working at the moment, I am looking for a job but it has been really difficult to find one  EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Have you looked into a hiring agency? They are great at helping find people jobs, especially in these hard times.  EOS 4 0 8 I have but seems like there are no entry level jobs currently and also some employers have ceased hiring  EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] After interviews have you been following up to show interest again in the job?  EOS 4 0 10 Yes I have emailed every employer where I was interviewed. Also I follow up with every hiring agency I have signed up to.  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Have you networked with any previous co-workers? They might be able to help you find something as well,  EOS 4 0 12 They all suggest to wait for a few months till things are bit normal. They also advice to keep trying.  EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you for a few I can tell this is making you very anxious/  EOS 4 0 14 Yes it indeed is  EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have also been worried recently about finding another job because of the pandemic, but I found that getting back into my hobbies has helped keep me distracted and get my mind off of it.

One of those children is a child from his previous marriage. We constantly argue about how he favors that child over our other 3.  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh no, that's not good. Do the other kids see it as well?  EOS 3 0 5 2 of the children are younger so they do not realize it but the other child is older and definitely notices.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Does your husband realize that the other child notices it and how it hurts them?

[contxt]	4 0 12 she's safe etc  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you. Things will be tough for a while, but you both will be able to grow from this experience. And just because you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, doesn't mean that you don't care about her!  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Staying friends after the fact might take the pressure off of you a little bit. You can still help her out and be there for each other, but as friends instead of partner's.  EOS 4 0 15 To be honest, it's amazing that you have suggested this. It's really hard to balance my needs and feelings without breaking her heart. It's hard for the person that's dumped but actually I think it is equally hard for the dumper!  EOS 4 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] Yes exactly! It's so difficult for the dumper as well, because of course you still have strong feelings for this person. They just aren't romantic anymore.  EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love  EOS 4 0 18 That's exactly it. So do you think I should just talk to her and tell her how I feel? The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience.  EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just "kicking her to the curb." Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard  EOS 4 0 20 Yes, I think I need to emphasize the friends element of it and potentially support her to move on. I suppose I'm fearful that it will never end but I'll need to face into that and stay strong, and obviously avoid being intimate as this would really hurt her if I continued to sleep with her. I need to be careful about that I think!  EOS 4 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, I can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it. But I think you are going to be able to do that just fine!  EOS 4 0 22 I must say, you have been fantastic to talk to about this, we have had a similar experience so I think the advice is coming from experience. Thanks for that!  EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] What I've gathered about you as a person, makes me confident that you probably chose a partner that will be able to have this talk with you and you both will come to an understanding.  EOS 4 1 24 [Others] Yes I think it's very great we were able to connect on our issues! It definitely helps. You are welcome! :)  EOS 4 0 25 Thank you for a great conversation. To continue as is wouldn't be fair on her and I see that now.  EOS 4 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Of course! And it wouldn't be fair to her, just as much as it wouldn't be fair to you. Your happiness is just as important! 
[reference_response]	of course! and it wouldn't be fair to her, just as much as it wouldn't be fair to you. your happiness is just as important!
[hypothesis_response]	thank you! i hope you two can make it through this.

EOS 0 0 5 Just feeling really bad lately. Like nothing I do is enough. Like I'm not a good mom to my kids. Like nothing I do is right.  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how you feel like you are worthless. However, I know for a fact you are NOT worthless. You were created with a purpose and a plan and God doesn't make Mistakes.

[contxt]	4 1 14 [Information] So if she manages it she can live a relatively normal life?  EOS 4 0 15 Yes, for the most part. She still gets very clumsy and can is very prone to sickness getting very bad.  EOS 4 0 16 So it has it's challenges.  EOS 4 0 17 I just keep hearing about gene therapy for that I'm just at the point where I'm not I could go on if something horrible happens.  EOS 4 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Sure, I can see where it would be challenging and pregnancy would be scary. But I'd suggest discuss it with her doctor to see what they suggest.  EOS 4 0 19 Her doctor said for her. She has to give blood work all the time...  EOS 4 0 20 Which for me is insane.  EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] As hard as it is to think about, you'd also have a piece of her  EOS 4 0 22 I would probably be a shell of a person if something happens.  EOS 4 0 23 I just always been terrified of children.  EOS 4 0 24 I keep telling her but she wants like 3 kids  EOS 4 1 25 [Others] Do you simply not want kids? Because if she does and you don't, you can't blame it on her condition, that would be making her give up something that wouldn't be fair.  EOS 4 0 26 Yeah. I try making that clear.  EOS 4 0 27 But no one wants her to die.  EOS 4 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] I understand, you may need to have a hard conversation with her.  EOS 4 0 29 I don't really have an interest for them. Maybe I'll be there and love them the same at the time. But currently. I just don't see me being feeling any sort of way later  EOS 4 0 30 Yeah. I've told her like 20 times.  EOS 4 0 31 I'm starting to think she can't process normally.  EOS 4 1 32 [Others] Maybe you're not right for each other if you have such different views on this subject. Neither one of you should have to give in to something they don't want.  EOS 4 0 33 Well it's not like I actively don't want kids  EOS 4 0 34 I just don't want her to die.  EOS 4 0 35 Or for the kids to die from something I can't control  EOS 4 0 36 I had so many siblings die  EOS 4 0 37 Seen what it did to my father. And he is not the same  EOS 4 0 38 I've been to so many funerals as a kid for young children in my family. I just don't see kids the same way anymore.  EOS 4 1 39 [Self-disclosure] Unfortunately it sounds like you've had a lot of experience with that, and I can understand that. I've been to my fair share as well. But you also can't live your life in fear or you're not really living.  EOS 4 1 40 [Self-disclosure] Unfortunately it sounds like you've had a lot of experience with that, and I can understand that. I've been to my fair share as well. But you also can't live your life in fear or you're not really living.  EOS 4 1 41 [Others] Or allowing her to live the life she wants as well.  EOS 4 0 42 I suppose that helps me cope.  EOS 4 0 43 I want her to do what she likes.  EOS 4 0 44 My mom had me out of the feeling of being lonely. And to be honest. It kind of feels like a worthless existence.  EOS 4 0 45 She literally made me stay silent about going to a baby brother's funeral when I was a kid.  EOS 4 1 46 [Reflection of feelings] Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. It sounds like you have someone who cares about you and wants a part of you to exist in another living being. I know you're scared and that's valid, but you have an opportunity to do things differently than what your mom did for you.  EOS 4 0 47 Yeah. I guess that is a better way to think. I don't want to extend that sadness to my own flesh and blood. Especially the person who values me so much.  EOS 4 0 48 The doctors trust she can do it and I know medicine is getting better.  EOS 4 1 49 [Providing Suggestions] But having gone through that yourself, you know exactly what NOT to do.  EOS 4 0 50 Everyone tells me that.

EOS 3 0 22 What I think is right might hurt other people like how people view him  EOS 3 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] okay fair enough  EOS 3 1 24 [Question] Why do you still want him even though, he broke up with you if you don't mind me asking?  EOS 3 0 25 its hard to let go of everything after all we've had  EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] it might be hard, but isn't it better to see how things go without him. It's not good to be a relationship if someone isn't 100 percent dont you agree?  EOS 3 0 27 it feels like loosing an important part of my body  EOS 3 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it might feel like that now, but in time I am sure it will change  EOS 3 0 29 but yes i am trying to just stop and leave but sometimes he calls especially when he needs help  EOS 3 0 30 and I cant not help him, and I get reminded of everything somewhere a long the way  EOS 3 1 31 [Self-disclosure] okay, in my opinion I believe its best to be strong and try and focus on yourself and live a good life without him for now, until he changes his mind then maybe you re-asses the situation.  EOS 3 0 32 Thank you will keep trying to do that.  EOS 3 1 33 [Affirmation and Reassurance] if you can't help him, its best you try and focus on yourself.

EOS 4 0 5 My friends have been leaving me out of Christmas parties. I saw on Facebook my best friend didn't invite me to his Christmas party.  EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your friends have been leaving you out of christmas parties is that correct?  EOS 4 1 7 [Others] You knew nothing about the parties?  EOS 4 0 8 Yes. My best friend didn't invite me to his party. I think its because I always wear mask and try to obey the CDC guidelines.  EOS 4 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you are feeling i would feel the same way  EOS 4 1 10 [Others] They should not be having christmas parties right now with the Covid going around bad  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would not feel bad or terrible about it because you are doing the right thing  EOS 4 0 12 Yea it just hurts being left out. He is my best friend and I am not sure what to do. I feel like I need to talk to him abou tit.  EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] yes you should talk to him about it and see why he did not invite you  EOS 4 1 14 [Information] I hope they was wearing a mask and staying 6 feet at the party  EOS 4 0 15 I saw photos and they were not wearing masks. In one way I'm glad I did not go. I also think he put a lot of people at risk. How should I bring this up?  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] I would just be straight forward and tell him you saw the photos of his christmas party  EOS 4 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Either way if you did know about the party it would not be best if you go just for your safety 
[reference_response]	either way if you did know about the party it would not be best if you go just for your safety

[contxt]	0 0 5 I had to miss my family Christmas get together yesterday as well  EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You are totally stressed out?  EOS 0 0 7 oh yeah, there was a bomb that went off in Nashville Tennessee this morning  EOS 0 0 8 Very stressed  EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you are feeling bad about not seeing loved ones.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Do you have any treadmills you can use or a gym you can access today?  EOS 0 0 11 I have a full home gym actually. I just never am motivated enough to use it lol  EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] When I am stressed, I usually take a brisk walk of 30 to 45 minutes.  EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, some exercise could help get my mind off of other things  EOS 0 1 14 [Information] They say that fresh our is really good for releasing stress. Do you have acupuncturists or holistic healers near you?  EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I try and walk and get fresh air almost daily. I love parks and paths to walk through.  EOS 0 0 16 They do but I'm not very into alternative medicine. I did relax outside for a bit though. Its very snowy and pretty here today  EOS 0 0 17 we got about an inch of now over the night  EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, shoveling can be good for releasing tension in the body by exercising by shoveling, even though it is short.  EOS 0 0 19 That's a good idea actually, I've been tracking snow in going up and down stairs, could clear a path  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] I like doing a little shoveling but you have to do it right, as to not wear out your back.  EOS 0 1 21 [Question] Do you like snow? We had a rain storm for hours on Christmas Eve. I wanted a little snow to make things look nice.  EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Are my suggestions helping any?  EOS 0 0 23 I love snow, winter is my favorite season I hate hot weather. It started christmas eve raining a ton here but it got to 15F over the night so it turned to a pretty heavy snow.  EOS 0 0 24 They are, helped take my mind off of the stuff I wass stresing over  EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] Well, there are incense pots that allow you to close you eyes and feel the glow of the meditation sticks. Certain scents can release stress. Do you have any on the home that you can burn?  EOS 0 0 26 I do have some incense sticks, I usually use palo santo sticks though  EOS 0 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have heard good things about Palo Santo sticks and rosemary / lavender oils that can calm and relax,  EOS 0 0 28 I think I have some rosemary essential oil actually  EOS 0 1 29 [Question] Do you have any music or sound effects that you can listen to as to be able to relax?  EOS 0 0 30 I do, have some music on currently  EOS 0 0 31 I love music, I'm almost always listening to something lol  EOS 0 1 32 [Providing Suggestions] I suggest rosemary oils all the time. Getting a few quaffs can calm the nerves.  EOS 0 1 33 [Providing Suggestions] Listening to calming sound effects like running creek water in the woods or dolphins communicating could put you in a good mood.  EOS 0 1 34 [Information] They say its best to stop those racing thoughts and breath in a steady pace.  EOS 0 0 35 I will definitely try out the roemary oil  EOS 0 1 36 [Question] Do you need any other insights?  EOS 0 0 37 no I think that helped.

EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Why were they cut?  EOS 0 0 7 Because of the pandemic, my boss is not generating enough money so they cut everyone's hours.

[contxt]	3 0 0 Hello  EOS 3 1 1 [Others] Hello!  EOS 3 0 2 I am not feeling very good about myself lately  EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why are you not feeling very good about yourself, lately?  EOS 3 0 4 I am a single mother, and I dont recieve any support from my childs father. I am struggling mentaly because I have no one to talk to. I have lost all of my friends since becoming a mom.  EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand how you feel. All will be well, you are going to be okay.  EOS 3 0 6 Thank you, but I feel like everyone says that.  EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, just from my understanding you are a single mom and your friends have distant from you because oh this?  EOS 3 0 8 I think the main reason ive lost my friends is because I cant go out with them or hangout anymore because I have a baby. Im not fun anymore. I had my child young so I feel like I lost out on my youth  EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like its been really tough for you and wish you had more support from your friends and even your child's father.  EOS 3 0 10 Yes, thats right. But Im having trouble accepting the fact that I have to do this alone.  EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I myself am single mum so I understand how you feel. You will find also that there are many others dealing with this issue so you are not alone  EOS 3 0 12 Can I ask, as a single mother yourself, what was something that got you through those hard times? And was it hard financially?  EOS 3 1 13 [Information] What go me through those difficult times was seeking for counselling also I had family that were very supportive and helpful. The father of my child did not pay child support at first so I took him to court eventually and he was forced to start paying child support, so financially things got better.  EOS 3 0 14 My child's father has six other children and said hes at the max on child support. I guess I wont be getting anything from him. But Ive been making it work, its definitely been hard, but Im getting some money saved to give my daughter a better life.  EOS 3 0 15 Thank you so much for talking with me today  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] What about your family members are they able to help look after your child whilst you work?

[contxt]	0 0 1 I have a friend who is an alcoholic and just can't seem to quit drinking.  EOS 0 0 2 They quit for a couple of weeks but always seem to go back.  EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that, that is a rough situation to be dealing with.  EOS 0 1 4 [Providing Suggestions] What's very important for you to know is that you cannot control another person's actions.  EOS 0 0 5 It is. I care for them a great deal and do not like to see them this way.  EOS 0 0 6 I just do not know how to help them anymore.  EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It's difficult for those close to an alcoholic to watch them destroy themselves.  EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I will tell you that you can only take care of yourself. And you can only be honest with them about how their actions affect you.  EOS 0 0 9 He is a wonderful person when he isn't drinking, but is argumentative when they drink  EOS 0 0 10 I do, we have talked over and over about how this affects both of us. And he cares when he is sober, but it doesn't seem to be enough to keep him from going back.  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] You may need to take some time away from the friendship then. To show him you are serious that you can't tolerate the behavior any longer.  EOS 0 0 12 I get that, but I am the person closest to him and he needs my support  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] That's understandable. But if you continue trying the same solution over and over again, but are getting the same result...  EOS 0 0 14 true, but I do not think that not being here would help. it would only hurt him  EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] In that case, you should be sure to shore up your defenses and be prepared, because it will be hard. You are a good friend, but don't lose yourself to save him.  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Consulting some literature for friends and family of alcoholics may be useful as well, Al-Anon or something like that.  EOS 0 0 17 That is a good idea. I do worry that he would be upset if I shared this with others he might know  EOS 0 0 18 He is a really sweet person and worth the effort to help.  EOS 0 0 19 he had a lot to give.  EOS 0 0 20 has  EOS 0 1 21 [Others] You should be able to find online Al-Anon groups, too.  EOS 0 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure he does. Don't forget that you do as well.  EOS 0 0 23 I had not thought of that. I thought you had to go to the meetings and that would be hard for me to do.  EOS 0 0 24 I will definitely look into that! I appreciate the suggestion!  EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] It looks like they do offer online chats: http://al-anon.org/al-anon-meetings  EOS 0 0 26 And thank you for saying that I have things to give, I forget about myself in this sometimes  EOS 0 0 27 Thank you so much for that information. I had no idea!  EOS 0 1 28 [Others] So much like this chat here, you wouldn't even have to give your real name, nothing identifying, just support for you. Supporting an alcohol is exhausting, and you will need resources.  EOS 0 1 29 [Others] And a place to vent. 
[reference_response]	and a place to vent.

[contxt]	4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I think it's great that we got matched up, because I went through also the exact same situation. My boyfriend and I were long distance, and he moved across the country to be closer to me. So when I felt like we needed to break up, I was experiencing similar guilt that you are experiencing.  EOS 4 0 11 It's great that you understand this. I think being the man puts more pressure on me to look after her and make sure she  EOS 4 0 12 she's safe etc  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you. Things will be tough for a while, but you both will be able to grow from this experience. And just because you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, doesn't mean that you don't care about her!  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Staying friends after the fact might take the pressure off of you a little bit. You can still help her out and be there for each other, but as friends instead of partner's.  EOS 4 0 15 To be honest, it's amazing that you have suggested this. It's really hard to balance my needs and feelings without breaking her heart. It's hard for the person that's dumped but actually I think it is equally hard for the dumper!  EOS 4 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] Yes exactly! It's so difficult for the dumper as well, because of course you still have strong feelings for this person. They just aren't romantic anymore.  EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love  EOS 4 0 18 That's exactly it. So do you think I should just talk to her and tell her how I feel? The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience.  EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just "kicking her to the curb." Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard  EOS 4 0 20 Yes, I think I need to emphasize the friends element of it and potentially support her to move on. I suppose I'm fearful that it will never end but I'll need to face into that and stay strong, and obviously avoid being intimate as this would really hurt her if I continued to sleep with her. I need to be careful about that I think!  EOS 4 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, I can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it. But I think you are going to be able to do that just fine!  EOS 4 0 22 I must say, you have been fantastic to talk to about this, we have had a similar experience so I think the advice is coming from experience. Thanks for that!  EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] What I've gathered about you as a person, makes me confident that you probably chose a partner that will be able to have this talk with you and you both will come to an understanding.  EOS 4 1 24 [Others] Yes I think it's very great we were able to connect on our issues! It definitely helps. You are welcome! :) 
[reference_response]	yes i think it's very great we were able to connect on our issues! it definitely helps. you are welcome! : )

[contxt]	1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You sound as if you are in a slump. I've been there. Perhaps defining the problem and some solutions can help?  EOS 1 0 5 Perhaps - i dont know the solution. the problem is I cannot continue to work these hours - it is just not sustainable.  EOS 1 1 6 [Question] What are your hours?  EOS 1 0 7 like generally, or currently in these situations? usually its around 9-5 (give or take). These days its 9 - 7 or 11pm or later.  EOS 1 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I have to say, when I am physically and mentally exhausted, I don't think as clearly and lose hope more easily.  EOS 1 0 9 right, and that is the issue of where I am at.  EOS 1 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] 9 to 11 would exhaust me. That is 14 hours?  EOS 1 0 11 yeah - something like that. and lunches are at the desk - as i am working from home - so its pretty much no breaks either.  EOS 1 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I would certainly agree with you. That kind of work is unsustainable. Let me ask you this. What would happen if you told your employer you simply could not do these hours?  EOS 1 0 13 hah - i dunno. im on a team of 2 people - and i guess if i dont do it, the other person has to. or it just doesnt get done, and i dont know what happens?? nothing? LOL.  EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] The worst that could happen is that they fire you. But that doesn't seem too likely as they seem to need you. But I have learned in life that if I don't care for myself, hardly anyone does. We need to be kind to ourselves. Set boundaries.  EOS 1 0 15 agreed - i dont think they would fire me, maybe get reprimanded or more likely a guilt trip as to why I cant do it. Im just not sure what kind of boundaries I set when we have things due, and just literally no time.  EOS 1 1 16 [Information] Setting boundaries can be difficult if you haven't done that a lot. When we think we don't have the ability to say NO, then we feel trapped, worn out, depressed, taken advantage of. People need to know that we reasonably can say no.  EOS 1 0 17 Well, I have to set boundaries, because working till 11pm most nights is not sustainable. and who on earth is going to view, let alone sign a contract at 12am  EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I think that would be the first step. Determine how many hours you feel you COULD work. Then advise them that is what you will do. Find out what kind of timelines there are, and if you can't do it, don't go beyond your boundaries. It is obviously destroying your life. It really isn't healthy for you.  EOS 1 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] Exactly. It isn't working for you. Something has to change. And you sound intelligent, so you can determine what will work for you -- perhaps a range of hours, but definitely not 14 hours. Unless you are a young kid. lol Even then, that's a lot.  EOS 1 0 20 yeah - ill come up with reasonable boundaries till 5:30 is reasonable, and if its a do or die situation cap it at 7:30 --- and thats only for dire situations. if that doesnt work, well then i guess either i dont have a job, or people figure out how to work in regular hours.  EOS 1 1 21 [Others] That sounds reasonable to me. And if they try to make you feel guilty, reject that. Tell them, I'm sorry, but I feel this is reasonable, and truly it is. 
[reference_response]	that sounds reasonable to me. and if they try to make you feel guilty, reject that. tell them, i'm sorry, but i feel this is reasonable, and truly it is.
[hypothesis_response]	i think you have a lot of options. you can set a time for yourself, and set it off for others.

EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Did something happen to trigger this for you? Or did it just kind of start without an explanation?  EOS 4 0 5 My kids started online learning in their respective rooms during the day. One day they both came running to me after about 3 days of school asking me for various things that kids do. They were only coming to me and my husband sort of participated in the beginning but now he is falling back the last few months and it has taken a toll on our relationship.  EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Correct me if I'm wron g, your children are now online learning, and you are feeling defeated because your husband is pulling away and not providing you the support you need?

They are great at helping find people jobs, especially in these hard times.  EOS 4 0 8 I have but seems like there are no entry level jobs currently and also some employers have ceased hiring  EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] After interviews have you been following up to show interest again in the job?  EOS 4 0 10 Yes I have emailed every employer where I was interviewed. Also I follow up with every hiring agency I have signed up to.  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Have you networked with any previous co-workers? They might be able to help you find something as well,  EOS 4 0 12 They all suggest to wait for a few months till things are bit normal. They also advice to keep trying.  EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you for a few I can tell this is making you very anxious/  EOS 4 0 14 Yes it indeed is  EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have also been worried recently about finding another job because of the pandemic, but I found that getting back into my hobbies has helped keep me distracted and get my mind off of it.  EOS 4 0 16 It is very difficult to stay home doing nothing, it is very upsetting  EOS 4 0 17 I have started to paint which I have always enjoyed doing but again when I see others close me work and settled it makes me feel sad that I don't have a job  EOS 4 1 18 [Others] I think painting more would be very helpful!

[contxt]	1 0 0 Hello.  EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hi there, How are you doing today?  EOS 1 0 2 I am angry today.  EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Would you like to go into the reasons for why you are angry?  EOS 1 0 4 I guess. I have a friend that is being really annoying and dismissive. I feel like they're not being a good friend.  EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Do they act this way often?  EOS 1 0 6 Not really, we were talking recently and she just didn't really want to hear my opinion and talked over me. Normally she's pretty good at listening.  EOS 1 1 7 [Information] Well, everyone, including yourself, is entitled to an off day. Maybe something is going on with her she doesnt want to share. Or possibly even she is trying to share but doesnt know how.  EOS 1 0 8 I guess that could be the case.  EOS 1 0 9 What should I do then?  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps try to reach out and see if anything is wrong.  EOS 1 0 11 So I should just ask her if something is going on?  EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I would remember though, its ok for people to want to be left alone though if things are bad, sometimes they just need their space.  EOS 1 0 13 Ok, that makes sense, I can get like that.  EOS 1 0 14 What if something isn't wrong though?  EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I would just say something along the lines of: Hey, youre not acting like yourself today, anything you want to talk about?  EOS 1 1 16 [Information] I would see if there is anything you can do to help, if not just try and be as supportive as you can.  EOS 1 0 17 Ok, that sounds like a good plan. I'm just a little worried that it won't work because she was acting really rude. So I feel like I don't really want to talk to her right now.  EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Well, youre own health and well being does come first. If you feel it wont get anywhere, give her some space and come back to it at another date if you think you both would be comfortable with it.  EOS 1 0 19 Okay. I think that sounds good. I'll give myself and hopefully her some time to calm down and then maybe ask if she want's to talk?  EOS 1 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a solid plan.  EOS 1 0 21 Thank you for helping! I feel a lot less upset and like I have an actual plan.  EOS 1 0 22 You really helped me see that something could be going on with her that made her act so rude.  EOS 1 1 23 [Others] I am glad i could help!  EOS 1 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] Yeah, everyone including me, forgets that each individual has their own sets of things going on each day.

It's stressful enough with less money, but coming up on Christmas is just giving me even more anxiety about it.  EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just so I make sure I understand, you are currently stressed about your money situation due to only working part time making deliveries for the time being.  EOS 0 0 7 Yes  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I can completely understand this, as I was also extremely worried about money when the pandemic first started and about not being able to be employed.

EOS 1 0 7 They won't take a compromise. parents are stubborn. What should i do? please parents or pursue my passion?  EOS 1 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I cannot tell you what to do exactly, but I would encourage you to fulfill yourself before anyone else's dictation of your life.  EOS 1 0 9 Yeah i'm leaning that. i already graduated university. i fulfilled half of their dream. you think telling them my honest opinion will be a good idea?

I had a rocky relationship with my dad after college too, but it's better now. They will survive, and you will thrive.  EOS 1 0 13 Thank you. yeah i get that. but they should be happy for me. They cant make decisions for me all the time. let me free!!!  EOS 1 1 14 [Information] That feeling is totally understandable, I felt the same way. They need to let you find your own way, it's apart of growing up.  EOS 1 0 15 Thank you. at least someone agrees with me. Do i have the right to be angry at them?  EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] The anger is understandable, but I think it is slightly misplaced as they are not trying to hurt you. You are frustrated by their lack of understanding and their judgement of your choices, but you and they are both attempting to solve the same problem of your happiness.  EOS 1 0 17 Good advice. you are great at this.  EOS 1 1 18 [Others] That's very kind of you to say, thank you :-)

EOS 2 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] not being able to go anywhere is hard. we are all feeling that right now. is it that you are feeling money woes or being cooped up - which bothers you most?

EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] indeed. you mentioned that the salary you are getting doesn't cover everything. is it not covering houseing expenses?

I doubt my qualifications translate THAT well haha  EOS 0 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I make a good case right so you might think I was but no, I am not I only wish to be.

EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that. An investigation on who? you?  EOS 1 0 5 Me and my manager. She feels that we are targeting her.  EOS 1 1 6 [Information] That's unfortunately. Have you talked to someone in upper management about this?  EOS 1 0 7 I have talked to him about past issues with her but not this most recent. I'm trying to give myself some time to talk to him because I'm still very angry and don't want to talk with so much emotion  EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] That is understandable. People can be hard to deal with at times. What did the co-worker do that upset you?  EOS 1 0 9 We have a set process of how we are to screen employees as they enter the workplace. She doesn't follow the procedures or makes up her own way to do them because she is lazy to either stand up or greet them. She is also rude at times to customers and has an attitude that is not friendly.  EOS 1 1 10 [Question] Oh, that's unfortunate. Have you brought this issue to upper management in the past?  EOS 1 0 11 I have and so my manager sent a general memo reminding employees about our standard operating procedures. And from that memo, she thinks it's only about her and that we are discriminating against her.  EOS 1 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sorry to hear.

[contxt]	5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand, you are struggling with dealing with ending a long term relationship with your child's father.  EOS 5 0 5 Exactly right, after 15 years and 4 kids, he cheated on me and the affair produced a child.  EOS 5 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I am so sorry to hear that. My ex-fiance cheated on me and got pregnant with another man, so I know how rough this type of thing is.  EOS 5 1 7 [Question] Have you been able to talk to him about it yet?  EOS 5 0 8 At this point, I don't want to talk, I am so disgusted I want nothing more to do with him, regardless of the kids.  EOS 5 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Have you talked to the kids about it? It will be important for them to understand what is going on and why.  EOS 5 0 10 The kids are pretty smart, they found out and was mad at first, but now they are accepting, which is making me even more disgusted. I have even started to resent my kids for it.  EOS 5 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I think it would help to sit down and have a conversation with them about it. It is important that they know how you feel and that you are there for them, and that they aren't the reason for the issues.  EOS 5 0 12 I did at least sit down with the kids about it, told t hem how I felt, explained the nature of the situation. But they weren't on my side, they acted like they were on my side at first but then switched up on me, made me feel like I was the one wrong!?!  EOS 5 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about seeking a group of people who have been through this same situation that you are going through now? It often helps to talk to people who have been through the same things and get their help to get through the situation.  EOS 5 0 14 Apparently that's you smh lol.. How did you feel? What did you do?  EOS 5 1 15 [Self-disclosure] This is true I suppose. I made sure to have a conversation with her first in order to get some closure on the situation. After that I focused on more of my hobbies that I hadn't been able to do in a while in order to keep my mind distracted and off of the situation.  EOS 5 0 16 I'm still not ready to have that conversation with him. He's acting like I made him cheat on me. Maybe I should find some hobbies to distract myself until I can myself to that point.  EOS 5 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I think that would definitely help!  EOS 5 1 18 [Question] What are some things you like to do?  EOS 5 0 19 How do I deal with my feelings of disgust?  EOS 5 0 20 I like to color, I like to read, I like to do puzzles.  EOS 5 1 21 [Others] You have to know that it wasn't your fault. He was the one who was unfaithful and there is nothing that you did to cause that. This was something I had to keep telling myself as I was trying to process everything. Sometimes it isn't easy, but you are your own biggest supporter. It wasn't your fault.  EOS 5 0 22 That definitely gave me some strength and closure, thank you so much!  EOS 5 1 23 [Others] Not a problem at all!

EOS 4 0 8 We were at school (our college campus), and we had a huge fight.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run.  EOS 4 0 10 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don't know what to do with myself.  EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation.  EOS 4 0 12 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately.  EOS 4 0 13 That's true, but that doesn't make me feel any better about it right now.

EOS 4 1 25 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds?  EOS 4 0 26 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick.

EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just so I make sure I understand, you are currently stressed about your money situation due to only working part time making deliveries for the time being.  EOS 0 0 7 Yes  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I can completely understand this, as I was also extremely worried about money when the pandemic first started and about not being able to be employed.  EOS 0 0 9 It's so hard to find something else right now.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Have you looked into hiring agencies to help you find a more permanent job during the pandemic?

[contxt]	4 0 0 Hi, how are you?  EOS 4 1 1 [Others] Hi there! I'm great, what about you? How can I help today?  EOS 4 0 2 My girlfriend dumped me for someone else! I've been really shook up.  EOS 4 1 3 [Question] I'm so sorry to hear that :( Do you have any idea why?  EOS 4 0 4 I think she just lost interest in me? It happened a couple of months ago. I wish I could get over it. I can't get her off my mind. She's dating this total loser.  EOS 4 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That's tough... so you're saying that you grew apart a little? Or do you think it was more one-sided?  EOS 4 0 6 It probably was more me than her. Maybe I should have done more to show her that I cared for her. Am I not romantic enough? Some guys just aren't that way.  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I completely understand, and I don't think you should beat yourself up over it!  EOS 4 0 8 That's a fair point. I shouldn't be too hard on myself. I didn't really grow up in a romantic family. I don't know how to do that stuff, but maybe I could learn.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Exactly, and remember everyone is different, perhaps you just weren't her right one, and that can go both ways.  EOS 4 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Do you want to improve for her? or for yourself do you think?  EOS 4 0 11 That's true. I really got hung up on her. I thought she was perfect and that we were perfect together. She didn't see it that way. I can't really change who I am, and she couldn't change who she is.  EOS 4 0 12 I don't know if I can change myself for her. Maybe there is something basic that she wants that I just don't have? I should probably change for future relationships.  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's a great line of thought, its good that you're able to identify that yourself  EOS 4 0 14 What do you think I could do to improve myself?  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I suggest that you stay exactly the way that you are. I feel like you'd be happier that way and also more likely to find someone who shares the same values as you

[contxt]	3 0 0 hi there  EOS 3 1 1 [Others] Hello! How are you doing?  EOS 3 0 2 I'm not doing so good at the moment. I'm feeling very stressed and burned out from work  EOS 3 1 3 [Information] That sounds very frustrating. Is this a recent development at your job?  EOS 3 0 4 It's been building up for a while now, but it's really starting to get a but overwhelming  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] I can understand how that can have an effect on your mental well-being. Have you spoken to your supervisor about your frustrations at work?  EOS 3 0 6 I have, but sometimes I feel like she doesn't really listen and she sort of talks over me a lot  EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you don't feel listened to.  EOS 3 0 8 That's right... I guess that is quite a lot of the problem.  EOS 3 0 9 I don't mind so much the work, I know it is busy for everyone right now, it's a combination of the workload plus not being listened to  EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I had a similar issue at my last job. My supervisor constantly spoke over me in meetings, and it would drive me crazy. I never could get a word in edge-wise.  EOS 3 0 11 Yeah, that sounds a lot like what I am experiencing  EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Are you considering switching jobs? 
[reference_response]	are you considering switching jobs?

[contxt]	0 0 0 I'm so anxious. I'm losing my job at the end of the month and I don't know how my resume is going to hold up with so many other people looking for work too!  EOS 0 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand why you would feel this way. Maybe you should try to take a step back and reassess the situation.  EOS 0 0 2 Maybe, but it's hard to feel like there is another way to approach it. There's so many people struggling. It's all so sad and scary right now.  EOS 0 1 3 [Providing Suggestions] It may be a good time to go over your resume, making sure to fine tune all of your achievements and qualifications. This may help ease some of your worries and fears.  EOS 0 0 4 Wow, that's a great idea.  EOS 0 0 5 Hmm. But what if I spend the fee to get my resume looked at but then don't land a job? Wouldn't it be better to save the money and hedge my bets?  EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems that you are mixed up in the decision to put in extra funds in a professional resume polish or use your time and energy instead of actual financial means. Is that right?  EOS 0 0 7 Exactly. I'm anxious that if I don't get professional help I won't land a job but then on the other hand I'm anxious that if I don't get a job I'll have needed the savings.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Perhaps you should speak to a trusted mentor or a closed loved one and seek their opinion. Often, we need someone outside of the actual situation that can give us great advice.  EOS 0 0 9 That's a good idea too. Maybe even someone who recently changed jobs can give me some interview tips! -Even if I get the interview I know I'm going to be anxious about that!  EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand we can all feel anxious during an interview, but remember what great qualities you can bring to the table and believe in yourself!  EOS 0 0 11 I'll try! Thank you so much for the advice!  EOS 0 1 12 [Information] Also, there are many online resources that are great at finding available jobs and require your time and effort, but not any money invested. This might be a good tool as well!

EOS 3 0 5 Chat would be ok  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Ok. What do you want to chat about  EOS 3 0 7 I am not sure  EOS 3 1 8 [Others] No you are uncertain about the chatting, what can we chat about  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes it helps to just talk.  EOS 3 0 10 I can't wait to be over this cold and leave the house  EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Cold as in the bug or weather  EOS 3 0 12 Sick. But the weather is also cold  EOS 3 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am in a southern state and it is chilly.  EOS 3 1 14 [Question] Where about are you from  EOS 3 0 15 Northeast Ohio so it tends to be cold and gross up here  EOS 3 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] I can imagine especially with the storm hitting  EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am in Georgia and the air is chilly  EOS 3 0 18 I'm definitely not prepared for the storm. It can be so hit or miss what they actually bring  EOS 3 1 19 [Question] Are you in the path of the storm  EOS 3 1 20 [Others] At least you are away from the east coast. They are going to get hit hard.  EOS 3 0 21 I am but I dont think it is supposed to be as bad by us. We are on the edge of it I think New York is supposed to get like two feet of snow  EOS 3 1 22 [Question] How much snow do you normally receive  EOS 3 0 23 Normally when we get a storm it's only about 3-6 inches. I work further north though and it can get pretty bad sometimes  EOS 3 1 24 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The direction shows heading towards New England and east coast. Ohio does not seem to be in the path.  EOS 3 1 25 [Question] Are you close to the lake  EOS 3 0 26 It may have changed since I checked. They said we were going to get a bit of it. I'm about an hour from the lake but for work we have stations in Cleveland, Geneva, and Ashtabula that are on the lake and it gets crazy  EOS 3 1 27 [Others] The northern part is near Erie  EOS 3 0 28 Yep and it gets the lake effect snow and sometimes there isn't even a storm. Just if it is windy and cold  EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The lake effect snow is harder than the regular snow at times,  EOS 3 0 30 It can be so sudden that its hard to keep up with and the roads are a mess  EOS 3 1 31 [Self-disclosure] I am from upstate New York and it can get nasty when it comes across the lakes 
[reference_response]	i am from upstate new york and it can get nasty when it comes across the lakes

[contxt]	6 0 0 Hello.  EOS 6 1 1 [Others] Hello! How are you doing today?  EOS 6 0 2 I'm not doing very well unfortunately.  EOS 6 0 3 I failed my college finals, and now I'm up for Academic Probation.  EOS 6 1 4 [Question] I am so sorry to hear that, I'd love to understand more about what you are struggling with?  EOS 6 0 5 I'm almost near gradution too.  EOS 6 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Academic probation does seem very scary. When did you learn you failed your finals?  EOS 6 0 7 I learned yesterday. Because of the pandemic the semester is shorter.  EOS 6 1 8 [Others] And how long do you have until graduation?  EOS 6 0 9 I should be graduating in June.  EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I see. Well it's nice that we matched up! I actually work at a college and now a couple good strategies to get off academic probation, and or avoid it! What is it you are studying?  EOS 6 0 11 You're a great resource then! I am majoring in Psychology with a minor in Biology.  EOS 6 1 12 [Others] Oh that is awesome! So when do you find out whether or not you are on probation?  EOS 6 0 13 Likely in the next week.  EOS 6 0 14 I registered for my classes for next semester but I think I should drop my minor. \  EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Okay gotcha. Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health  EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] I also recommend making an educational plan. Although it can seem scary and long to see your goals directly laid out in front of you, it really helps with motivation  EOS 6 0 17 That's great advice and likely would be my best option.  EOS 6 0 18 I will definitely do that. I feel better hearing that it's okay to drop my minor. I felt like a failure when I considered it.  EOS 6 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] From talking with you so far, I can tell that you are stressed about this. But I want to reassure you that your mental health should always come first. It is the most important thing you can do.

But they not.  EOS 3 0 8 It creates depression on my mind  EOS 3 0 9 I cannot concentrate on any other works  EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] it seems to me that you feel you can not trust a friend, correct me if im wrong?  EOS 3 0 11 I trust my friends very much. They won't show the same trustfulness on me.  EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Oh ok, have you asked them why they feel they can not trust you?  EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe you could have a conversation about it and see what you could do to gain their trust.  EOS 3 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have had a friend not to trust me and i know how hurtful that can feel, maybe there has just been some sort of misunderstanding.  EOS 3 0 15 They think I am not suitable for some places. They want to go that places without my knowledge is not a problem. But they hide the total matter  EOS 3 0 16 It may be misunderstanding. I tried to talk with them.  EOS 3 0 17 They won't respond to me  EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Could it be that it is not that they do not trust you but they feel you would not feel comfortable going to such places?  EOS 3 0 19 If they feel uncomfortable , they could speak directly but they won't did that also  EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry you feel ignored sometimes people choose to ignore issues rather than confront them and try to come to some sort of solution, i would try not to take it to personnel as you seem like a very friendly person.  EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] You could try to send a message just stating that your feelings are hurt and it would be nice if they would at least reply back with a explanation on why they have made you feel this way.  EOS 3 0 22 Can you any idea to get out from this?  EOS 3 1 23 [Question] Are you asking how to end the chat?  EOS 3 0 24 no  EOS 3 0 25 how to get out from my depression?  EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] I think you need to spend some time doing something you enjoy to try to take your mind off of it, maybe go to a movie or for a nice walk.  EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions] Or if you have a family member you are close to you could speak to them about it and see what the perspective of the situation is.  EOS 3 0 28 Thank you my dear.  EOS 3 0 29 I got a little bit idea  EOS 3 0 30 I will try to explore it  EOS 3 0 31 is there any general way to get out from stress?  EOS 3 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] No problem you really seem like a nice person so i think the problem more so is with them and not you so try not to let it ruin your holiday season!  EOS 3 1 33 [Self-disclosure] When i am stressed or depressed I like to workout and listen to music.  EOS 3 0 34 I like to read book. Shall I try this?  EOS 3 1 35 [Providing Suggestions] Yes getting lost in a good book is a great way to get your mind off of it!  EOS 3 0 36 Thank you friend. Shall we end the chat?

[contxt]	0 0 1 a bit concerned as I am afraid that my job will let go more staff like they did a couple months ago  EOS 0 1 2 [Information] Ah im sorry to hear that. Best advice i can give is to play for exactly that.  EOS 0 0 3 I am afraid id they let more people go I may be let go as well.  EOS 0 1 4 [Providing Suggestions] Like maybe get your resume cleaned up, cast some lines out for employment now, checked linkdin, worst come to worst, make sure you know how to fill out unemployment for the future.  EOS 0 1 5 [Information] If you have a plan already it will ease some of that anxiety that will come from this tough situation  EOS 0 0 6 At my age, i fo not want to look for another job, i prefer to stay at this job until I retire. So that makes me anxious  EOS 0 1 7 [Information] Unfortunately, life doesnt always do what we want. What we can do is plan ahead though. It will make you less anxious if you know you have a back up plan.  EOS 0 0 8 I hate the thought that i may have to start over  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] I know that is a really rough thing to go through. Do you have anyone at home you can talk to as well? Just letting it out helps sometimes.  EOS 0 0 10 No, I do not, but I can call a friend  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] It might make you feel a bit better, maybe they can give you some perspective as well.  EOS 0 0 12 I did talk to a friend and that made me feel a little better, but only for a while  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Its not something that will go away instantly, its something you have to work at. If it is really affecting your life in a negative way, talking to a therapist might really help you.  EOS 0 0 14 OK, that sounds like a good idea.  EOS 0 1 15 [Others] Im glad you think so  EOS 0 0 16 I will try that and see if my anxiety go away.  EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Im glad, before then, what helps me calm down is going for a nice hike or run. It really lets me clear my head. Do you have anything you like to do to recenter yourself?

EOS 1 0 5 I want to get a qualification but I'm working full-time at the moment and I also work very long hours. the problem is the courses that I want to do a huge time commitment. I'm really angry that I can't seem to get better qualifications to improve my life, because I need to work and need the income to keep me going. I feel stuck and don't know how to get past this.  EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Working and going to school can be tough. It must be very stressful.  EOS 1 1 7 [Question] Maybe you can take less classes or hours at work?  EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Or what are some ways you can relax after a long day?  EOS 1 0 9 you are right this is very stressful. I've gotten used to the steady income and now we lie on it. the problem is I do work quite late hours so have limited time to study. any suggestions?  EOS 1 1 10 [Others] I would ask for lesser hours if you can or study during your lunch breaks.  EOS 1 0 11 Perhaps I can ask for a different shift pattern yes, or reduce my hours. I may need to take a look at my finances and do a bit of recalculating. Have you ever had a situation like this?  EOS 1 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I have not but I know people who are in your situation.  EOS 1 0 13 I wonder if there are courses and qualifications that you can get just by studying maybe an hour a day or an hour every other day?  EOS 1 1 14 [Information] I would look on sites like Skill share.  EOS 1 1 15 [Information] You can learn a lot on there  EOS 1 1 16 [Information] There maybe some free courses to but I'm not sure  EOS 1 0 17 ok I've never heard of skillshare, is that a website where you can get more information about work based qualifications etc?

EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Pretty much sums it up really. I think that that is how a lot of us are feeling right now. Is there anything you'd like to talk about?  EOS 4 0 4 I have been getting migraines lately which is not fun.  EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Ouch I hear you .. I have suffered from those for years. They are no fun at all are they?  EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Are you getting any sort of treatment for it? There are some effective treatments out there.  EOS 4 0 7 I actually just talked to my doctor today, I am going to track my triggers and see if we can figure out why I am getting them. Also some meds for the symptoms.  EOS 4 1 8 [Question] That sounds really productive. Do you think that the attacks might be stress related in some way?  EOS 4 0 9 It could be but they seem to happen more on weekends so that doesn't really make sense.  EOS 4 1 10 [Question] Hmm yes I can see how that does not make any sense. Do you have any other medical issues?  EOS 4 0 11 No I am in pretty good health, a bit of sciatica from a few years back but that only flares up occasionally.  EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I believe that there are some new advances in migraine treatment at the moment so I think things will improve for you. I am sorry if I am not being more help.  EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] You sound as though you are dealing with the problem pretty well though  EOS 4 0 14 Thanks I knoq its pretty hard to fix medical issues with a conversation, I am also a little depressed if that helps:)  EOS 4 1 15 [Question] Ah I hear you on that. Do you feel that this is related to the pandemic or is it something that has been ongoing for a while? 
[reference_response]	ah i hear you on that. do you feel that this is related to the pandemic or is it something that has been ongoing for a while?

[contxt]	4 0 1 Not too well, I am feeling very sad this holiday season.  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am sorry to hear that you are feeling sad this holiday season. Why are you feeling sad?  EOS 4 0 3 My girlfriend left me for my best friend, now I have no one in my life.  EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I see, this sounds really difficult. How long were you dating your girlfriend? Do you have any friends, family or a support system by chance?  EOS 4 0 5 We were together for 7 years. I have no family. My friend and girlfriend were my only family, we were like the Gatsbys.  EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] That is a very long time, I had a girlfriend and I was very vested in her and her family. She broke up with me around Christmas time as well. It has been awhile, but I remember getting her gift and it was over sometime afterwards. Do you have any co-workers or involvement with any local groups/organizations/church?  EOS 4 0 7 My co-workers don't know about my personal life, I don't go to church. Maybe I should go see a therapist?  EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I think a therapist would be a great way to process this situation since our time is limited. From what you shared, it sounds like you have some past hurts that you may want to share with someone you trust. Do you have insurance or are you uninsured? There are great therapist for the insured and uninsured. :)  EOS 4 0 9 I do not have insurance, I am between jobs and have nothing currently. The holidays are an especially lonely time.  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I see, that is very difficult. This season bring many feeling like this myself. If you had a magic wand and could change anything about your situation, what would you change assuming that we cannot fix this situation per se.  EOS 4 0 11 I would treat my girlfriend better I think. She was pushing for a threesome with my best friend, but I told her no way. That is why she left me.  EOS 4 1 12 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] From what I am hearing, it sounds like you have a boundary and your girlfriend did not respect that. I think you deserve someone that respects you and your boundaries. If you do not feel comfortable, then you do not feel comfortable and should not be shamed for it.  EOS 4 0 13 I agree. She made me watch them have sex once, it was sick.  EOS 4 0 14 Can a therapist help me with that?  EOS 4 0 15 Are you still there sir?  EOS 4 1 16 [Others] Sorry i was having wifi issues 
[reference_response]	sorry i was having wifi issues
[hypothesis_response]	i am not sure if she would be able to help, but you need to be honest with yourself and understand that you do have the right to be upset and hurt.

EOS 4 0 4 He dropped our relationship.  EOS 4 1 5 [Question] Can you block notifications for him?  EOS 4 1 6 [Information] How long ago did he stop it?

[contxt]	0 0 0 Hello  EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello. What seems to be the issue?  EOS 0 0 2 I don't have close friends because I don't trust people  EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said you generally don't trust family or people in general?  EOS 0 0 4 people in general, I do trust certain family members  EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just people who are close to you?  EOS 0 0 6 no, I have a hard time trusting people i don't know in order to make friends  EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I have had a hard time trusting strangers, but that is not a big problem.  EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I used to be the same way, but I learned about how to make and keep close friends.  EOS 0 0 9 i think it feels like a problem because I never let anyone too close in order to make friends and have an external support system  EOS 0 0 10 how did you do it  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I joined volunteer groups to help others. I made friends with like-minded people who volunteered to make a difference.  EOS 0 0 12 I actually think that is a great idea. I have never thought of doing that for that specific purpose.  EOS 0 1 13 [Information] Groups like Habitat for Humanity or UNICEF will help you to build long-lasting friendships.  EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It just takes finding the right volunteer groups and being willing to be pro-active.  EOS 0 0 15 I guess it makes a lot of sense. If you go to a party or a bar, you don't know what you will get, as it is a mixed bag of personalities. Whereas if you go to something like what you suggested then you already know that the people you meet have the same kind of heart.  EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can do it. I have faith that you can use volunteering as the right method.  EOS 0 0 17 Thank you for that suggestion, that is really helpful and something that I will take with me from now on.  EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Exactly, volunteering is a great option. And there are many organizations to join.  EOS 0 1 19 [Question] Did you need help with anything else?  EOS 0 0 20 I feel ok being alone mostly, but other times I would like to have people I could relate with and hang out with. Probably has a lot to do with ADHD and how I feel misunderstood or my anxiety gets the best of me in social situations  EOS 0 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I understand the ADHD. There are support groups that can help you make friends; especially with ADHD, etc.  EOS 0 0 22 do you know any specific groups?  EOS 0 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] Using tools to build houses helps to release endorphins, which can release anxiety.  EOS 0 0 24 is this something you have done?  EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] There is a group called, "Harry House" that provides support to those with ADHD and anxiety.  EOS 0 0 26 oh ok! I will certainly look that up, thank you for that information.  EOS 0 1 27 [Question] Surely. Is there anything else you need help with?  EOS 0 0 28 Does one have to travel far to participate in building houses?  EOS 0 1 29 [Providing Suggestions] No, Habitat fir Humanity has car pools.  EOS 0 0 30 do you know if it requires a person to be away from home a long time?  EOS 0 1 31 [Providing Suggestions] They are a good group to help you build meaningful relationships.

EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I'm sorry to hear that you have a sad situation happening with your dad.  EOS 4 0 5 I take all responsibilities - including financial  EOS 4 0 6 But i find him very dry with his emotions. Today,i fell unwell and i wanted to go take a covid test. but, he just brushed it off saying, its a mild flu.  EOS 4 0 7 He showed no emotions at all.  EOS 4 0 8 or concern  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like quite a challenge for you. You seem to care so much.  EOS 4 0 10 He simply told me, its a waste of money to go get checked  EOS 4 0 11 I know that old people sometimes act childish. But his dry behaviour makes me very sad.  EOS 4 0 12 sometimes this leads to a fight  EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] That must be hard to hear when you are trying so hard to do what's right.  EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I also am struggling to convince my father to stay away from crowds because of COVID.  EOS 4 0 15 Sometimes this behaviour of him leads to a fight. and i end up crying!

[contxt]	1 0 10 I can't seek help with a professional for my anger issues, because I have committed violent crimes to get even with my oppressors.  EOS 1 0 11 Are you going to help me?  EOS 1 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see I too have had my issues with other races. A few bad instances do not make represent a whole race though. There are also black males who have been robbed and jumped by white people that does not mean all white males are bad. It does seem that you have had alot of unfortunate events with black males. That still does not mean that all black people are bad and why should innocent people pay for things others have done. Do you have to walk home from work or can you drive. Also have you reported any of these events to the police.  EOS 1 0 13 I walk home because my job is only a mile away. I live in a predominantly black area. The police have taken reports, but candidly admitted to me that nothing would happen as far as arrests because of the current "woke" climate.  EOS 1 1 14 [Others] I understand have you ever thought about if that black man that raped your wife was just getting even with the white race because his wife or maybe even him was raped repeatedly by white supremists  EOS 1 0 15 It upsets me, the way I feel. I do have 2 or 3 black neighbors who are decent people, but thats it. I am the only White person on my street. I am constantly taunted by the blacks in my area.  EOS 1 0 16 No black woman has been raped by a white man in recent history, even DOJ crime statistics back me up on this one. When is the last time anyone remembers a pack of white men raping a black lady?  EOS 1 0 17 I just want to not be scared around here anymore. I am sick of being victimized. They are pushing me over the edge.  EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] My suggestion would be to get out of the area if is just triggering your anger. Are you able to move to another area?  EOS 1 0 19 I can move, but it would be very costly. And I don't want to move now because it is winter and it is cold and we have over a foot of snow on the ground.  EOS 1 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] I would suggest for your mental health when the weather is better to move and until then I would avoid areas that can potentially be dangerous and also don't walk home after dark. Also you need to keep seeking council for you anger and racial feelings. I would suggest when you feel very angry to take a deep breath think will your actions help or hurt the situation. To help with racial issues I would like you to sit and talk to black victims who have been victimized by white people in violent crimes.  EOS 1 0 21 I appreciate this advice. It does seem good. I just want everything to get better.  EOS 1 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If you follow my advice I think you will see a great improvement. Your willingness to seek advice and ability to identify that you have a problem is a big first step all you got to do now is put the solutions into practice.  EOS 1 0 23 Do you think that maybe I should go to church or something to help?  EOS 1 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] Church is always a great idea. I think church would be very helpful. Maybe someday you should even consider going to a predominantly black church. 
[reference_response]	church is always a great idea. i think church would be very helpful. maybe someday you should even consider going to a predominantly black church.
[hypothesis_response]	yes, i think that is a great idea. it might help you to think about what you are doing to make yourself feel better. that way you can make more sense of your own problems and hopefully you will be able to help people who are in the same situation.

[contxt]	4 0 1 I'm sad today Rob.  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I'm sorry to hear that, when did you start feeling this way?  EOS 4 0 3 Probably about 3 months ago.  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Did something happen to trigger this for you? Or did it just kind of start without an explanation?  EOS 4 0 5 My kids started online learning in their respective rooms during the day. One day they both came running to me after about 3 days of school asking me for various things that kids do. They were only coming to me and my husband sort of participated in the beginning but now he is falling back the last few months and it has taken a toll on our relationship.  EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Correct me if I'm wron g, your children are now online learning, and you are feeling defeated because your husband is pulling away and not providing you the support you need?  EOS 4 0 7 Thi s very correct!  EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would be very hard, especially with the way the world is right now. I want you to know your feelings are valid, and I'm sure you are trying your best.  EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried talking to your husband about your feelings, and how it is affecting your day today life?  EOS 4 0 10 I am but our relationship is in jeopardy and we are arguing more than ever.  EOS 4 0 11 Yes, but he seemingly will not compromise.  EOS 4 0 12 He tried to suggest a half and half deal or this time im here for them and this time he is. He is not holding up to his promises.  EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] That makes it hard when you have already tried to take the steps to help you improve the situation. If I may offer a suggestion, perhaps you should approach him, and advise him you are not interested in arguing since that won't improve the situation, but be up-front and honest about how this is making you feel, and how his lack of support will ultimately harm the whole family. And also maybe ask him if there is anything going on with him to find out why his support to you, and the children has changed.

EOS 1 1 4 [Question] Can I ask what has happened?  EOS 1 0 5 My sibling broke the tv and blamed it on me and my parents believed them  EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. That must be a hard situation, to not have your folks believe you.  EOS 1 0 7 It is very frustrating  EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Have you spoken with your sibling about why they lied?  EOS 1 0 9 No, we just got into a yelling fight about it and are both in our rooms now  EOS 1 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure it's frustrating when you know you're correct and no one believes you.  EOS 1 0 11 Yes it is  EOS 1 0 12 I'd rather just run away from everything  EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] It's not cool that you're sibling lied, but it may be a good time to breathe a second. Running away never solved anything  EOS 1 0 14 It is late at night  EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] So probably it's quiet. this is a good time to take a breath and , literally try and sleep on it.  EOS 1 1 16 [Question] What do you want to see happen?  EOS 1 0 17 that is probably a good idea. I want my sibling to be punished not me and for parents to believe me  EOS 1 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] OK, I understand.  EOS 1 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] So, then, it's how to figure out how to make that happen.  EOS 1 0 20 well my parents dont believe me so not much i can do  EOS 1 1 21 [Question] May I ask why they believe your sibling? Is your sibling a different age?  EOS 1 0 22 they are younger and the favorite  EOS 1 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand.  EOS 1 0 24 I just need to wait until I'm 18 so I can move far away  EOS 1 1 25 [Question] So, it sounds like you already have a plan to turn things around. How far away from 18 are you, if I can ask?  EOS 1 0 26 1 year  EOS 1 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] OK, good for you. It may not seem like it, but you can do anything for a year.  EOS 1 0 28 True.  EOS 1 0 29 I can't wait  EOS 1 1 30 [Question] So, the question is....how do you deal in the short term?

It seems like things are getting worse. My anxiety is high.  EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe God put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings  EOS 3 0 9 I doubt it will get better, but thanks for the positive vibes.  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Have you ever try to talk to your love one at home? Or maybe take time to communicate more with your friends?

EOS 4 1 5 [Information] I would be willing to do that  EOS 4 0 6 I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We dated for two years. Just feeling blue.  EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Break ups are the worst and feeling blue is totally understandable.  EOS 4 0 8 I just need to do things to keep my mind off of it I guess.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Reflection is important but healing and moving on which will take a little time is also important :-).  EOS 4 0 10 You are so right. Any ideas on what I should do?  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes distraction is really good like taking up a new interest or reading a good book something like that. Any friends you can hang out with?  EOS 4 0 12 I love reading. I might do just that. I have friends but with this pandemic it is hard to get together with them.  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes this pandemic has really been hard on social interaction and a good book you can be great distraction.  EOS 4 0 14 I will do that. I might try some yoga.

EOS 6 0 11 No, I was relatively new after leaving the military and was looking for a job so no leave days available  EOS 6 0 12 I really liked the employees and everyone was kind though. It's just the risk of exposure that made me stressed  EOS 6 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I understand, I can tell through typing with you that this has made you very anxious.  EOS 6 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Did you get any contact information from the employees you worked with while you were there? Often it helps to keep in touch with previous co-workers, especially during a time like this.  EOS 6 0 15 Yes, I do have the numbers of a few of them. I talked to them a little during the day but I mainly kept to myself as I planned my next few steps  EOS 6 0 16 I was just ashamed for having left after they have been so helpful  EOS 6 0 17 I pride myself in being loyal and supportive but it was just too much risk to myself and family  EOS 6 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that completely, but I know you can make it through this!

[contxt]	4 1 1 [Question] Good morning. What type of decision is troubling you?  EOS 4 0 2 A few weeks ago, my lover and I decided to stop our affair. It is the right choice for him because he feels he should work on his marriage. I admire that, yet It is very lonely for me right now  EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand the feeling lonely would make you feel your decision was wrong but from an outsiders view, it was not a healthy relationship if he was already committed to someone.  EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You deserve something better. Someone dedicated to you.  EOS 4 0 5 It was a fantastic experience. we were together for 3 years. I am not mad at him, he's a good guy. He was separated when we met. But as all life, it's complicated  EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I have been in your shoes before. I learned a lot and found out more about myself in the growing experience after the relationship ended. I'm sure there was some positives even with you at the end of the relationship now.  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Each person is put in our life for a reason or season. This may just be the stepping stone to finding your soul mate. The perfect relationship won't feel so tricky in the long run and will make you feel on top of the world!  EOS 4 0 8 Yes, I had my eyes wide open during the process and he and I were very open with our communication. I can see lots of blessings but I am just so sad. Each day is a challenge to focus  EOS 4 0 9 I can't imagine a relationship right now  EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Sounds like you really but your heart in to this and I'm sure it hurts. No need to rush relationship. Falling back in love with yourself is the key first. Finding your inner happiness will make the next relationship that much better and stronger!  EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] Treat yourself to a few solo dates to find joy in the day to day life you are now building without him.  EOS 4 0 12 I have heard the idea of dating ones self  EOS 4 0 13 I haven't been out to eat for over a year due to the pandemic situation  EOS 4 1 14 [Others] It can be fun! No decisons on who wants to go where. It is all about you enjoying the moment and your own company!  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] No need to go out if you feel uncomfortable. Find a movie you have been wanting to watch and order some take out! Or do some online shopping while enjoying your favorite dessert or adult beverage!  EOS 4 0 16 During this time with the affair, I had the strength to leave a narcissistic spouse that abused me emotionally. I am proud of myself for that.  EOS 4 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] That is a lot to handle! I am proud of you for that as well! No one ever deserves to be abused. Some solo time to rebuild your independance may do you wonders and give you back your strength and self confidence! Seems like the past year has been emotionally draining.  EOS 4 0 18 It has been. You are right about me focusing on solo time.  EOS 4 1 19 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I think you know yourself better than anyone else and are about to leap in to a new chapter of your life. You received lessons from both the past relationships and can take that forward knowing what you wish for and deserve.

EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I agree it's bad! Where I live in the US our numbers are going back up and the kids are being home schooled again. I just keep thinking this is temporary!  EOS 4 0 6 Yes I suppose it does help to think it possible not for the long term but my friends seem to be dealing with it better than I am and I'm not quite sure why it's put me in such a sad emotional state. I should just get on with it but have very low motivation  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning.

[contxt]	2 0 13 I like to read  EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That can be handy!  EOS 2 0 15 I like to walk on the beach  EOS 2 1 16 [Question] Is that something you can do with regularity? Getting out and walking?  EOS 2 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I know that I've had good luck battling my depression by just finding ways to not be at home. Hiking, going for walks, going for drives...  EOS 2 0 18 Yes I live on the beach but its so cold right now I cant even do that. I feal so isolated  EOS 2 0 19 Im going to do that tomorrow  EOS 2 1 20 [Others] Good! It's hard to start, but it's a good way to start. How far do you plan on going?  EOS 2 0 21 Im going to bundle up and go to the beach. Probably walk down to the pier 1 mile  EOS 2 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] That will be good. Make sure you can take some time and really appreciate not being in the house.  EOS 2 1 23 [Question] Is there any music or podcats you can listen to while out?

Practicing mindfulness can really help, and help put things in perspective. Often times we build things up to be even worse than they already are. Being able to be grateful for what's around can help, without diminishing the issues that you are facing.  EOS 2 0 27 Thats good advice, thanks I think you helped me  EOS 2 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] Remembering that it's okay to be sad and depressed, as much as it sucks, can be helpful in reframing.

EOS 2 1 33 [Question] Do you have any pets?  EOS 2 0 34 I have a Russian Blue cat ssmart very smart cat  EOS 2 1 35 [Others] Smart cats are the best. They know when you need cuddles, which it sounds like you do! Also means you aren't alone. ;) Cat needs ya! As much as they don't want to admit it.  EOS 2 0 36 He's my buddy for sure. Makes me happy to think of him  EOS 2 1 37 [Providing Suggestions] If you are healthy/feel comfortable with going out, you could consider volunteering at an animal shelter. You'd get to interact with some folks, some animals, and add something to the resume. I don't know if you are likely to get hours back at work or what you do, but that could be fun!  EOS 2 0 38 Thats a good idea I'll look into it. Well we better wrap this hit up?  EOS 2 1 39 [Others] I believe it needs to be a minimum of 20 minutes and we are at 17 right now.

[contxt]	4 0 1 I have been in a relationship for just over two years. At the start it was fun and we got along great. I think we have little in common these days and I don't feel the same way I used to. I don;t want to hurt her feelings but I'm thinking about ending the relationship.  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Have you been feeling this way for a while or is it a surprise change?  EOS 4 0 3 I have felt like this for a while now but I'm thinking about if more nowadays. It doesn't feel right and I don't know who to handle it.  EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have felt for a while that things aren't right in your relationship and you don't know how to end the relationship without hurting your girlfriend's feelings?  EOS 4 0 5 That's correct yes. I worry that she will be very upset and the thought of her in distress does concern me. It might be easier to stay together but I don't think that's the right thing to do.  EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can tell that you are a nice person that cares for your girlfriend and you want the best for her. I think you want to be honest with her which is a good sign of maturity and integrity.  EOS 4 0 7 Thanks for that. I do care for her which is why I don't want to upset her.  EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Unfortunately this may be upsetting in the short term. I had a friend who had a similar issue. He wanted to end things with his girlfriend and they ended up having an honest conversation, which was upsetting at the time but they are still friends to this day and parted on good terms.

EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i'm so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave?  EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on.  EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad  EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more . I feel that everyone must know that I've been dumped and be laughing at me.  EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time  EOS 1 0 10 I did not really have any choice though .

I'm sorry to hear that. Would you be willing to talk about it with me? Sometimes talking with someone is the help that we need.  EOS 4 0 4 Due to this pandemic, I fear for the safety of my job. It's cause me anxiety and stress.  EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can sense how stressed you are about the safety of your job. This pandemic has caused so much stress and very much anxiety on everyone, so just know you are not alone. I'm not sure on the work you do, but you putting your health at risk everyday to make a living for you and your family makes you an amazing person. Just try and remember that your health is very much more important then your job and just make sure you are trying everything possible to keep yourself safe out there.  EOS 4 0 6 Thanks for the positive vibes, but I doubt things will get better.  EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Of course! I also am afraid that this pandemic is going to get worse before it gets any better and that is just my opinion. I am scared for everyone out here anymore and its not just people getting sick and ill, but people like you who could be in jeopardy of loosing their job or their source of income. That's is something that would be on anyones mind, more yours then mine due to you actually working in the public.  EOS 4 0 8 There is a lock down in my area, I fear it will only get worse.  EOS 4 1 9 [Information] We thankfully have not got on lockdown just yet, but I know it will be happening soon. We live in a very small town and it has got bad here that either we know someone who has it, or someone in the family has it.

I am seeing a therapist, but due to the pandemic we are not meeting in person to do EDMR for my PTSD  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Hello, I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds like an awful lot to go through in a few years time, which now can feel like the time passes so quickly.  EOS 4 0 3 I have a traumatic brain injury that creates a lot of overstimulation in my life. I used to be social and now I can't be in a social setting for too long without feeling exhausted  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Have you tried to talk to your therapist through video chat or is that something they offer?  EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I talk to my therapist every other week  EOS 4 1 6 [Others] That's great that they can offer that, I know it's very difficult to get regular care at the moment with the pandemic.  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Do you have any family or friends close by or something that you can talk to if you feel like you need some extra support?  EOS 4 0 8 I do not have supportive or understanding friends and family  EOS 4 0 9 I have lost a lot of them in the last few years or have created boundaries because when I got into my first car accident, legit someone said "are you not better yet?" and another said "can't you just walk it off?"

EOS 4 0 11 Even though neither were my fault, people were not understanding or asked how scary those situations for me were  EOS 4 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that, people are very quick to judge so it's very unfortunate that you were treated that way.

[contxt]	2 0 1 Hello.  EOS 2 1 2 [Others] Hey :)  EOS 2 0 3 I just found out that I will be losing my job. I have no clue what to do.  EOS 2 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I was in a similar situation a short while back I can understand if you feel anxious and stressed.  EOS 2 1 5 [Question] Was it due to the pandemic?  EOS 2 0 6 Yes it is. We haven't gotten the funding form the government and we are a small business. I am not sure how to tell my wife.  EOS 2 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So if I understand the anxiety of you losing your job is increased because you also have to give your wife the news?  EOS 2 0 8 Yes and I also have to find some place else to work at.  EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] If where you live has some form of unemployment insurance it may be a good time to apply for it if your comfortable with that since you are aware your job is coming to an end  EOS 2 0 10 Not a bad idea. I will look into that for sure. I am not sure how long it will take to get it. I'm not to bad off because I do have savings but I am just worried that I will not be able to find any work around where I live and I don't want to move.  EOS 2 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It's completly understandable that telling your wife is additionally difficult since it's life effecting news and you are probably worried about the effect the news will have on your wife  EOS 2 0 12 Yes for sure. She has her job so it just would feel weird for me to be at home while she works.  EOS 2 1 13 [Self-disclosure] In my case I am still currently in school and lack credentials but I've managed to find some online work that is getting me by  EOS 2 0 14 I never have thought about online work. That might be a good idea.  EOS 2 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] You may want to budget relevant areas of yur spending ahead of time so your savings will go longer but Isuggest not to the point that it effects your mental well being  EOS 2 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Also if your on good terms maybe get references  EOS 2 0 17 That is a great idea. I am sure I can get references. My boss loves me. He said he is looking to help me any way he can.  EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I don't drive so my options were limited to avoid riding the bus I do recommend getting out of you living space other ways if you work online but its all right  EOS 2 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think with that kind of connection with your boss especially with your job loss being circumstantial you should have a really good starting point 
[reference_response]	i think with that kind of connection with your boss especially with your job loss being circumstantial you should have a really good starting point
[hypothesis_response]	i know it can be hard at times. but i think that you will get through it and will be able continue to keep your job even if your boss doesn't like it.

[contxt]	4 0 1 Hi, I'm just wanting to talk about my sadness that happens every now and then. Sometimes at night, (and only at night) I get in these super depressive moods and have almost mental breakdowns about everything in my life. But it doesn't happen all the time... only sometime and I don't know why  EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a really difficult situation to be in, I'm sorry to hear you're going through that.  EOS 4 0 3 Yeah it is, and I'm not sure why it happens  EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Especially when the sun starts going down sooner, it can seem like we have less time, and as if things are closing in upon us.  EOS 4 0 5 Yeah exactly. Where I live, we just had daylight savings so it gets dark around 5:30 PM and it feels like my days are just wasted  EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] There are a few strategies you could use to combat that. Personally, I try to soak in as much sunlight as possible before it goes down. Sometimes that will mean moving your work space, maybe getting up earlier to have a cup of coffee in the sunrise, maybe it's scheduling breaks into your day where you specifically get some vitamin D.  EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] As far as the intrusive and repetitive nature of the thoughts, have you ever consulted with a therapist or other mental health professional? Obsessive thoughts are sometimes a sign of anxiety.  EOS 4 0 8 Yeah that is good advice. I definitely need to work on getting myself up earlier in the mornings, I've just come so accustomed to my current sleep schedule.  EOS 4 0 9 And in all honesty, I haven't tried a therapist yet... I'm scared it will be hard to open up to a stranger  EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's an understandable fear. 
[reference_response]	that's an understandable fear.
[hypothesis_response]	i would suggest seeing a professional for help with that, or maybe even if you are feeling lonely or anxious, just talk to someone you feel comfortable talking to about it.
[comet query]	And in all honesty, I haven't tried a therapist yet... I'm scared it will be hard to open up to a stranger

I feel like a part of me died that day, the part that thought I could protect her no matter what. I would say that I'm also feeling ashamed because it was out of my control.  EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are dealing with a lot...it is normal to feel anxious about it  EOS 3 0 11 Is that how you would feel?  EOS 3 1 12 [Others] and it's hard not to blame ourselves, but please remember this was outside your control  EOS 3 0 13 thank you for saying that.

EOS 2 1 4 [Question] I completely understand and had similar experiences. What were some ways you tried to interact with people last shut down?  EOS 2 0 5 I use facebook quite a lot and it helps but it cannot compensate for face to face contact. I really need to be able to see people.  EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Digital contact does have its limitations. Could you meet with people outside at a distance?

EOS 0 0 5 i feel like my life is an unscheduled mess. nothing ever happens when its supposed to  EOS 0 0 6 i plan things and it always falls through and doesnt happen  EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like the chaos and disorganization is really bother you. Is that right?  EOS 0 0 8 yes  EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I can certainly understand. When my children were young and I worked full-time outside of the home, I found it very difficult to keep things in my life organized.  EOS 0 0 10 my partners schedule changes about 3 times a day. so i never know if what i had planned will happen or not. usually not.

EOS 0 0 3 I keep failing online classes even when I seem to have them under control. I think it might have something to do with me playing too much videogames.  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you are playing video games as a distraction from how bad the world is at the moment?  EOS 0 0 5 No, I don't think that's it. I have been playing games since I was 6.  EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Ah, so it's a long term hobby? I do love gaming myself I have to admit.  EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] Could you perhaps set yourself some strict boundaries, like you can only do a certain number of hours of gaming a day?  EOS 0 0 8 I tried, but my online rank not being where I want it gives me anxiety  EOS 0 0 9 and I keep coming back  EOS 0 0 10 Just one more match, just one more, I keep telling me  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] It sounds like you might have a genuine addiction to gaming. Do you think you might benefit from some counselling? There are organisations that can help.  EOS 0 0 12 Do you really think it's that severe?  EOS 0 1 13 [Others] Well, if it is affecting your grades and the rest of your real life then it might be. And it's best to catch these things before they get worse.

[contxt]	3 0 1 I'm a little bummed because my friend is not only a junkie but he got arrested last week.  EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch! Your friend got arrested for drugs last week?  EOS 3 0 3 He got arrested for stealing to fund his addiction.  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I had a neighbor who was doing meth, and he got arrested, and that actually saved his life. He had to get sober and look at what he was doing.  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] There is a hard line between helping a friend who is addicted and actually enabling them. Have you ever heard of this?  EOS 3 0 6 Sadly my friend has been arrested a few times, spent time in prison, and is fully locked in his lifestyle. He's such a great person, very funny, nice, but he is lost  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It can be very hard to watch a loved one destroy their lives. Has anyone every discussed an intervention?  EOS 3 0 8 He has alienated all of his friends, including me. I was the last one holding on  EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] My husband and I actually have worked with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. We are retired now, but still volunteer. Sometimes we have to let go of our loved ones - they have to hit rock bottom. Very hard to do, but unless they see their behavior as destructive, they don't want to change.  EOS 3 0 10 I agree, I'm afraid that's what I have to do. Another one of our mutual friends passed away recently to an overdose. I don't want to lose another friend.  EOS 3 1 11 [Others] Have you seen the serenity prayer? Knowing what to do, what not to do and accepting life really is a great thing to ask God for. We can't change others. Yet you have to find a way to have peace.  EOS 3 0 12 Yes. I know I have to let go. I've punished myself trying to stay in his life.  EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] It's very hard to lose friends to addictions. It's epidemic in our society now. However, you can pray for them and look for ways to keep your life on track so you don't get lost focusing on them and not where you want to go.  EOS 3 0 14 all drugs are bad, but meth is a truly evil drug.  EOS 3 0 15 It's just rotting his soul and body. He believes he can't stop and you're right, letting go and just sending prayers is all i can really do now  EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] very evil, I agree, I like to write out a list of things I can do to distract myself from overly being concerned, if that makes sense. Like I take time to think about them and pray for them, then I have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where I want to go and how to get there. Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol  EOS 3 1 17 [Self-disclosure] My husband just got me a daytimer, and I write my goals in that for the new year, and I try to check it every day and try to focus on moving forward, because life has a way of throwing us curveballs like this, and we can't get stuck in them.

EOS 4 0 4 Just kind of "blah."  EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that feeling. Have you lost interest in things that you normally would enjoy?  EOS 4 0 6 I don't know that I have exactly lost interest. I still do them, but somehow it feels like I'm just going through the motions.  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can relate to that. Have you thought about trying something new, or taking up a new hobby? That has helped me before  EOS 4 0 8 Not really. I guess that I'm just kind of stuck in a rut.  EOS 4 1 9 [Question] Would you be willing to try a new hobby to make each day less monotonous?  EOS 4 0 10 Yes, I would be, but I'm not sure that it actually needs to be a new hobby. I just need to have some sort of project that I'm working on.  EOS 4 1 11 [Others] Maybe a new home improvement project?  EOS 4 0 12 No! I've got a jigsaw puzzle that I could start, and I also have a list of "21 books that you've been meaning to read."  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those both sound like great ideas! I think starting one, or both, would really make you feel a lot better.  EOS 4 0 14 If I start working through the 21 books, that should keep me going for quite a while (even if I'm not interested in all of them)!  EOS 4 1 15 [Others] I believe it will also help give you a sense of accomplishment. I know that it would me  EOS 4 0 16 I agree.  EOS 4 1 17 [Others] Perfect! It sounds like you may have found a solution to help you get out of this rut and "blah" feeling  EOS 4 0 18 Thanks for chatting.  EOS 4 1 19 [Others] I hope that you start feeling better.

EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Losing a job is always anxious.  EOS 0 0 4 I hope I don't.  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Why do you think you will lose your job?  EOS 0 0 6 I am on short term disability and I am not ready to go back to work yet but I do not have any job protection.  EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh so your job is not protected and your short term disability will end soon? Is that correct?  EOS 0 0 8 It's not ending yet, but no my job is not protected. I live in the United States, but I have not been at my job long enough to earn protection for medical leave.  EOS 0 0 9 you have to have been here for a year, and I started November 2020  EOS 0 0 10 I'm afraid that I will lose my job since I'm still on disability for the foreseeable future.  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I see. Have you spoken to HR?  EOS 0 0 12 I have, but they are telling me that it is up to my department manager who isn't actually getting back to me about it yet.  EOS 0 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your department manager is not answering you?  EOS 0 0 14 No, I have sent them a few emails about it. It makes me nervous. I do not have a phone number to call and my psychiatrist really does not think I am ready to go back to the stress of my job.  EOS 0 0 15 I wish I could just call him, but I do not have a phone number for him. Just his email.  EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried mentioning that to HR?  EOS 0 0 17 HR is the one who gave me his email.  EOS 0 0 18 I don't think he has a direct work line, and they're not allowed to give out personal information.  EOS 0 1 19 [Information] Yes that is how most employments work about providing personal information.  EOS 0 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] That in itself causes anxiety to most since other forms of communication is not possible especially if they are not responding to ciritcal matters.  EOS 0 0 21 Yes! 100%. Every time my phone rings I get nervous that I'm being fired and I'm worried I made a mistake going out on disability. I needed to though, but I'm nervous.

EOS 1 0 3 I recently discovered some discrepancies in my paycheck. I am not sure what to do to correct the situation. I am just so upset right now.  EOS 1 1 4 [Information] I can definitely understand why this could make someone upset. What are you considering doing about the situation?  EOS 1 0 5 I'm not sure. I thought about quitting but I have been working there for over 7 years. I haven't even told my boss yet.  EOS 1 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] That sounds really tough. Sometimes people who are in your situation find it comforting to talk to someone they are close with . What do you think about this?  EOS 1 0 7 I think that could be helpful. I might call my sister and ask her advice. It is probably not a good idea to quit my job.  EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like your sister might be able to help you figure out this situation. It can always be helpful to make a list of pros and cons about the situation. You originally said you were angry because of a discrepancy with your paycheck, but on the other hand it sounds like you are considering quitting your job altogether. What are your thoughts about this?  EOS 1 0 9 Wow that is a great idea. A list of pros and cons might help me decide if I should stay there. I think I will make one today. I also need to tell my boss. Maybe it was just a clerical error. I hope I'm not reading too much into it.  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It always seems easy to read to much into things. Another suggestion is to think about how the clerical error happened. Was it because of your boss? Or perhaps just an accident?  EOS 1 0 11 That is what I am unsure about. I think I have to tell my boss so they can look into this issue. I hope my sister is able to give me some good advice about what to say!

EOS 4 0 6 i dont know how i can get over ,its heart breaking since i heard about the sad news of his demise  EOS 4 0 7 have been taking Alcohol since to wipe away the emotion but its seems its getting more complicated  EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I can tell you are very sad about this situation and understandably so. It seems as if alcohol is your coping mechanism right now correct? Do you have close friends to share your emotions with?  EOS 4 0 9 yes , i normally take Alcohol any time am going through any sad moment , i dont have friends near by , am the nly one at home  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I see. I also am the only one in my home and frequently have no one to turn to during hard times. Have you thought about a local grief counselor?  EOS 4 0 11 yes , i am actually thinking about that when mymind is at ease  EOS 4 0 12 actually i dont like disclosing my affairs or what am passing through with strangers  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have taken this step and most counselors can do virtual meetings if you would like to keep yourself anonymous. I know it would be really hard for but I have total confidence in you!  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried any other ways besides alcohol?  EOS 4 0 15 owk, thanks  EOS 4 0 16 not really , i havent take anything except alcohol  EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] Journaling your feelings has also been an effective way to get the emotions out! You seem like you have a lot to share so it might be a good option for you! 
[reference_response]	journaling your feelings has also been an effective way to get the emotions out! you seem like you have a lot to share so it might be a good option for you!

[contxt]	1 0 1 Hi there!  EOS 1 1 2 [Question] Are you doing ok with the Virus  EOS 1 0 3 Doing ok I think. But I think the stress is getting to me. How about you?  EOS 1 1 4 [Question] What would like chatting about  EOS 1 0 5 Any suggestions on how to deal with a boss who you don't feel appreciates you?  EOS 1 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So u have a boss that you feel is against you  EOS 1 1 7 [Question] Does your work involve meeting him or her daily  EOS 1 0 8 In a way yes. I've worked for this person for several years. Felt I've done a really good job. Gone above and beyond but my evaluations always come back as just meets expectations. Nothing more. Just fond out he's hiring someone new to train to take over his job when he retires.  EOS 1 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You must have your sites set on the position as well. That can be frustrating  EOS 1 1 10 [Question] Can I ask how many others work with you  EOS 1 0 11 It would have been nice to have been considered. At least been in the conversation. There are 3 others on our team.  EOS 1 0 12 The other 2 are part timers  EOS 1 1 13 [Others] might I ask the gender of your boss  EOS 1 0 14 male  EOS 1 1 15 [Others] same as u right  EOS 1 0 16 no, I'm female.  EOS 1 1 17 [Question] Are there any other females working with you  EOS 1 0 18 currently, no. the new person he's looking to hire to take over eventually is female.  EOS 1 1 19 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I assume you are full time  EOS 1 0 20 Yes, I'm full time.  EOS 1 1 21 [Others] So you seem qualified for the position, have you been able to ask why he overlooked you  EOS 1 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being overlooked because of personal reasons should not be a reason to offer the position to an outsider  EOS 1 0 23 Haven't had the chance to bring it up. The boss tends to have a temper and doesn't like questions to his decisions. Trying to figure out a way to bring it up without making the work situation more difficult.  EOS 1 1 24 [Self-disclosure] It would affect me as well if I was overlooked and the position was offered to an outsider  EOS 1 1 25 [Question] Is he mean towards others or just you  EOS 1 0 26 Glad to hear I'm not just being petty about it. It's his general nature. His approach is more like a bull in a china shop. His way or no way.  EOS 1 1 27 [Question] Are his tempers basically towards you because you are full time 
[reference_response]	are his tempers basically towards you because you are full time
[hypothesis_response]	sounds like he is in a position of power.

[contxt]	4 0 1 Hi, I;m not too good. Just trying to get over a really bad breakup, still haven't wrapped my head around it to be honest  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am so sorry to hear that you want to tell me what happened?  EOS 4 0 3 Yeah, apparently the covid situation was getting to him and after he lost his job, he decided he wanted to find himself and try the single life after ten years together  EOS 4 1 4 [Question] oh no that is terrible, are you able to support yourself financially without him?  EOS 4 0 5 Yeah, thankfully, I was basically supporting us both. It was just the shock of it all. I came home from work and he was packing his things, no discussion, nothing just it's over and I've literally been crying all day. I don;t even think I miss him, I'm just mad about how he went about it  EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is cruel, I am sure you are in shock, to leave without an explanation, or a real one is terrible. So you have no contact withim what so ever?  EOS 4 0 7 No contact, I sort of lost my temper when he tried to talk things over because I think he was going to use this as a threat but I was so disgusted after being tired from work that I just threw my phone and now my way of contacting him is gone  EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Maybe that is not all bad, gives him time to think and you too. And if he regrets what he did he will return. But then you would have to make a decission, if you would want him back.  EOS 4 0 9 I sort of don't think I want him back. Not when he thinks our relationship is some sort of pawn for him to hold over my head. It sucks because my parents didn't even like him, I stuck my neck out for him and now this happens  EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Well I am sure it sucks and feels a bit lonely. But if you dont want him back have a glass of wine and celebrate the you, you deserve the best and nothing less.  EOS 4 0 11 I think I'm more scared of being alone because we were together for so long, you know? Like I haven't ever lived on my own. It sounds dumb but I think I'm going to miss the company more than my relationship  EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I believe it is hard to home is all of a sudden much more quiet, maybe invite a friend over? I am sorry you are going through this.  EOS 4 0 13 Or I could get a cat, to be honest being a cat lady might be less stressful  EOS 4 0 14 A cat would definitely be cheaper  EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] They are fun to have LOL, now that is the spirit go to the shelter and safe one of those poor souls. And you can pet it and it is happy to see you any time,

[contxt]	4 0 1 I am okay, thanks.  EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you’d like to talk about?  EOS 4 0 3 Yes, lately my friends have been going through divorces and many have moved away.  EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow, you’ve lost friends. I know how that feels.  EOS 4 1 5 [Question] So you’re missing them?  EOS 4 0 6 Yes, it's very sad and a difficult situation because my husband is friends with some of the husbands and I am friends with the wives.  EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I honestly believe we all go through that.  EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it’s especially difficult with divorce.  EOS 4 0 9 Maybe. I never thought I would to this extent. The pandemic created so much stress for people.  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Friends are so important to me also.  EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Do you thing the covid crisis has caused more divorces?  EOS 4 0 12 Right. It's tragic to see so many going through divorces and separations at the same time.  EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It’s certainly more difficult to make new friends now.  EOS 4 0 14 Yes, I have 4 sets of friends divorcing and they all separated after March 2020.  EOS 4 0 15 It is. Nothing is open anymore and so many people are guarded.  EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow, that’s difficult.  EOS 4 1 17 [Question] You’re married?  EOS 4 0 18 It is. And 3 of my friends are moving home to be with family who all live out of state and far away.  EOS 4 0 19 I am married. My husband and I are fine.  EOS 4 0 20 We've actually grown closer despite all of this.  EOS 4 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I sure miss my friends.  EOS 4 0 22 Yes, me too.  EOS 4 1 23 [Self-disclosure] That’s wonderful, I am closer to my spouse now also.

I'm a little fearful and sad today because I found out my mother hurt her knee and won't be able to work for a while.  EOS 2 1 3 [Question] Sorry to hear that. is it possible her job can give her light duties for a while  EOS 2 0 4 Unfortunately she is a nurse and needs to be able to work with patients. I don't think there are any light duty options.  EOS 2 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand your concern for your mom, you sound like a caring child..  EOS 2 0 6 Thank you, I think I am. I am always worrying about my mother, so this is nothing new. Although, financially this will be more stressful.  EOS 2 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] If I am understanding you correctly, you feel your mom may not be able to sustain herself during her time of recovery, is that correct?

[contxt]	3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered getting into any hobbies to take your mind off of what's going on?  EOS 3 0 23 No no... my profile picture. Yours shows up as a squirrel. lol  EOS 3 0 24 I usually hike a lot, but my hiking groups aren't going out right now.  EOS 3 1 25 [Others] Oh! I'm so sorry! Haha!  EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered things like journaling, reading, or arts and crafts?  EOS 3 0 27 Maybe I should get a pet squirrel?  EOS 3 0 28 Yes, I actually read and write quite a bit. Especially for work. That's not overly therapeutic, but it helps nonetheless.  EOS 3 1 29 [Others] That may not be a bad idea! If you really like them and are able to properly care for it, animals can be very therapeutic!  EOS 3 0 30 I have one dog who isn't much bigger than a squirrel. She has been an invaluable companion.  EOS 3 1 31 [Information] Writing and reading have been proven to be extremely therapeutic. I used to write down my feelings on a piece of paper and then destroy it (throw it away) once I was done. There's something about it that really seems to help.  EOS 3 1 32 [Others] Aww! That sounds like an adorable dog! What breed of dog is she? I have two cats myself. They make me feel better on a daily basis!  EOS 3 0 33 I've tried to keep a journal but I never stick to it. I find that writing letters to friends serves me the same purpose, and it helps me to stay connected, too. Plus, people love getting real, hand-written mail.  EOS 3 0 34 She is a miniature dachshund. Today she went to the bank with me, and all of the tellers came to the window to look into the car at her. lol I like cats too. Animals are so healing.  EOS 3 1 35 [Others] That sounds like a great idea! I love the fact that it helps you to stay connected, especially considering (as you already mentioned) that it's difficult to connect right now since we're dealing with COVID-19.  EOS 3 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I love that you're telling me about your dog and how all of the people at the bank wanted to see her! I bet that made you feel much better.  EOS 3 0 37 Yeah, and you're right. There's something therapeutic and cathartic about hand writing that typing does not replicate.  EOS 3 0 38 Yes, it made me happy to see them fawning over her. And it made her happy because they gave her treats.  EOS 3 0 39 Dealing with issues during Covid is so rough.  EOS 3 1 40 [Self-disclosure] I couldn't agree more. Dealing with COVID on top of everything else has been extremely difficult for me. Honestly, I think it is part of what caused a lot of the issues that I'm currently dealing with.  EOS 3 0 41 I hope you're handling them okay. I'm generally well except for the whole breakup business. Still, I know I'm better off. It just sucks sometimes.  EOS 3 1 42 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It makes me happy to hear that you know that you're better off. I know it's sad, but accepting that a relationship wasn't meant to be is, in my opinion, the first step to truly getting over someone. A year is a long time to spend with one person.  EOS 3 0 43 I wish it was easier and okay to travel right now. A trip or a road trip would do me wonders.  EOS 3 0 44 So is five years! I hope everything works out for the best for you, too.  EOS 3 1 45 [Others] I completely agree! Where would you go if you were able to right now?  EOS 3 0 46 If there was no virus... maybe Scotland or Las Vegas to see some shows. Or up into Canada. (I'm in Pennsylvania.)  EOS 3 1 47 [Self-disclosure] Thank you so much! We broke up several months ago and I'm already feeling and doing so much better. I am also much better off without that person in my life. I've gained weight back that I couldn't really afford to lose to begin with, I've been more motivated, etc. It really was for the best even though the breakup itself was really difficult.  EOS 3 1 48 [Others] I live in Pennsylvania as well! It's such a small world!  EOS 3 0 49 My breakup was a few months ago too. I'm in the Poconos. :)  EOS 3 1 50 [Others] I've always wanted to go to Las Vegas. My brother and his girlfriend just took a trip out there not too long ago. 
[reference_response]	i've always wanted to go to las vegas. my brother and his girlfriend just took a trip out there not too long ago.
[hypothesis_response]	i can relate to that. i went through a similar situation in pennsylvania when i moved here. it'd be hard for me to get away from my family, but i eventually made it through.

[contxt]	0 0 10 I see, I should set more alarms for myself. I have not put the time to exorcise as I would like to. I was planning on ordering a pair of weighted jump ropes for myself.  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] Even a walk may help you sleep...I know it does for me, Jump ropes are a great idea! I was advised it's better to exercise earlier in the day, not too close to bedtime or it can affect sleep.  EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you have trouble getting to sleep or waking up in the night? Or is it more a case of just not feeling rested after your sleep?  EOS 0 0 13 I mostly work and go to school during the day so there really isn't too much time unless I decide to exorcise early in the morning. By the end of the day, I already feel exhausted from work and most of my motivation to exorcise is gone.  EOS 0 0 14 I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night.  EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see. Sleep problems are very common you certainly aren't alone in this. With some changes I am confidant you can improve your sleep.  EOS 0 0 16 Do you have any suggestions other than exorcising to help with sleeping?  EOS 0 0 17 Anything would be taken into consideration if possible.  EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I listen to a really good podcast called Tracks to Relax. It's guided meditation that helps me deeply relax before I sleep.  EOS 0 1 19 [Self-disclosure] sometimes I use it in the middle of the night too, if I can't fall back asleep!  EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] Have you tried meditation before bed?  EOS 0 0 21 Oh wow, I never really thought listening to relaxing music to help go back to sleep. I will try that out tonight! I have never done meditation before bed, mostly during the day.  EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] Is your room dark? Light blocking curtains can help.  EOS 0 0 23 Its decently covered and at night it is pretty dark.  EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions] And a small snack of carbs, like a peice of toast or some cereal, before bed can help too. As you can see I have tried many things myself as I too have had sleep issues.  EOS 0 0 25 I will try that out as well if listening to relaxing sounds doesn't help. Thank you very much for responding to my questions and needs!  EOS 0 1 26 [Reflection of feelings] I certainly know how feeling tired can impact one's life, I have found it frustrating when I have a lot to do and just don't have the energy.

[situation]	It started during my childhood, when I was 9 years old, living my father. He had a bad temper and was impatient with me, especially with school. He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes. After the age of 10, I ended up living with my mother but I would spend most of my time with my friends because I enjoyed their company more than anything. I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well. Today, I still try my best to tolerate going to college and do my best in classes even when my anxiety comes back.

[contxt]	4 0 89 I still pray for them daily that they can realize what they are doing, repent and turn it around.  EOS 4 1 90 [Affirmation and Reassurance] We were always close but He knew the time to bring you home  EOS 4 1 91 [Providing Suggestions] Even though we are locked down can you sign online for a church  EOS 4 0 92 It took years to find a church that God wanted me to be with, but I have found my church family, and I love them. I am closer to my church family than I am to blood relatives.  EOS 4 1 93 [Question] Does your church have online services  EOS 4 0 94 Due to technical issues, I can't sign for my church, but I do have the pleasure of streaming the service each week, so I can still see my pastor, hear his message, and worship.  EOS 4 1 95 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So you are still plugged in the church  EOS 4 0 96 Because of the way the feed is set up, I can not participate unless I am at the church building, and I need to wait until I am clear of the COVID infection first.  EOS 4 1 97 [Self-disclosure] My church is miles away but I still hear the message every Sunday  EOS 4 0 98 I watch the service live each week. Actually, I have told the pastor I have gotten spoiled and like the online streaming because I can watch the service again, later.  EOS 4 0 99 There are days when I am closed up in my room wanting to feel sorry for myself that I take great comfort in watching the service again.  EOS 4 1 100 [Question] Can you send messages so the church knows you r ok  EOS 4 0 101 I do, and my pastor is wonderful about chatting with me on Facebook every day or so.  EOS 4 0 102 Just a couple weeks ago, he brought me a giant care package full of food and snacks to help keep me going and relieve the boredom.  EOS 4 1 103 [Question] can you sign language the service and send it back for the church to reach others  EOS 4 0 104 No... I'm not fluent enough for that. I do the songs because I can research them and practice ahead.  EOS 4 0 105 I can't interpret.  EOS 4 1 106 [Providing Suggestions] Do u have away to record the service and sign language. Sign language the songs  EOS 4 0 107 I am blessed to have friends who give me technical advice. I have a friend who is a certified interpreter who has sent me video showing me the correct way to sign certain songs.  EOS 4 1 108 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have a way to sign for others.  EOS 4 0 109 At the moment, I have no way, but that's okay. Since there is no one in the congregation who signs at the moment, I am not needed in that role.  EOS 4 1 110 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are Just like that little girl  EOS 4 0 111 I have no doubt if there were someone depending on me to get the message across, God would have shown us a way to get me streamed in.  EOS 4 0 112 I will be where He wants me to be and serve Him as he chooses to use me.  EOS 4 1 113 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ask and you will receive  EOS 4 0 114 True  EOS 4 1 115 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are very gifted.

[contxt]	3 0 3 Application after application I get rejected, it makes it hard to even fill out more  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Yes, job applications can feel particularly demeaning to complete. Personally, I get frustrated with all the repetition and then repetitive rejection. It seems like I had no value.  EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But you have to consider that there are dozens of different reasons why you don't get selected for a job, and quite a few of them have nothing to do with you , either as a person or as an employee.  EOS 3 0 6 It feels good someone else knows how frustrating and what a cycle it creates but I am also sorry that you do know how it is also.  EOS 3 0 7 Thank you for that, it seems most of the jobs I am applying for I am over qualified for which doesn't make sense to me and makes me think it is something personal about me.  EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] No, don't think that. I know of several employers that have actually said they don't want employees smarter than them. It requires more money and more management, and quite a few people are very happy to not do either of those things for ostensibly higher quality workforce.  EOS 3 1 9 [Question] On an actionable level, have you been getting blocked at the application point or the interviewing point?  EOS 3 0 10 Hopefully I find an employer that sees a quality workforce over other things, its getting pretty discouraging  EOS 3 0 11 I seem to be getting blocked at application level for employment, it seems my skills are mostly being put out to contract work now, which is not something I am familiar with.  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I see. Maybe there are some qualification programs in your local area, or maybe at the local university or college where you could take classes? There is a career development center at my local university that is open to everyone, maybe you could see if they would review your resume and give you some objective feedback? Students love a good live subject :-)  EOS 3 0 13 Wow I have never thought about that! That sounds awesome and like it would be great help, also trying something new would feel nice instead of filing the same stuff into applications!  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] You should explore what resources your city/county/province may offer for job seekers. It is in the best interest of almost every community that its members have have jobs and feel useful, so you may find some valuable information and maybe some connections.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Oh! And what I always tell everyone who is looking for a job: Apply UP! Don't ever think is something above your level. Apply UP! They may admire your temerity and invite you for an interview just to see who you think you are :-)  EOS 3 0 16 My spirits are going up just having this conversation and looking forward to the community outreach. Hopefully it helps lift this gloom that has been over me for months. I loved my previous job but due to bad management it was taking a toll on everyone employed.  EOS 3 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] I am glad to hear you are feeling a little better! Yes, bad management is so toxic. Even with great coworkers in a job you love, horrible management can ruin it quickly. 
[reference_response]	i am glad to hear you are feeling a little better! yes, bad management is so toxic. even with great coworkers in a job you love, horrible management can ruin it quickly.
[hypothesis_response]	yes, it does take a toll, but it is better than nothing.

His most recent behaviour is so different from what I am used to  EOS 2 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Oh that's hard to deal with. My daughter ran with a bad crowd for a while and I remember the deep worry.  EOS 2 1 5 [Question] What sort of behaviour are you noticing? How old is he?  EOS 2 0 6 My son is 15. Recently he's keeping to himself and mostly stays locked in his room. He barely allows anyone in.  EOS 2 1 7 [Question] And when you try and talk to him about it what does he say?  EOS 2 0 8 He says he's studying online. But I suspect he's doing other stuff online apart from study  EOS 2 1 9 [Question] Oh I see. Apart from isolating how is he doing otherwise, like at school? Is he still seeing his friends at all?

[contxt]	4 0 1 Not so great. I broke up with my boyfriend a couple days ago.  EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have been feeling down since the breakup a couple days ago?  EOS 4 0 3 Yes I have. I just do not know what to do with myself anymore.  EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I can relate to this heartache as I have gone through similar breakups in my life. The important thing is that we pick ourselves up after something like this.  EOS 4 0 5 I just do not know where or how to start the process.  EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It can be really hard sometimes! It appears that you possess the strength and motivation to be able to pick yourself back up. The factthat you are reaching out for help shows you have the motivation and desire to work to get better!  EOS 4 0 7 I do not want to feel like this forever!  EOS 4 1 8 [Information] Studies indicate that emotions felt immidiately after a breakup eventually subside with time. It is important to take care of yourself in the mean time. Do you have any hobbies?  EOS 4 0 9 Yes. I love to read.  EOS 4 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you like to read? Have you thought about reading self-help books on perhaps depression?  EOS 4 0 11 I do read self help books.  EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Have the books provided you any benefit?  EOS 4 0 13 Not really.  EOS 4 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] I get the sense that you are pretty depressed over you recent breakup that you have taken pretty hard. I also feel your desire to want to feel better. I think this is a step in the right direction for you to get to feeling better.  EOS 4 0 15 I think so too i just do not know where to go from here.  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes it helps in working through these feelings when we reach out to a professional mental health provider. Is this something you have considered?  EOS 4 0 17 I have thought about it before.  EOS 4 1 18 [Question] What has stopped you from doing this in the past?  EOS 4 0 19 I am nervouse about it  EOS 4 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am hearing that while you have thought about reaching out for professional help in the past in regaurds to your mental health, you have not felt comfortable enough to do this as this makes you feel a bit anxious or nervous is that correct?  EOS 4 0 21 Yes that is correct.  EOS 4 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I am nervous in situations that are new to me as well so I understand this. Is there something you can do to get past this nervousness so that you fel comfortable seeking out this help? 
[reference_response]	i am nervous in situations that are new to me as well so i understand this. is there something you can do to get past this nervousness so that you fel comfortable seeking out this help?

EOS 1 0 5 I told my friend I kind of have a thing for this guy in our friend group and he actually told the guy! This guys has a girlfriend and I'm really cool with her. Now everything is soooo awkward  EOS 1 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have been in situations where similar comments have been made.  EOS 1 0 7 My friend has been drinking a lot and he cant keep his drunk mouth shut. I'm like ready to completely dump him as a friend in a minute  EOS 1 0 8 I mean, it's covid. He should just stay tf home  EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Could you tell him that he could see a professional that could help him quit drinking?  EOS 1 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] What ways could you find some support groups for your friend regarding his issues?  EOS 1 0 11 I mean, I have sort of said it before in a really joking way. But now i'm worried it may be a problem  EOS 1 0 12 I feel like if he wants help he should find it himself  EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] It might be worthwhile to recommend him look into getting some counseling about his issues that you seem to think are a real issue.  EOS 1 0 14 he has completely isolated me from ppl i care about  EOS 1 1 15 [Question] How long has this isolating been occurring?  EOS 1 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know that your friend has a lot of issues to address, but you can give him an impetus to look at changing for the BETTER.  EOS 1 0 17 Well, one time he got drunk and kept calling me ugly in a joking way while we were at a party with a group of new ppl. He seems to have an agenda to embarass me.  EOS 1 1 18 [Information] There is a group like AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) that could be a great support for your friend.  EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I have dealt with friends like this, but the sooner he can get help for his alcohol issues, it could better your relationship with him.  EOS 1 0 20 I think I have to ask him to get help and withdraw my friendship, completely if he chooses to continue the way he is.  EOS 1 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] I am glad to provide suggestions like AA and other support groups.  EOS 1 0 22 Thank you very much  EOS 1 1 23 [Question] What else can I help you with?

EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There's nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend?  EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking.  EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that's not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it?  EOS 5 0 7 they're still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander  EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] that's an option but I hope it doesn't go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend?  EOS 5 0 9 no. i don't want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too  EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that. You don't want two people disrespecting you.  EOS 5 0 11 absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don't allow to be disrespected by anyone  EOS 5 1 12 [Question] I hear that! What happened in court when you went?  EOS 5 1 13 [Others] If you don't mind me asking  EOS 5 0 14 i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn't strong enough.  EOS 5 1 15 [Question] Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can. Has she been in contact with you?  EOS 5 0 16 no. she hasn't done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her  EOS 5 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Seems like a good idea. Steer clear of her and don't associate with her! Sounds like you're doing the right thing. Keep your side of the street clean  EOS 5 0 18 absolutely will avoid her. if she ever convinces my friends should i tell them i don't want to associate with them anymore?  EOS 5 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I would if I were in your shoes. You don't need two of the same person. Know what I mean?  EOS 5 0 20 yeah exactly. people need to realize who's side to stay on  EOS 5 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] LOL if only everyone had that thought process. Some people don't get it!  EOS 5 0 22 it's easier said than done. a lot of people are afraid of being alone and will put up with garbage  EOS 5 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Definitely sounds like you have the right tools and mindset to do the right thing!  EOS 5 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] I know about the alone thing especially in these times.  EOS 5 0 25 yeah it sucks lol  EOS 5 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] Take those tools you have, steer clear of her and do your own thing!

Everything feels like a chore and I'm sad all of the time.  EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] From what you are telling me, you are very upset about your girlfriend breaking up with you and you don't feel motivated to do anything, is that right?  EOS 3 0 6 Yeah  EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell how anxious and upset that is making you feel.  EOS 3 0 8 I feel like a heavy weight is on me all the time. I'm not enjoying things I used to in the past.  EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I can definitely understand that feeling as I had an ex who cheated on me and had a child with another man, so I know how hard that is.  EOS 3 0 10 How did you start to feel better?  EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I focused a lot on myself and making more time to do some of the hobbies that I didn't get a chance to do when we were together.

EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know things are really hard right now, but I know you will make it through this!  EOS 3 0 14 Thanks, I appreciate it. What do you suggest I should do to begin with?  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] Have you talked to her since she broke up with you? Sometimes it helps to talk with your ex so you can get closure on the situation.  EOS 3 0 16 No I haven't talked to her. I think that would only make me feel worse right now.  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] I understand that, have you tried to talk to a friend or family member who has gone through the same thing?  EOS 3 0 18 No, I haven't yet but that is a good idea.

EOS 4 1 5 [Question] Is there something on your mind you'd like to chat about? I'm here to listen.  EOS 4 0 6 i had a breakup just a year ago and its taking its toll on me  EOS 4 1 7 [Question] I'm sorry to hear that. Recovering from a break up can take a long time. How long were you together?  EOS 4 0 8 4 years  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a long time. I think its normal to take time to recover after a long relationship, after all it was a significant part of your life for 4 years.  EOS 4 0 10 yes, we were both planning on getting married  EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I've struggled with the same situation. Do you want to tell me what kind of feelings you are struggling with?  EOS 4 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] That is a lot to deal with, I am so sorry.  EOS 4 0 13 i am very saddened by the breakup  EOS 4 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] I hear and feel your grief. Would you call it grief? Please let me know.  EOS 4 0 15 close to grief but she is still alive  EOS 4 0 16 i saw her last week and it was like a bomb was dropped on me  EOS 4 1 17 [Question] i understand. Grief is the emotion of sadness and loss, does that resonate with you?  EOS 4 0 18 exactly  EOS 4 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I was just going to ask you if you still see her, that must have been so difficult.  EOS 4 0 20 very difficult  EOS 4 0 21 she looks soo beautiful  EOS 4 1 22 [Self-disclosure] The hollidays were very hard for me after my break up, we were going to marry like you. Isort the season and all the expectations and memories of exacerbated the loss for me. Do you think that might be making you feel worse?  EOS 4 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered that You must be beautiful/handsome for her to be attracted to you.  EOS 4 0 24 i think our problem started when we moved in together  EOS 4 0 25 i always felt soo lucky to have her because she is always perfect  EOS 4 1 26 [Information] I just want to say that the hollidays will be over soon and that may help.  EOS 4 1 27 [Reflection of feelings] I'm sorry, it sounds like you loved her very much.  EOS 4 0 28 i loved her just too much  EOS 4 0 29 and the holiday is not helping the matter because i felt soo lonely  EOS 4 1 30 [Information] Experts say that feeling your feelings and talking about them is really good for you to help get over a long breakup. Also that it takes a year or more to process. So know that you are doing the right things.  EOS 4 0 31 really  EOS 4 1 32 [Providing Suggestions] I was really lonely after my breakup too. I had to make myself spend time with other people that cared about me like friends and family. Even though I kind of just wanted to stay sad making myself be around other people that reminded me of the good, perfect and lovable things about myself made me feel better and gave me hope. Maybe easing your lonliness would give you some relief?  EOS 4 0 33 so you are advising me to go out more and mixed up with people  EOS 4 1 34 [Others] You sound like a sensitive and loving person.

[contxt]	3 0 1 Hi there. I don't really know how to start with this, but I've been feeling low for the last year or so, and feel like my mood is getting worse with each day. I don't have any motivation to do anything and I'm not sure exactly where to turn.  EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] it sounds like you are a little depressed  EOS 3 0 3 I think that might be true. Can you offer any advice or guidance on what I can do to improve it?  EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i think a lot of people are feeling that way. covid has really changed up everyone's lives, and it is hard to make drastic changes like we all have.  EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] if y ou have health insurance you can always look into therapy or antidepressants  EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] there are also free sites like 7 cups that does peer to peer supprt  EOS 3 0 7 Yeah my issues have definitely been compounded by the crisis, and not being able to speak to my friends or family, or even my work colleagues now I work from home. I don't have health insurance unfortunately, otherwise I'd have gone down that route.  EOS 3 1 8 [Information] sometimes talking to people even through chat can make us feel less lonely and change things up a bit  EOS 3 0 9 7 cups, I haven't heard of that one. What do they do?  EOS 3 0 10 Definitely even this conversation is making me feel a little better.  EOS 3 1 11 [Information] peer to peer support. you can. try to google it!  EOS 3 0 12 I will look into it after this conversation then. Is there anything you could recommend I try before I contact them? Just anything I can do to lift my spirits?  EOS 3 1 13 [Information] if you google lemonaid health that is a doctor you can see virtually its prettty cheap less than a hundres a month for a doctor and meds!  EOS 3 0 14 Do you think meds are a good option? I'm worried if I take that route I might end up zoned out or addicted to taking them.  EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] when i am feeling down i like to go sit outside. vitamin d that we get from the sun is really importnat. i am inside a lot. i have had to start taking a supplement and it helps!  EOS 3 1 16 [Information] i've been onn and off antidppressants for about twenty years. antidepressants work with natural chemicals in your brain they are not addictive because they are not narcotic  EOS 3 0 17 Okay sure, so I could just go to my local pharmacy and pick up Vitamin D? Or is that prescribed by a doctor?  EOS 3 0 18 Okay that's good to know you have first hand experience.  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] you can look an amazon for herbal or natural options .st johns wort is a good one  EOS 3 0 20 Okay, what does that do? I havent heard of that supplement before.  EOS 3 1 21 [Information] vitamin d d is over the counter! any pharmacy, amazon, its easy to find and cheap  EOS 3 1 22 [Others] my friend swears by st johns wort. its some herb that is a natural anti depressant. you could do some research and see! 
[reference_response]	my friend swears by st johns wort. its some herb that is a natural anti depressant. you could do some research and see!
[hypothesis_response]	i think it can be used as a supplement, but it does not make you feel any better. so i would suggest you look online for a supplement that will be available from amazon and take it online if you want to see if you can get it from there.
[comet query]	Okay, what does that do? I havent heard of that supplement before.

EOS 0 0 5 That sounds like a cozy scene :)  EOS 0 0 6 I'm okay, but slightly worried about next year. My job is sort of tenuous and I have about a month to find a new role.  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Yes it is nice. Are you doing anything festive today?  EOS 0 0 8 No, nothing much. Same as always, on and off work, having a meal with the girlfriend, that sort. (It would help if this system shows us if one of us is typing..)  EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that times are rough lately. Sounds like there is some time to figure it out, take full advantage of all the time you can. I hope it works out and a new position becomes available, I know your story is shared by many right now. What a crazy time we are in  EOS 0 1 10 [Others] yes it does, on top it says inputing  EOS 0 0 11 Ah fair, that's good to know  EOS 0 0 12 Yes, still it doesn't quite help that no matter how many CVs you submit, hit rates for jobs just don't go up.  EOS 0 1 13 [Others] what are cv's? I see, I am getting by by dping a billion a day lol  EOS 0 1 14 [Question] but there is other income, im not sure it would support me otherwise. Are there other lines of work you could look into?  EOS 0 0 15 I get what you mean about other lines of work. I'm trained as an academic research associate and had to spend a few months last year working in an Amazon warehouse. I feel like I've wasted enough time outside of aimed-for career to go back to doing manual labour.  EOS 0 0 16 *this year even..  EOS 0 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] well the title sounds legit, lol, but yes i see and understand. Did you do the trainging in the warehouse for the research job?  EOS 0 0 18 No, completely unrelated jobs. It was more of a "really need a job right now" situation, and they were hiring quite unassumingly.  EOS 0 1 19 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh i see.  EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] If this odd job tasks site exists maybe there a more related oppurtunites to get into that pay more. Or really, the green field is a good one to get into right now I think like solar companies and such. They are going to become more prevalent soon.  EOS 0 0 21 Are you working in such a role? I doubt my qualifications translate THAT well haha  EOS 0 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I make a good case right so you might think I was but no, I am not I only wish to be. I wish to be much more than I am but ya know I work with what I can find to do. Id savd the world every day if zi could knowing my efforts were toowrads a good cause.  EOS 0 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] I always tell my other half, they might just take a chance and hire out of their skill zone if you have drive and interest in the field.  EOS 0 0 24 I do like that idea. I might actually go and give that a shot and see what happens.  EOS 0 1 25 [Others] as we were told growing up the worst they could say is no,

We live in different parts of the country and have been separated because of the coronavirus crisis.  EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you saying that you are having a difficult time as your boyfriend broke up with you and that due to the coronavirus you have been separated. Is that correct?  EOS 4 0 4 that is correct. Do you have any advice or suggestions about how I can get through the ending of our relationship?  EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know you are hurting right and it seems like everything is happening all at the same time with the virus and now this. You will find the strength to get through.  EOS 4 0 6 I appreciate your support and encouragement.  EOS 4 0 7 Have you ever gone through a break up?

EOS 3 0 9 I tried to hurt myself...not that I wanted to...I just don't have any friends  EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Wow I'm sorry to hear that.  EOS 3 0 11 Have you ever tried to hurt yourself?  EOS 3 0 12 because things just aren't worth it?  EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I haven't, but I've thought about it before. I think most people have. Did you get professional help yesterday or today?  EOS 3 0 14 no, my parents don't believe me that it is important enough. How would you do it...hurt yourself?  EOS 3 0 15 I thought about crashing my car into someone else  EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don't have a plan, I just have though about how I have the power to end it.  EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Why would you want to crash into someone else and potentially kill them too?  EOS 3 0 18 It doesn't matter  EOS 3 0 19 It would be quick for me  EOS 3 0 20 I would take off my seatbelt first  EOS 3 1 21 [Question] that would be considered a murder suicide  EOS 3 0 22 I wouldn't be here to see it  EOS 3 0 23 Just want to end it  EOS 3 0 24 Looking to do it tomorrow...around lunch time  EOS 3 0 25 when my parents are at work  EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] you should call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-8255  EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions] or 911  EOS 3 0 28 why?

[contxt]	4 0 10 Thanks for making confidence. I feel relaxed. I believe this will surely be a chance to find myself and get a better opportunity to be relieved from my previous difficulties. Only GOD should have forced me this way, I believe.  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your faith is healthy and gives you purpose. Similarly you have to believe that the dots will connect in your favor. Maybe you can't connect them looking forward, but looking backwards you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.  EOS 4 0 12 I felt anger over my previous employer since he was not giving any time for me to switch over, at least 2 months.  EOS 4 0 13 Even then he was satisfied till then.  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] It can be frustrating to focus on your last job, especially if you haven't found a new one yet. Perhaps once you find a new job your disappointment with the last one won't be so disappointing anymore. If the new job is better you wouldn't have found it working the last job.  EOS 4 0 15 Anyhow my loyalty was not encouraged to perform more. I have to move from some back again.  EOS 4 0 16 Any I am preparing myself better, using the break time to gain my knowledge further and sharpen my skills, reading and viewing many articles in the net and youtube. I helps me a lot.  EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's great that you're staying productive and improving yourself. If your desire to improve yourself is as strong as your desire to find a new job I'm confident you will.  EOS 4 0 18 It helps me to forget the past and concentrate on the future.  EOS 4 1 19 [Others] Don't let your past define you, let your present choices pave a new path into the future.  EOS 4 0 20 I am going forward only.

EOS 0 0 2 My mother in law is sick with COVID and my husband, when he contracted COVID from her, got terminated from his job.  EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] I can see why you feel anxious, I would be too given the situation.  EOS 0 1 4 [Question] When did your mother in law got sick with COVID?  EOS 0 0 5 Yeah, it's just really stressful and I am over anxious about it.  EOS 0 0 6 Right before Thanksgiving, she is elderly and has cancer, she is finally feeling better though.  EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Cancer is already a hard enough disease to fight against. My aunt is a cancer survivor. I am sure your mother can make it too.  EOS 0 0 8 She is a fighter.  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] From my knowledge, people usually recover from COVID after 2 to 3 weeks, you might consider having a doctor see your mother if she is still struggling.  EOS 0 0 10 Yeah, she went again the other day. She is doing quite a bit better. He said because of underlying conditions it may take her longer, but she is doing great. That was encouraging.  EOS 0 1 11 [Information] There are substantially more people recovering from covid each day despite the number of infected growing exponentially. I am sure that, with the proper care, your mother in law will make it, and so will your husband.  EOS 0 1 12 [Others] I am sure he will be able to find a new job soon as new business start to open, even if it's a temporary one.  EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, I guess you're right. I know you're right. I just haven't felt really in the Christmas spirit this year and I am anxious about everything I can't control.  EOS 0 0 14 He did have an interview today too, so that is good news.  EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Those are some great news indeed. I am sure he will get a call soon : )  EOS 0 0 16 Lol - you made me smile. Thanks. I will believe that too.

[contxt]	1 0 1 My friends won't even call me half the time even though I am always reaching out to them and trying to get together. \  EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are trying to reach out to friends and they don't reciprocate as much as you'd like?  EOS 1 0 3 Not only that, they don't seem to ever call me. I am the one doing all the efforts.  EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That can be hard when friends don't reach out despite all your efforts. Have you discussed this concern with them?  EOS 1 0 5 I haven't really tried to bring it up, but maybe I should.  EOS 1 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes friends don't realize that they aren't fulfilling their end of the relationship and just need to become more aware.  EOS 1 0 7 That makes sense.  EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Do you think you might want to have a conversation with your friends and see if they feel the same way?  EOS 1 0 9 Yes, that seems to be a good idea.  EOS 1 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I've had friends in the past who didn't call and I found out later that they were having personal struggles and it wasn't anything against me.  EOS 1 0 11 I see your point. Maybe I should be asking if my friend needs anything instead of expecting so much from them. I will have to talk to them to find out what is going on.  EOS 1 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I can see it being hard not knowing for sure.  EOS 1 0 13 You make a good point.  EOS 1 1 14 [Question] Sometimes people also grow and change so relationships evolve as well. Is there something you would hope to gain from the friendship that you think could change? 
[reference_response]	sometimes people also grow and change so relationships evolve as well. is there something you would hope to gain from the friendship that you think could change?
[hypothesis_response]	i think that's a great idea. you can talk to your friends about how you feel. maybe you could try to tell them that you feel they are not fulfilling your end of your relationship, and that you should talk to their friends about that.

[contxt]	3 0 1 I'm, okay, thanks, and you? I'm feeling a bit down because I'm alone for the holidays.  EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Well that's no good, does your family live far away?  EOS 3 0 3 Yes, my family is scattered all over the country, like Seattle, Georgia, PA. I'm sure I'm not the only one with no plans this weekend, though.  EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] True but I can understand that, it is hard being alone at the holidays.  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Did you have plans this weekend?  EOS 3 0 6 No. My nearby friends all went away for the holidays. I could probably just occupy my time with things I need or want to do in order to distract myself.  EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] What kind of hobbies do you have?  EOS 3 0 8 I'm teaching myself the piano. I'm also teaching myself how to work a stenography machine for possible future employment as a stenographer. I also like to read novels.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have never understood how those work..I find it amazing someone can type out whole words or sentences with one word  EOS 3 0 10 Yeah, it's pretty cool. For example, if I hit DRAT in one stroke, then "Did there come a time" will appear in English on my machine's LCD screen.  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow that is crazy, I don't understand how that works, is it preprogrammed or does it go by how the word sounds?  EOS 3 0 12 Each stenographer has their own "Personal Dictionary" which is a list of words in English along with how you in particular write out those words or phrases in steno. This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi. Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently.  EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user. I take it your stenography machine becomes pretty close to you lol  EOS 3 1 14 [Question] Is this your first holiday alone? 
[reference_response]	is this your first holiday alone?
[hypothesis_response]	well, i have had some help from my family, but i would like to say i have a better understanding of it.

And he has a very rough idea of things that have happened.. he tells me he wants to know everything so he can help me move forward.. but when i try to talk about it i ramble and end up not explaining anything.
