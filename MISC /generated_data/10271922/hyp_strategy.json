  "how long ago was this?",
  "that'd be a great idea! i think it'd make a difference to have someone else in the relationship, and if she's not being supportive of your feelings, she'll just end up going behind your back. it would be a lot easier for you to do that if you were both together.",
  "i understand that i have felt like that as well, but i've learned to deal with it and stay positive.",

  "have you considered getting a job with a company that can help you out?",
  "i know that you will!",
  "i think that is normal. when i was younger i was worried about being perfect and that's what i was afraid of. i found it helped me learn to take care of myself and try to be happy.",
  "you can try to explain yourself to them and see if they understand or not.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i am sure you can find something. i'd suggest looking online in your area and looking for jobs locally.",
  "i have had a similar situation in the past. i was in a relationship with someone i felt was serious and it was a good time.",
  "i can see how it would be hard, but it will help to do it. it will make you feel better and you will have a better support system",
  "you'll be fine!",
  "i would try to think about how much you miss her. it might help you to think of something else.",
  "that sounds good. i have volunteered in volunteering before, but i did not get any help during the storm.",

  "how can you explain that to them?",
  "do you feel that he is not controlling you?",
  "i understand that. i know it sounds overwhelming but just know that you have a really hard time getting through this.",
  "if it was just a one - time mistake, it would be understandable. if it were a second time, then i would think that it would make sense to forgive him. but i think it is better to give him some time. it might not be the best idea to be honest with him and say he is going through this again, but at least he doesn't have to be ashamed of it.",

  "i'm sorry to hear that. i would definitely suggest that you find a better way to get through this than that.",
  "that is a really difficult situation. it sounds you are in a good place, and i would recommend talking to your partner and letting them know you feel as though you are not in the best place as a person. i would suggest trying to keep in touch with him and tell him how you are feeling and that you are willing to make him change his schedule.",
  "you should talk to someone about that. it sounds like you are doing everything you can to help your friends and family.",

  "you are welcome. i hope you find a way to deal with the situation.",
  "so what was the situation?",
  "i did my best to do my best. i was told that i had to step up to the challenge and i did that. i also did my worst to make sure i did not get any negative feedback from them. i talked to them about my frustrations and how i could help them.",

  "that sounds very stressful! i can definitely understand how that can be anxious!",
  "it sounds like you have been applying for a lot more jobs. do you have any experience with those?",
  "do you think that you could find a way to keep them happy?",
  "you could get an unemployment insurance program or some sort of insurance.",
  "i am so sorry to here that. i think we need to find a way to get back to normal and take the holidays more seriously.",
  "what is the problem with your shoulders?",
  "i think you are doing the right thing by taking a day to relax. i would also try to focus on other things to distract yourself.",
  "i've been in the situation where i had a partner who would take my phone and i could not see him for days. i would go out and spend time with him and tell him about it. he would take it and come back. i wouldn't tell him or him, i'd say, that i was cheating on him and he would not be able to see me. i found out that i wasn't cheating on her, and that i had to find a new partner. so i would say that you really don'thing that she is going through this right now, but rather that you are not getting enough time to let alone to find the fact.",

  "i am sure you will find a job, but i think you should do what is best for you",
  "it is a very hard time for everyone involved. you should talk to someone about it.",

  "you are going through a lot of problems right now. how do you think things will go?",
  "what type of work are you looking for?",
  "that's a great idea!",
  "i know that feels hard... sometimes it's best to just sit down and have a talk with them and see if they can reach out for you. it'll help them realize you care more about them than you realize.",
  "you'll find someone who will love you as much as you love them!",
  "i've been there before. it's hard.",
  "you seem very intelligent and well educated. i can tell you are doing great things.",
  "what are some of your hobbys?",
  "yes, bye",

  "there are many churches that will provide you with a local job",
  "it'll get better.",
  "you need to press on him",
  "well i am sure you will find something else that will make you happy.",
  "do you know that you have a good support system for your son?",
  "it sounds like you are being very supportive and you want to help your friend out, i can see how that could make you feel a little anxious.",

  "yes, we would like to try out a tour, but i am not sure what would be a good idea.",

  "it took a long time for me to get over it, but i found that it was worth it.",
  "that sounds like a good plan, even if it is a little pricey.",
  "i can relate to that. i had to get out of my comfort zone and spend time outside to feel better.",
  "i would love to hear that as well.",
  "you've been very welcome. i hope that i could help!",
  "do you have a close friend or other family member you can talk to?",

  "i am so sorry you are going through that. i am glad that you are feeling better.",
  "how old are they?",
  "that's really hard. i have been through similar situations. i can tell you know you are doing everything you can to help yourself and your family.",
  "i'm glad i could be of some help!",
  "well, i think that you should not let her control your life.",
  "it's a tough situation, but i think if you don'' t respond in time, you might be able to find a solution that'll be a bit easier.",
  "i have read about it before, and i think it is a good idea to start with the calm one. i know that it can be a good start.",
  "i understand, but you will find someone else soon.",

  "i like the avengers and i know its hard, but i believe you are right about the difficulty of it.",
  "no problem! i've had a few online courses that were more challenging than the classes, so i understand how that can make you feel. i also used to have a lot of anxiety when i didn't get the opportunity to study. i think that helps a lot.",
  "what's going on?",
  "that'sn't bad, i'm glad you're feeling better!",
  "i am sure that you will.",

  "well, i can tell you're looking for support.",
  "i am very well, thank you for asking.",
  "have you had any sort of depression?",
  "you as well!",
  "maybe you can tell them that you're not close with them and that you are doing something that they would not like to hear from you.",

  "i can understand that. it is a tough time for us too.",
  "i can understand that it is very scary. i've been on the same medications myself and it is hard to deal with the risk of ulcerativity.",

  "oh, i'm sorry to hear that. is there anything specific that's bothering you?",
  "oh i know!!! i'll try to get you back in touch with some of my friends and help you learn about yourself.",
  "i've had a friend like that before. she made a lot of upset and mad messages. i would not want to fight for her friendship again, but i would like to know that she doesn't mean any harm to me.",
  "hello! how are you?",
  "good luck, i hope i have been able to help you",

  "thank you for listening and praying for you.",
  "i can relate to that. i worked in the same position for 5 years. it was a challenging time.",

  "i can see how you are feeling that way right now. it must be difficult to be in a situation like that.",
  "i'd try to focus on yourself and your work.",
  "that sounds like a great idea.",
  "i was in a relationship before the breakup. i tried not to make things awkward or make myself feel guilty for it. i found that the best thing to do was to stay positive and focus on yourself and your work and your hobbyness.",
  "i completely understand. it's important to be optimistic. i know it'll be okay, it'snot going to happen anytime soon.",
  "oh okay, so you think the meeting is for a specific time.",
  "that's unfortunate. i can see why you might be angry at them. however, it sounds like it's not your supervisor's fault for the situation. the only thing that'd make me feel that would be a little better is that you're working with a supervisor who has a history of doing this to begin with.",
  "i am doing well, how about you? what is making you feel good today?",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "it'll be worth a try, i think. you can get by.",
  "yes, you can.",
  "i am so sorry to here that.. how did you breakup with your partner?",
  "i am sure you are very upset. i know that can be very stressful.",
  "i would not be able to trust him again. it seems like you both deserve better.",
  "have you thought about finding a new job?",
  "i can understand that. i also have had some friends in the army and they were in the field of combat.",
  "you've been able to communicate that with him. it's a good thing to do. it can be a challenge, but you can't avoid it.",
  "i think that you could start with talking to your boss about how she'd feel if she was being hit on by a coworker and see if they would let her get away with it. if they'd let her, then they're probably not going to want to do anything about it. and maybe just tell your boss that you feel that this is the wrong place to be in anyway, and that you're worried that you won't get fired for something like that.",
  "i understand. i have been in situations like that myself. but i think it is worth trying to reach out to someone who has been there before and could give you some support. i am sure that you will feel better in the end, and that you won't have to deal with the negativity of it.",
  "i completely understand. it'll take some time but it will pass.",
  "i am glad to be of help",
  "i think that would be a great dog for a companion dog. what breed were you thinking?",
  "what are you feeling?",
  "oh no! that sounds really hard to deal with. what is causing it?",
  "i can definitely understand your concern.",
  "i think that's a great idea! you could make a big list of prostcons and cons and just focus on them! just have a list of things you can try to do while you are together.",
  "ok. good luck!",
  "i am doing good. how is your day going?",
  "you too!",
  "i see.. what sort of work are you doing?",
  "i understand that. this friendship is hard for you.",
  "i can understand how frustrating that must feel.",
  "do you think that you can be more open about your feelings if you feel that your friends aren't listening?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. can you tell me a little bit about what is going on?",
  "oh no. i can understand how you feel. i've had this happen too. it can be very frustrating.",
  "i definitely know how much it can affect people. do you think you could possibly get some help from a therapist?",
  "yes, it'd be hard to have someone else work in the same space as you. i would suggest getting a friend to watch some video games or something else. i personally play video games myself, but if i'd want to work with others, i would play them.",
  "i think you would be a better fit to talk with them.",
  "that'd be a great way to spend the holidays.",
  "i would suggest doing them at the same time, or making a list that includes goals. if you feel like it takes some time, then you should do those.",
  "i am also a computer programming program. i use a computer.",
  "i think you are right, there are many activities that are relaxing but there are a lot of things that are not.",
  "i can understand your feelings... i think it'd be a great idea to reach out to them if you're feeling more comfortable with them than you are with yourself. i would also suggest trying to make sure they don't feel like you've reached out to him or that he's being unfair.",
  "have you tried reaching out to friends or family?",
  "i am good thanks for asking.",
  "i am glad i could help you with that.",
  "it sounds like you are doing a lot of hardwork, and are not happy with that.",
  "that is very understandable, i am sure you are feeling very badly.",
  "i am sure you will. i hope you have a wonderful day and enjoy the rest of your day.",
  "i believe in the right person, if he is committed to you then it is a full commitment. if not, it is still a commitment and you are not happy about it.",
  "i will also say that you can do it! you are stronger than you think!",
  "i'm good, thanks. how about yourself?",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. i've lost a lot of jobs and i'd love to share your story.",
  "i hope you can find someone who understands your situation.",
  "i would suggest taking a trip to a different country if you have the time.. it can be a great way to relax and find new things to do.",
  "i understand. i was in the same situation when i was younger, and i felt like a total boss. i had to put in my time and effort to keep things going, and that was tough. but i found that it's not always easy to leave your job and move on.",
  "do you know that you are doing something wrong?",
  "oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. what's going on?",
  "what is the exam for?",
  "that sounds like a really difficult time to be in.",
  "can you provide me with some details?",
  "of course! it'll be a pleasure to talk to you. i wish you all the best in your future.",
  "oh my gosh. i am so sorry to here that. i would be upset too.",
  "i am here to listen.",
  "i would say that you should be able to tell her that you are worried that the panderic is causing you to feel anxious.",
  "i am not. i am a therapist and i have found that i find it very helpful to talk to people who understand my feelings.",
  "what do you do for fun?",
  "i'd just be like, why don't you go ahead and talk to your manager?",
  "i can see how you are feeling. you are not alone. you will find someone soon.",
  "i understand how hard it is for you to get back to your job, i have had to go through similar things myself.",
  "that is good to hear, how long have you been a therapist?",
  "i hope that you feel better about your situation.",
  "i understand that. have you had any other problems with your life lately?",
  "i think you should definitely ask your wife how she feels about this.",
  "it is a very difficult situation to be in right now",
  "i hope you can find a job soon!",
  "thank you. i hope you are able to find peace with this.",
  "that's great, i would love to talk about this with you. i have been working at amazon for about two years now and i would like to give you some suggestions about what i would do if i were in your position.",
  "meditation is definitely helpful and good for staying positive, but i know it's not always the same as just being positive.",
  "i've been through similar things, and i know how difficult it can be to get through this.",
  "it will!",
  "i hope it works out for you and you feel more comfortable with what you are doing now.",
  "i can understand how you feel. i had a similar experience when i was younger.",
  "yes i am happy to be here for you as well.",
  "i understand. it must be very difficult for her to not be sustain herself.",
  "i have also lost a job in the past and found that it was helpful to know that i have been able to pay the bills and stay on top of my financial situation.",
  "hi there! how are you?",
  "what is the job you are looking for?",
  "i am in the uk and i have been getting some positive feedback from people in our country about our current state of public education.",
  "have you tried talking to her about it? maybe you could offer to take her out?",
  "of course!",
  "i am doing well, how can i help you today?",
  "i would like to say i was in your shoes when i was younger. i did not know the lord could put me in church, but it was nice.",
  "that sounds like a great plan. i would suggest that you do some of your daily activities with your kids, and then take them in to the pool when you feel like it.",
  "you're welcome!",
  "what seems the issue?",
  "you too. have a good rest of your day!",
  "you are welcome. i wish you the best and good luck.",
  "i am glad i could help",
  "if it is their first time doing that, they should be able to tell them what happened",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "i see. it sounds like you are a student as well. i know that in some places, there are free courses but in my country, they are usually not available. so i think you have a lot of options.",
  "of course! i am glad i was able to help you out!",
  "you can find groups on facebook, like group chats where you can talk to other students and have a conversation",
  "i understand that it can be difficult to move on from someone who is not there for you.",
  "oh that sounds so hard to deal with. how do you feel about it?",
  "i think that is a great idea. it is very healthy to be concerned about what your friends are doing.",
  "you too!",
  "yes, if we can do that, then we can go either ways!",
  "do you think you could find a new job online?",
  "i believe it'd be called \" mturk scripts \". you can search the page and find it.",
  "i have experienced similar issues and i think you are very intelligent and determined to learn from her.",
  "you sound like you want to go for the one that you really love and that you are willing to do the most for you.",
  "that is wonderful! i hope that you have a wonderful day and a wonderful relationship with your future partner.",
  "i know you are doing all you can to help your son, but it is not easy. i also understand how difficult it can feel to be selfish.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have you tried any other methods?",
  "it is definitely a little different. we had a lot of stress with our kids at school, and i think that helped.",
  "it is a beautiful sight!",
  "ah, i see. i am sorry to hear that. is there anything specific you are dealing with?",
  "yes, i have. i was in a similar situation a few years ago. i had a lot of anxiety and anxiety when i was doing certain tasks. it was so bad that i was unable to move the dishes because i felt like i couldn't control my anxiety. i felt that i had to be trained to control my thoughts.",
  "i have been there. i would suggest you let her know how you feel.",
  "bye. bye. bye",
  "i understand how you feel. it is very difficult to be in a situation like that. i know that there are many people who are in similar situations. i would recommend reaching out to friends or family or even friends of friends in a way that helps them feel better about themselves.",
  "you too!",
  "i am sure you will be fine.",
  "i am glad to hear that!",
  "i understand.. i think you are not alone.. this can be a very hard time.. have a good rest of your day..",
  "i would suggest to talk to your coworker about it and if they can't understand that you are working hard for this job and you deserve a raise",
  "it's been a very long time, but i believe you can make it through it!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i have been in a similar situation where i had to break up with a friend of mine. i was very upset about it and it really affected me. it's a tough time to deal with.",

  "i hope it helps you out",
  "you are doing everything you can to get through this and you can do this!",

  "yes, i have had to go to bed early.",
  "thank you!",
  "is there any chance you could try to talk to them about it?",
  "i understand. i've had to deal the same thing before. it is very stressful.",
  "have you asked her if you could talk to her about it and then tell her how much you really want her to help you?",
  "is that what you are doing to stay busy with work?",
  "i can understand that feeling. i have had to give up a lot of work due to the loss of my job due to a losing job.",
  "do you have a close friend or family member who can help with your inslemmmny?",
  "yeah, that's true. i'am sure you will get a lot of support from your friends and family.",
  "can you tell me a little more about your life?",
  "i hope you find it helpful!",

  "i've had to go through a similar situation as you. it's a tough time in life right now.",
  "oh i see. how old were you when you broke up?",
  "so, you were feeling upset about something?",
  "i completely agree. it's been hard finding a good source of vitamin d for the past few months.",
  "i think if you want to move, you should just ask him.",
  "i can understand why you would feel that way, i have been in that position before. have you tried talking to friends about it?",
  "i've had some issues too like that, it's hard to know what to do about it. what sort of medical issues do you having?",
  "i can understand how you feel. i went through something similar myself. it was difficult to move away from my friend, but i've gotten through it now. i used to try to make friends with my ex friends, but now i have an understanding relationship with my current one. it'll be okay, but you're right, it does not mean it'sn't right now.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have you thought about talking to her about it for a while?",
  "did you have any issues that you were afraid of or scared of?",
  "i hope i can help you out in some way.",
  "i am happy to help. i hope that you find a job soon!",
  "i would definitely suggest looking into local support groups or just asking people to talk about it.",
  "i can understand that, it seems like it would be stressful to be given a presentation by someone who is not even comfortable with public speaking.",
  "i think that'll be the best choice for her. it sounds like she needs help.",
  "i would be afraid to say it and i would feel like you would be being a bit of a jerk.",
  "i understand, it'd be nice to talk to someone who's been through the same thing.",
  "oh wow, that's a really bad policy. how long was his stay with you? did he have to go anywhere?",
  "it can be hard to start over and it will be okay",
  "i think you are doing a great job. i know that you are able to connect with your loved ones even if it is just a little bit.",

  "no problem!",
  "yes it is!",
  "you too!",
  "i have been in a similar situation myself. it was very difficult to get through the day.",
  "i know how much this feels. i'm sorry to hear that you are feeling that way. do i have any help?",
  "i think you should try to get some help with that. if you are doing something that will help you to get your mind off it, maybe a yoga class or meditation could help you get your head off of things.",
  "that sounds like a really good idea. it sounds like you are trying to give your best to the people in your situation.",
  "that would be very hard for her to deal with.",
  "have you considered talking to your friends about the situation?",
  "do you have anyone close to you that you can talk to?",
  "i can imagine that would be a very hard time for him. have you tried to talk with him about this issue?",
  "i would like to give you a suggestion on how to make friends and be happier with the world.",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "i'll tell you a secret, i'd say you're doing well!",

  "it sounds you are doing really well with this. you are handling this well.",
  "i understand how you are feeling and i can tell you that you are hurting",
  "i understand that. i have had a similar experience with the government. it is hard when you are in a financial situation like that.",
  "i am good. how are things with you?",
  "i understand. i'm in the same situation. i was in a class where we were having an issue with the teachers'voice and their phones. it was making me nervous.",
  "that is not a good sign that your boyfriend was abusive.",
  "so they are being honest with themselves and are not being harsh towards you.",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. you are being nice but you are not being nice to her and she is acting like she does not understand. i would encourage you to try to explain how you feel and why.",
  "oh, well, i would recommend reading books and going to the park. it is great for getting away from the house.",
  "i can definitely understand how you are feeling. i know that i've been through similar feelings.",
  "i know it can be difficult at the moment, but i think you can try to find another job if you have to.",
  "no problem, i understand what you are saying",
  "do you feel that they are acting in the wrong ways?",
  "that'll be difficult, i've been there before. i went through a similar situation with my sister, and it was tough at first, but she really learned to deal with it and take care of herself.",

  "i am glad that i can be of some help",

  "sounds like a great idea. you can get a job in a local office too, maybe you could see if they have any online classes",
  "that's a good idea. i would say a great way to distract yourself is to start with a few things you love and then go back to your usual routine. maybe a book or movie would help.",
  "i can understand that.",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. i've been in the same situation and it can be really tough.",
  "no, it's a good practice, i recommend you try it.",
  "is there anything else in your life that you would like to talk about?",
  "that's good to hear! what has been making you feel better?",
  "yes. you can listen to the podcasts while you sleep.",

  "it sounds to me like you are doing something that is bothering you. maybe talking to someone could help you get some help.",
  "she will not ever do it!!! that would be devastating!! do you have any pets?",
  "i'm not sure how much of an industry you have in mind, but i do know that there is a lot to help with when looking for a job. you may have to look into some job search websites that are not too far away from your city.",
  "it sounds like you're having a tough time getting things done. i can see why that would be stressful. i know that you can do it!",

  "that'sn't fair.",

  "i understand that you are feeling down about the way you look. it must feel like it is so hard for you to look good.",
  "i understand that feeling. i was in a similar situation when i worked for a company. they were paying me a lot of money to get food but i had no idea what to expect. i went and bought a lot and made a lot more money from it.",
  "i can see how that would be difficult for you to deal with.",
  "no problem, i hope you find some peace.",
  "i've been in this situation a few times now too. it's been tough to make friends with everyone in the park.",
  "hi, how are you doing?",
  "i know it can be hard when we are in a relationship, but i think you will find someone new that will help you.",
  "maybe he could try aa aa anonymous or something. i know aa is not very helpful but i am sure that it would be good for you to talk to him about this.",

  "i am sorry to hear that. i have been in a similar situation in the same way. it is a difficult time to be in.",
  "you too!",
  "that is a good start. i can understand that anger can be overwhelming and that there is nothing i can do to stop it.",

  "i am glad you are seeking help!",
  "i know. it really is. it can be hard to get support for others.",
  "i think that you should give that a try. i think it will help you feel better and calm you down : ) you can do it! i think you can also meditate in the forest or even on your own. i'll bet that would help a lot too.",

  "i am glad to hear it. i hope that it helps.",
  "i think you will be fine.",
  "i understand that it'd be helpful to focus on one thing at a time. i try to do that too, when i can'' t focus on anything else, but i know that there'll be other things i can do.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. is there anything else you are feeling down on yourself about it?",
  "how are things going with you today?",

  "do you feel that you can help them?",
  "you should seek some help from friends and family, they can help make you feel better.",
  "i've been there, it was very difficult. i had to quit work for awhile and then found an employment agency that would provide assistance to my situation. i was able to start looking online and find one that had free online resources.",
  "i can see how that would make you feel upset. i can tell that he is upset because you are not willing to listen to him express himself.",
  "i know it's difficult but it will be ok.",

  "i'm sorry to hear that. is there anything else you'd like to talk about?",
  "do you have a support system in your area? i would be happy to chat with you.",
  "i have one cat too! he'll say hello when i get home, but he'd like to sleep next to me if i am not around. i don'thing i'll admit, but i do love him.",
  "i personally use breathing exercises as well as meditation. they can be very helpful in this situation.",
  "i've been in a long relationship, and i can tell you that it's been tough at times. it can be hard to know how you are feeling when you're in one.",
  "thank you, i hope all goes well for you.",
  "i am sure you will be fine.",
  "i hear you on that. i have been laid off too. i was in a similar situation. i started looking online and found out that i could get a job there, but i had to apply for some other jobs. i ended up finding one in the local economy and was able to find a better job.",
  "bye",
  "i hope you get it!",
  "i've had a similar experience. i would say that you are more than capable of giving yourself another chance! i know it sounds like you have a lot of problems, but you can't help yourself!",
  "it is not as bad as it seems, but it is still a hard thing to overcome.",
  "i suggest you find a good exercise routine, and try to take care to not worry about getting sick, and then try to get out and enjoy your day.",
  "i would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions. i hope you have a wonderful christmas!",
  "i am glad i could help.",
  "ok, so you are not able to make plans with friends because they are not willing to come?",
  "i have been in a relationship for 4 years now. i have learned how to be happy.",
  "i know it'll be hard for a while but we can do it.",
  "what is your major?",
  "oh, well, i guess it's not as bad as it seems. have you considered reaching out to your friends?",
  "are you studying for the class and then you are struggling with your school?",
  "i understand completely. it sounds like you've been working in your life for a long time, so it'll be hard to keep up with the changes you'd like to see in your own life. i don't know how long you'll keep working, but i know that you'l find some new goals and goals that will help you find a better life.",

  "it sounds like you are trying hard and trying hard. what is your major?",
  "i am an english teacher.",
  "you too!",
  "it seems like it would be a lot easier if you could just tell them you're drinking more than you need to. you can just ask them to stop and not ask if they think you are doing anything wrong.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i know that you are not in a good place.",
  "you're welcome : )",
  "that is a very valid point. you are doing everything you can to get through this. you can overcome this.",

  "you have to have faith in yourself! i know that is very hard on people.",
  "do you live in a place where it'd be safe to live with her?",
  "i would be afraid to see him in a group therapy, it may be a good idea to get some counseling before you go.",
  "yes, i have done that. it'll definitely help you feel better.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. is there anything that is bothering you?",
  "i am sorry you are going through this, but don'; t give in to your emotions.",
  "have you thought about taking a break from school? i know it can definitely be a lot to take up time, and maybe you could look into getting a new hobby to get out of the house?",
  "have you tried to find a new group of friends who are more open to chatting?",
  "how are you today?",
  "i've been through a lot of tough times with my son and i'd suggest talking to him about what's going on. perhaps he may be able to find some support from his family. maybe even just a counsellor counselor or a therapist.",

  "i have had a few problems with alcohol, and a lot of times, i just want to relax, forget about it, and let go of the habit.",
  "i will be here for you.",
  "i think that if you have this discussion with your current boss, you might not be as nervous about it as you would be otherwise.",
  "i understand that you have issues with that. is there anything specific that you are trying to do for yourself?",
  "it seems that you are really struggling right now and i am so sorry that you have to go through this. is there anything that you can do to help yourself?",
  "i think we can do it!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. you are doing a great job. i know you're trying to find something that you enjoy, but there is still time to get through this.",
  "that is understandable. i am not sure what to say. i know that i have had a lot of problems with my parents when i was younger. i would say that try to try and communicate your feelings with them. it is very difficult to learn from someone who doesn't feel like we are doing anything right.",
  "what is going on?",
  "what are you worried about?",
  "i can see how that would be difficult.",
  "i've been through the same thing myself. it's tough, but you're not alone. i hope that you'll find someone who is willing to listen to you and will support you.",

  "i am glad you are feeling better.",
  "i am very grateful to hear you are doing well!",
  "i know that we're all in this together. but, i do feel that this is going to affect your life even more than it already has.",
  "have you considered talking to a professional?",
  "haha well i am glad i was able to help! i am sure you're not alone in feeling this way.",
  "what are you sad about?",
  "i understand. i went through that and it helped me. it'll take time to find out how to stop.",
  "yes, that would be really scary.",

  "i've been feeling sad as well.",
  "i understand that. i also really enjoy board games. i have tried to play games with some of them, but it is difficult.",

  "do you have any other hobbies that you enjoy doing?",
  "exactly! i've been in the situation where someone had their side of things and i was just as upset as them. i was able to move on from the situation. it'll be hard, but i'd say you'll have a better chance of getting over it.",
  "that sounds like a really good idea. i've always been more of a \" i like to have a good face \" type of person, but i do love to feel a bit more like i'd be able to share it with others.",
  "yes, that'd be hard to understand. maybe you should be more open to your husband's suggestions.",
  "you are very welcome. i am happy to help you.",
  "i can understand that. i think that you'll find a good person in a relationship. you could try to talk to someone that you can talk to about it and find out what you really need and how to deal with the situation.",
  "have you tried speaking to your boss about this issue?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. is there anything i can help you with today?",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "yes, i think you should tell him. he will appreciate the fact that you're making progress in your life.",
  "you have to be willing to learn. i know you have some experience, but you have no idea what you are doing. it is really hard to learn how to help others.",
  "i am so happy for you!",
  "i think that sounds like a great idea. it sounds like you are doing the best you can.",

  "i know you can do it!",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "yes, i believe that it is a wonderful thing to be able too help others.",
  "i understand that it can be hard to share with family. i've been there with my daughter and my husband. it'll be a lot of fun, especially since they are so close. do you think you would like to spend more time with your children?",
  "that sounds really hard on her, but i think she'll understand. i think if she'd rather you be around her then she'sn't being honest.",
  "oh no! that is horrible. what happened?",
  "what happened?",
  "what do you think might be the cause of your anxiety?",
  "i totally understand.",

  "i am glad i was able to give you a few ideas. i hope you do too.",
  "i have one son and he is a handful!",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. what are you going through?",
  "oh i understand that, i myself have felt like i was too late on plans and it can be hard to go back to normal.",
  "i would block him from your social media contacts.",
  "what happened?",
  "that sounds like a really hard situation.",
  "it sounds like you are trying very hard to get a job that will help you, especially if you are having a hard time finding one.",
  "i was in a relationship for a year and a half and the relationship went on for a month and a bit. it really helped to have some time to think about things like your future and work on yourself.",
  "it sounds like you are feeling very down, so you are trying to make yourself feel better about the loss.",
  "yes, it sounds weird, but maybe you can make the habit of making the same habit over and over again, and try to remember that you have to be motivated to accomplish it.",
  "yes, it was very difficult to publish. however, it's better now.",
  "hi, i am good.",
  "i'm sure that you will find some good work if you try.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, i can understand how difficult this time is. do your family have any support groups you could join to support you during this time? perhaps one of them could give you some support that you would like to share with your relatives or family members.",
  "that's really tough, and it must be hard to feel like that",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "it sounds like you have a lot of time to think ahead, and i think it would be a great idea to find a new job, even though you may not have the best financial situation right now.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "i hope that i can help, you are really helping.",

  "have you tried talking to your friends or family about this issue?",
  "i am sure it is. i am glad i could help!",
  "it sounds like you are both very concerned about the future and you are worried about her reaction. i think that is absolutely a valid situation.",
  "i have heard of some great charities, they offer counseling.",
  "i can see why that would be very rough. i think that you should try to take the survey and see if you are able to earn more money than you would be comfortable with.",
  "there are online groups that can provide you with a lot of information and support. i think that is a great start. it might also be a good idea to find a local gym that will be available for you to try out.",
  "hello, how are you doing?",
  "i hope that helped. have a great day!",
  "you can try to make sure they understand your concerns.",
  "i understand that. i used to be in the same situation. i was also in school and my friends were all there too. i just told myself i was going to do my homework and do my best. i got a tutor. i ended up doing better than i was expected. i realized that i had to do what was best for me.",
  "oh, i see. i am sorry to here that. i understand that your situation is very difficult.",
  "you have to try to do as much as you can, just remember to relax and do the best you can.",
  "i think it is important to be able to talk with your sister and tell her your feelings.",

  "you are welcome!",
  "i understand how you feel but it will get better",
  "you have the right to express yourself and be her friend, if you feel that she's doing that.",
  "it is great you are getting a lot out of this.",
  "i would also love to hear the music you love and be able to go back to a new experience.",
  "that'd be a great start, or even just talking to someone you trust.",
  "i think that is true.",
  "i can understand that. there are some jobs that have been announced in the past and some that are not at all promising.",
  "i can definitely see how stressing that could be. i can tell that you are feeling stressed. have you tried to explain to them why they are acting like this?",
  "i hope you get it!",
  "yes, that sounds like a great idea. and you can always use the free time to do anything else you like to do!",
  "have you thought about taking a few days off of work and going to your local college? it can be a good way to get away from the stress.",
  "i think that would be a good idea. there is no shame in seeking a solution to this situation.",
  "i'll tell you what helps me the most is getting out of my comfort zone. i spend most of my time thinking about the good times i have had and the bad times i haven't had.",
  "i've been through the same thing. it can be really tough. i believe that you're strong for being in such a good relationship. i know that feeling of unhappiness is very common and it's hard to change.",
  "are there any other friends you can talk to?",
  "i've had a similar experience when my father died and i know how difficult that can be. i think it would be best to speak to him and tell him that you have a good heart, and that you don't think he'll change his mind over something as simple as this.",
  "i am so sorry to here that, i know that feeling, i have had to go through similar things myself.",
  "what are some of the other resources you'd like to try?",
  "i think that is a great idea. it might help to start to be more comfortable with the idea of being in a group.",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. i think we can all try to find a good job.",
  "i think that'd be tough for you guys to deal with, i can understand how frustrating that is for you.",
  "it is not easy. but it is something we can work through.",
  "thank you! i hope you two can make it through this.",
  "i understand how it feels to feel that way, but i am sure you are feeling better now.",
  "it'll get better, but it'd be great to have someone to talk to.",
  "i understand that, i think it is great that you reached through the chat and talked to someone about this and they are happy to listen.",
  "i believe that you have a lot of options in your life. i believe in you and i wish you the best of luck!",

  "what's going on?",
  "so you are saying you are a woman, right?",
  "i was in the same situation. i had a long commute, and i felt like i was not getting to be able to relax and just felt like being alone.",

  "i am good. what are you doing today?",
  "i understand you are frustrated with the situation. i know that with my job i have to deal with it everyday. i think it is important to take care of yourself.",
