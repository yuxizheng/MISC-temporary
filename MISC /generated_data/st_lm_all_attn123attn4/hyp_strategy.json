  "i think you can ask your boss for advice if you want to do something else.",
  "do you feel that your work is stressful and you are trying to avoid it?",
  "you too!",
  "i think thats a problem. its a shame that you feel that way. they should know you need to be safe. if you do not, you are not worth the friendship. if i were you i would take the time to let them out and spend time with them. if it doesnt work, then i would tell them that you are more than happy to spend time alone. if this bothers you, i would let them be more than likely to invite you over. if that does not work, you may want to keep them away from them and that is a good thing. if your feelings are not hurt, it is a great idea.",

  "i wish you all the best and i hope you have a good rest of your day and stay safe!",
  "how are you?",
  "that's very frustrating. have there been any other counselling available for you?",
  "it sounds like you have been through a rough time and trying to figure out what you want most.",
  "there are also online support groups for people with mental health issues. it might help to talk to someone about this.",
  "i think that would be a good idea. and i think you should talk to him about how he is treating you.",
  "i understand that you are not confident in the situation, but it is important to try.",
  "how are you doing today?",

  "you too!",
  "yes, i think we can all agree : ).",
  "i think that would be a good idea.",
  "you could try searching for hits that you are looking for. they have a list of hits that will show how much money you make and how much of them are worth.",
  "that's really hard, i would try to make sure you can get some funds together to help her move and then see if you can find something else you can do",

  "you need to end the chat",
  "you too!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. is there anything that's bothering you about your exam?",
  "oh wow, that is a hard situation for sure.",
  "do you have any friends or family you can talk to about this?",
  "how can i help you today?",

  "that's so hard. have you talked to him about it?",

  "i think you should seek professional help as soon as you can.",
  "i am sure there are some churches that can provide extensions. you can always call the local churches and see what they have in place.",
  "have you tried talking to your partner about this?",

  "yes i am real person, how about you",
  "i can understand that. i've had to put down a lot of time for my business too. it has been a really tough year.",
  "i know it'll be hard, but i'd say that if you start doing it at home, you can take care of your children even if it takes time to do it, and then you can feel better about yourself.",
  "how are you?",
  "i am glad to help you. i wish you all the best.",

  "i do visit them often. i like to visit my professor too.",
  "do you think that you could get laid off if you feel you have already been given the benefits?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. is there something specific going on that is making you feel this way?",
  "so you are a strong person",
  "i can imagine that you feel that your whole family is in a really bad mood and you have no idea how to cope with them.",
  "you are welcome, if they were being unsympathetic they would have had a serious conversation with you and try to help you.",
  "that's good to hear! what sort of exams are you studying?",
  "i've done a bit of gossip myself and it's been helpful.",
  "i think it might be best to get some sort of counselling to see if he wants to talk. i think that is the best way to approach the situation.",
  "how long have you known the gf?",
  "you're welcome! i hope things work out for you.",
  "i've done that to so many times before. it can be frustrating but you can do it.",

  "if you've done the work, you'll be fine!",
  "do you feel that you should be able to make plans for other plans?",
  "if you ever need to talk to me again, i'm here for you!",
  "what is the reason for your sadness?",
  "i am in my freshman year. it is a very good option. networking is a good first step.",

  "i understand. it's hard to get a job when you have no formal training.",
  "i understand, but i think it will be better if we start looking for better work.",

  "i know how hard it is. i have also been through something similar. i had a partner leave me for someone else and i was really sorry.",
  "yes, it did. it really helped. it took some time, but it was a great thing.",

  "it sounds like they are being unrealistic in your position. have you tried talking to them about the situation?",
  "i see. so you feel as though you are being ignored by your own children?",
  "you are welcome!",
  "i am self aware. i have a list of things that i do every day that i want to do, and sometimes it helps to get rid of those things.",
  "i hope you have a great day.",
  "i hope that i have been able to have helped you today!",

  "i can understand how you feel. i have suffered from depression and it can be really hard to find a job.",
  "ah i see, i see. have you tried talking to them about this?",
  "what are you sad about?",
  "it sounds like you are trying hard to make yourself feel better. i have been there myself and it is important to know that you have tried.",
  "wow, that is very mean of you. i am sorry to hear that.",
  "i can understand how you feel, it must have been really hard for you to make that decision.",
  "i'd be happy to help you.",

  "hi there, how are you?",
  "i think that is a great idea! i would tell him that you are not interested in talking to him at all.",
  "i see. so you are worried about your job being underpaid and not being able to support people well. that is understandable. maybe you could find a mentor that might be able to give you advice on what things are in the area that you need to do.",
  "i'm really proud of you for doing that.",
  "i am glad i could help! i hope you have a great thanksgiving.",
  "is there anything else you would like to talk about?",
  "hi there, how are you doing?",
  "it sounds like you are really having a hard time.",
  "i would definitely put that in perspective if i were you.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "i think that is great that you are feeling better.",
  "i see. my daughter is four and we love spending time with her. do you think that you could spend some time with your kids and your husband during this time?",

  "it sounds like you are still a very strong person, but it sounds as though she is just not the right one for you.",
  "you can call her if you want, its just as easy as going to call her.",
  "yes, make it habit.",
  "it took me a while to get the hang of it but i think i was able to.",
  "what seems to be going on?",
  "well, it'd be good to take some time off and think of what might be a good gig to take on as well.",
  "i think it sounds to me like you have a lot in common with your family and you are seeking help from them. it seems as though you have been able to reach out for support on the internet. is that correct?",
  "i'm so sorry. that's a terrible situation. do you think you'll be able to find something to help you cope with this?",
  "hello! how are you?",
