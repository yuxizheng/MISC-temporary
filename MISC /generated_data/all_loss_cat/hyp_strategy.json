  "i can imagine that you are feeling a bit like this right now. i am sure you are ready to move on and have a great time!",
  "i am glad you are feeling better now. i think you will be fine.",

  "oh, i understand. i know how hard it is to get through a bad year. it's tough.",
  "so you are feeling down and depressed. what is it that you are worried about?",

  "i think it would be good for you to take some time to relax and have a good rest of your day.",
  "i'm happy to hear that you are doing well.",
  "thank you!",
  "hello! how are you?",
  "i think that's a very difficult thing to say. i think you should talk to a professional about it and let him know how you feel.",
  "i know i am. it has been so long since i have had a partner. i am still trying to find someone i can go out with and talk to. it'll take some time to build things back up, but once you find someone you can have a good time with, i think that you will be so much more relaxed.",
  "is there anything specific that is bothering you? do you have any particular reasons?",
  "what type of work are you looking for in a new job? it's a great opportunity to start a new career.",
  "oh, i've been there before.",
  "yes i can",
  "i am really sorry to hear that. i know that you can do it!",
  "i'm glad that you are able to talk about this. i know that you can be really positive and open up to people who are experiencing the same things as you.",
  "i think that would be a great place to start. i know it sounds weird but maybe you could try to get a support group together?",
  "i've tried to get out of my comfort zone and talk to people who i feel like i can relate to.",
  "i believe you can do it!",
  "i can understand that feeling. i was in a similar situation myself. i'm glad that you were able to talk to someone about it though.",
  "i believe it.",
  "you are very welcome! i hope you have been able to make it through this!",
  "it's great that you are willing to move on, but it'll take some time. take it slow, do your best, and find a way to move forward.",
  "i understand how you are feeling, i am sure you will be fine",
  "i understand how you feel. it can feel like your friends want you to be strong and to take care of them.",
  "i am sure that will help you feel a little better.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. is there anything else i can help you with today?",
  "i think that would be a good idea..",

  "i am sorry to hear that. would you like to talk about it?",
  "i understand. i have had a lot too. it's been difficult.",
  "it is a very difficult situation but i believe you will find a way through it!",
  "i am very sorry to hear that. i've been in a similar situation before, and it was a very painful experience. i had to go through a lot of retraining to get through it.",
  "i also love to read and write, i am not a writer though. i just do what i feel is best for me.",
  "are you able to go to the park or do you have a friend you could go with",
  "bye!",
  "that is a great idea, i think that you can study for exams in your free time.",
  "no problem! i hope that you feel better soon.",
  "i think that would be a good way to approach it.",
  "i hope you do get some good news and support from your loved ones!",

  "i would try to do what you love to do and have fun. that's what i do.",
  "yes, i can feel that. what is causing you to be depressed?",
  "i think you should try to find a new hobby that you like to do. i do have a few friends that i play with every now and again and they like to play with me and i do too.",
  "i'm glad that i could help you. i've been feeling a little bit lonely too.",
  "you as well!",
  "oh i am so sorry to hear that. my mother has died three times, but she's getting better. is there anything else i can do for you today?",
  "yes, it'll take some time to get used to. i'm sorry that you're going through that.",
  "i would try to get a tutor and see if they have some experience in this subject.",
  "that's great that you've found a way to help with your anxiety. i also think that if you try to get some meditation or reading done, you'll be able to find a way out of this anxiety.",
  "i'm glad i could help.",
  "i am doing well. what can i help you with today?",
  "i am doing well, thank you. i am glad you are doing well and i am sorry that you are having a hard time.",
  "i understand how you feel. it is hard when the situation is stressful. i have found that if i try to give myself time to think about things, i find myself getting more motivated to do something.",
  "you are very strong, and have a good heart, so i think you will be able to find a new job.",
  "i can understand how stressful that is, i have been there myself and have felt stressed about it as well.",
  "i understand that you are going through some hard times and i understand how you feel.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. do you have a specific reason why you are sad?",
  "i can definitely understand why you feel that way. i also felt the same way. it was very hard for me and my friends to come to terms with how we were feeling and how we felt.",
  "i understand that. i have had some pretty bad anxiety and depression. have you been able to see a professional?",
  "i would recommend you talk to a professional about this and see if they can help you get it under control.",
  "you are very welcome. i hope you feel better soon.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "of course, you can do it!",
  "that is a great idea! it's really hard to get into a friendship when you are trying to find people to share your feelings with.",
  "what happened?",
  "i'm here for you if you need anything else.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. how are you feeling today?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what happened?",

  "i can understand how stressful that would be. i would feel the same way as well.",
  "i would suggest getting some counselling. if you can afford it, i would recommend it.",

  "i hope you feel better soon. i know you can do this.",
  "goodbye",
  "i can understand how that would make you feel, i also had a friend who was like that.",

  "hello, how are you today?",
  "you're welcome. i hope that you have an amazing day and that you feel a bit better!",
  "maybe you could try to see if you can find some online therapy sessions that could help with your anxiety and anger.",
  "do you think you can talk to your school mates about this?",

  "i feel like i am a bit better at expressing myself.",

  "i can tell that you are a strong person. i am sure that you will find a great job soon!",
  "i have also struggled with depression. i know how frustrating it can feel. it seems like the only solution you can do is to just get out of the house and try to be with someone else.",
  "it sounds like you have a lot going on in your life and you are working hard to keep your mind off things.",
  "i see. do you have any friends you can talk to about it?",
  "well, if you are in the us, i would suggest looking into local government agencies and getting help from them.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "it sounds like you are worried that he might hurt himself or others by being in a relationship with someone who is not close to you.",
  "that is very understandable, i can understand how you feel. i have had similar experiences with people before.",
  "i understand that feeling.",
  "oh i see, so she is still there.",
  "you are so very welcome. i hope you get through this.",
  "i know you are feeling that way, but you can also try to find a new job if you are not sure you are in the best shape.",
  "if you are not comfortable talking to him about it, then you can try to talk to him privately about it and ask him about how he is feeling and why he is being angry.",
  "i think that is a good idea, i have found that even if it is overwhelming, it can be helpful to have some sort of support system in place. i would suggest that you try to talk to your friends and family and let them know how you feel about the situation.",
  "you too!",
  "i understand that, it is very difficult to make progress when you are trying so hard to get a job.",
  "i am good. how are you? what is bothering you? can you tell me a little more about it?",

  "i would try to make sure that you are able to find some sort of support from your local government or a professional",
  "thanks!",
  "i've tried to sleep better than when i was in the hospital. sometimes, the only thing that helps me is sleeping well enough to stay awake.",
  "you too!",

  "you're welcome.",
  "you've got this.",
  "have you considered getting some sort of therapy?",
  "i've seen the panda workers and they are not happy at all.",
  "it sounds as though you are being more than just yourself, which is good to hear.",
  "i understand how difficult it can be. i have been in a similar situation myself.",
  "it's definitely a good start.",
  "that is really hard to hear. is there any reason you feel that way?",
  "do you have a job in mind?",
  "i've been there before. i had to go through a lot of retraining and you know what you need to do to get through. i was able to get into a good college but it was very hard at first.",
  "i'm sorry you're having to deal with that. i've also felt the same way when my family members died, but i think they are getting better.",
  "you are very welcome, i hope you have a great day.",
  "are you feeling down at all?",
  "just be patient.",

  "i am sorry to hear that. is there a specific reason you feel that way?",
  "i have been in a few relationships, and i have found that some people are just not worth talking to about, but others are. you might want to consider doing that.",
  "do you have a job that you can work from home with?",
  "i know that it can be difficult when you have such a difficult time with school. it is really hard to see what is going on.",
  "have you spoken to her about it?",
  "i can understand how you feel.",
  "yes, i have been through a lot of that, especially the holidays. i was so happy to have been able to take care of myself in the past.",
  "i think you will do great! i think it will be hard to find another job, but you'll find something you love!",
  "i hope so, and i wish you all the best.",
  "i think that it'll be helpful to take some deep breaths and take deep breaths. if you have a lot of anxiety and worry about the future, you can always try to take a break for a few days.",
  "what happened?",
  "it sounds like you have had a rough year, and i know that you need to let him know how you feel.",
  "i'm doing well. how are things going with you?",
  "you should talk to her and tell her how you feel about this situation. she should know how you are feeling and not push you into another situation if it is not going to help you.",
  "i understand. i am not sure how to get you to the other end of the relationship.",
  "i understand. i think it's important to take care of yourself and your friends.",
  "have you tried talking to your professor about this issue?",
  "i am sure that will help with your anxiety.",
  "i know it's hard to let go of someone but i know you can do it!",
  "maybe you should ask her to give you a list of things she has done and then you could tell her what she has been doing and she will be able to tell you what she thinks.",
  "it'll take time but you can try to find a way to make a change.",
  "i'm doing ok. what's going on?",
  "i understand that. i've been there before. i had a friend who was diagnosed with cancer and he had to go to counseling. he was able to help me but it took a lot.",
  "that's a very difficult position to be in, but it's worth it in the long run.",
  "bye!",
  "yes, i believe it is. i also have been told that it is very important to have a good support system.",
  "i would suggest you try and think about some other things you are doing.",
  "you as well",
  "no problem! what's on your mind today?",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. have you been able to talk to him about this?",
  "it is good to talk to people about your feelings.",

  "you could always try a new job. have you thought about looking into gig work to help out with your job search?",
  "i understand how you feel. it is a hard time for everyone.",

  "i can understand that feeling of sadness. i also have had a similar situation.",

  "can you tell me a little more about it?",
  "i am well. how can i help you today?",
  "i'm glad i could help. i hope you have a great day!",
  "i understand. it's tough not to get your emotions out there when you're dealing with a situation like that. it must be very hard for you and your partner to be so honest with each other.",
  "hello, how are things going?",
  "i understand. have you tried to talk to your mom about this?",
  "yes. do you have any hobbies that you enjoy doing?",
  "you too... bye",

  "have you tried to talk him into it?",
  "i can understand how you feel. i've been in that position before.",
  "i'm here to listen. what are you doing?",
  "i know it'll take a while, but i know you can make it through this!",
  "what's your problem with the covid virus?",
  "i am good, how are things going?",
  "that sounds like a great idea!",
  "i've been there before... it's rough. i had a similar experience with my sister, she got a call from an agency that was looking for a job but couldn't find one and i was very nervous.",
  "hello how are you doing today?",
  "i'm glad to hear it!",
  "i think that would be a good idea. you are not alone in this!",

  "i think you need to take some time to relax and have a good time.",
  "i am sure you will find something",
  "it sounds like your husband is in a very rough place right now.",
  "i had a friend who was a alcoholic. she was very sad and i found out she was in a good relationship with another alcoholic.",
  "of course, i hope you feel better.",
  "that is a great idea. it may help to take some deep breaths and take some rest. it helps me to take a deep breath and get through my day.",

  "yes, it's hard to be so busy when things are so uncertain. i can tell you that the hardest part is getting your mind off of things.",
  "that's good that you're feeling positive now. i know it can be hard to see someone else being unhappy.",
  "that is a great idea. i hope you get to see your family.",
  "i have had similar feelings in the past. it can be hard to be alone in a new place.",
  "it's not just a matter of physical appearance, but also mental health. there are lots of other factors that could cause anxiety, like the pandemics, the pandelling, the covid. i know that if i were to start a new job, i'd be anxious too. but you are a person that can handle the challenges of losing a job.",
  "have you talked to anyone about this?",

  "you should be able to talk to your parents about it.",
  "i understand that. do you have anyone in your class who can help you with that?",
  "i know that sometimes covid can be a great way to get out of the pandemic. have you thought about doing that?",
  "i think you can start looking at things from a different perspective. you will find a way to get through this. i am sure that you will.",
  "what is the problem?",
  "you are welcome. i hope that you have a great day!",
  "i have found that even though i am a student, i tend to focus on myself and my grades.",
  "i hope you feel better!",
  "yes, i've found that having a mentor helps with the anxiety.",
  "yes, i think you can also ask the boss and see if they can help you with your resume.",
  "yes that sounds like a great idea.",
  "that's great! i'm sure you'll make a lot of money doing it!",
  "that is very good. i have never been to a vet but i do know that they will give you a medical note if you are not sure what to do.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "i'd definitely be interested in hearing your perspective on this.",
  "i suggest you try to look for a new job or find a new friend.",
  "you have been very lucky to find something in the pandemic.",
  "i have had to speak to my boss about this. he was very supportive and understanding.",
  "i am so sorry to here that you are feeling that way.",
  "you too, i am glad you are feeling better.",

  "i believe you can do it!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. would you like to tell me what's going on?",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "i understand that. i don't know what to say if it'll be okay to end things if it comes to it. it is not your place to say, you have to end it.",
  "hello how are you today?",
  "if you feel like you're not being given a chance to get the grade, then you might want to try to find a different major.",
  "that's a good point. sometimes the best way to distract yourself from things is to spend time outside and nature.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "i hope you have a good day!",
  "it's true. it'll take some time, but you'll find someone who will take care of you.",
  "i hope that this conversation has helped you to feel a little better.",
  "i know it's hard to see your partner in the situation but it'll pass.",
  "you are not alone, i have been in a similar situation and found that it helps me to take a deep breath and take deep breaths.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. how are you?",
  "you are welcome, i hope you will be able to find comfort in these tough times.",
  "i understand the pandemics are a real issue. i've been in that situation myself.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "that sounds like a very challenging situation to be in.",
  "you need to talk to your professors, they might be able to help you.",
  "i understand how frustrating that must be for you. have you been able to see your friend's ex boyfriend recently?",
  "yes, that is true. it is hard to get out of your comfort zone when you have no one to talk to.",
  "you are doing the right thing by trying to get over this situation.",
  "that sounds like a great idea!",
  "i am sure you are feeling very down about it and it seems like you are not feeling any good right now. is there anyone in your line of work that you could talk to?",
  "i am good, thanks for asking. what is your problem?",

  "it sounds like you're doing well with your work. i hope that he has a good time.",
  "oh wow! that is a lot of time and effort for such a small person. have you tried talking to him about it?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. would you like to talk about your situation?",
  "if you live alone, i think that might be a good place to start. you could try taking a walk or taking a deep breath and just getting yourself to sleep.",
  "i've been in a similar situation. i was trying to find a partner but the only thing that worked for me was to be open to talking to them.",
  "i think you should tell her that you are not sure if she is aware of her actions. she may want to make a decision based on your feelings and feelings.",
  "i would say if you don'thing she will listen, don'tact like she will. but you have a right to feel sad and upset.",
  "it might not be the best idea to be upset with her, but i am sure that if she has been there for you, you will be able to see her again",
  "of course!",
  "if you feel that you can make a new partner, you could try looking online and asking local governments.",
  "is there anything else that would be helpful for you?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i have a few friends who are in this state and they are very sad too.",
  "that's great that you have someone to talk to. i can understand your feelings.",
  "i'm sorry you have to deal with that. i hope you can find a way to work things through with her.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "i'll be okay. what can i help you with today? anything you want to talk about?",
  "you too!",
  "so you are feeling anxious about finals because of covid?",
  "i understand that you feel that you cannot trust her, but i would ask you to think about how you feel.",
  "you should not have to do that. it is your child's responsibility to keep her safe and healthy.",
  "that is a very difficult situation. i would suggest talking to your friend or family members about it.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. how can i help you?",
  "i can understand how you feel, i went through a similar situation a few months ago. it was hard at first but then i went to a therapist and found out that they were really helpful and could help me with my feelings and i was able to work through it.",
  "have you considered getting a dog or a cat? they can help you relax and help you to relax.",
  "have you talked to your boss about how you feel that way?",
  "it sounds like you have a good understanding of how to deal with them. perhaps you should think about talking to them again and telling them that you feel that you need to talk about this issue, and that you're trying to make a plan for it.",
  "i have been through a lot of difficult times, so i understand how you are feeling.",
  "i know that feeling. i think you are going to be a great person in the future.",
  "well, i would suggest you take a walk or bike or even jobbier.",
  "i'm sure there are other things you can do, but don't give up.",
  "maybe you can try to talk to him about how he is feeling and see if that helps.",
  "i can understand how that can be difficult. i'm sorry to hear you are going through that.",
  "i am good, thank you. what is the problem?",
  "do you have any hobbies that you enjoy?",
  "i'm glad i could help you. i hope you feel better soon.",

  "that's good that you are going through this and have someone to talk to.",
  "do you have a good support system with your boyfriend?",
  "sometimes it helps to talk to someone about it, or to take a deep breath and let it out.",
  "i am doing well thank you for asking",
  "it seems like you are struggling with your job market, is that correct?",
  "i am glad that you are feeling better. i know that you can try to be positive and optimistic. i believe that you will make a great mother.",
  "i would suggest trying to get your friends together and hang out with them.",
  "i would suggest taking some time to think about your options and your options. it may help to give yourself a chance to do something about your fear.",
  "you are a great person for being so open about it. i hope that you have a good day!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what's on your mind?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i have been in a similar situation before.",
  "it sounds like your boss is taking advantage of your lack of work.",
  "how can i help you today?",
  "you are most welcome! i hope things go well for you. i wish you all the best.",
  "have you spoken to your friend about it before?",
  "i can tell that you are very anxious and depressed.",
  "that is unfortunate. i know that it can be tough when you have to be so open to new ideas.",
  "it'd be better if you just talked to her and let her know you've been through this and that you are here to help her and you'd like to talk about things you'll never have had the chance to do.",
  "i've been through a lot of stuff in the past, but i do understand how stressful that can be.",
  "i know that you can do it!",
  "that is a good idea. i have found that if i try to focus on myself, i feel more relaxed.",
  "i understand. it is difficult for people to keep up with things that are going on, but you have to try hard to keep your head down.",
  "that is a good idea. i have been in a similar situation and it is very difficult. i know it can be hard but you are doing your best and i believe you will be able to do it.",
  "i am glad you are feeling better now. i think the pandemic has been very difficult for everyone and it's really hard to stay healthy during these times.",
  "it seems like you're having a rough time. what's bothering you? can you tell me more about it?",
  "you have to be strong and strong for this to work out. i know you are feeling sad because this is a big deal but you need to find the time to make the most of it",
  "i think you should talk to your parents about the situation and see if there are any support groups for you.",
  "i have done it before. i know it can be a bit overwhelming.",
  "i know that'll make you feel better, but you can'really make this work.",
  "do you have any other hobbies that you enjoy doing?",
  "yes, you are right, it is hard to see the good in someone you love.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "that sounds like a great idea!",
  "you are very welcome. have a great day and take care!",
  "you're welcome.",
  "how long ago did this happen?",
  "i understand. i have been in a similar situation where my parents were unable to help.",
  "i understand. the first step is to make sure that you are doing your best and don ; t let your anxiety get to you.",
  "ok",
  "i am sure that you are feeling a lot better now. it is really good that you have been able to talk to someone about this.",
  "that is so hard to do. i have had some of those issues myself and i can feel how difficult it is for everyone involved.",

  "you as well!",
  "take care and stay safe.",
  "i hope she will be able to talk to you and make you feel better.",
  "have you asked him to talk to you about it?",
  "how are you?",
  "oh i'm so sorry to hear that.",
  "i think it's important to take a step back and talk about this issue. it'll help you to have a conversation with him.",
  "i am glad i could help!",
  "i see. you're upset because you were cheated on?",
  "have you tried to talk to your parents about your feelings?",
  "i am sure you will be able to work through this. have you thought about reaching out to a professor?",
  "i am glad you were able to talk to me. i wish you all the best.",
  "no problem. i hope you are feeling better.",
  "i can tell that you are very concerned about your job prospects. it seems that you feel that you have a lot of time left. is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "it sounds like you are very intelligent, but you don't know what you are doing.",
  "have you tried getting her to talk to you about it?",
  "i'd recommend talking to your partner about this, and letting them know that you feel like this is something you can work through.",

  "can you tell me more about it?",

  "i am sorry to hear that. what is the problem?",
  "bye",

  "have you tried to find a job or a roommate or a family member to help you with your studies?",
  "it can be hard to talk to people about your situation when you are just talking to friends. sometimes it is best to let it go and get to know your friend and let him know you are feeling down.",

  "you might be able to connect with people via video call or text chat.",
  "that'll be hard. i would say try and make time for yourself. maybe make a plan for what to expect next?",
  "how long have you been apart?",
  "i am happy to help!",

  "i think that would be a great place to start, it sounds like you have some great hobbies going on.",
  "are you feeling anxious because of covid or are you just feeling stressed because of the pandemic?",

  "i think you should try to talk it through with your friends. try to get to know each other for awhile before moving on.",
  "i'm sorry to here that, but i know that it can be hard to talk to someone who doesn't understand you, especially someone who you know is your best friend.",

  "it may be helpful to take a deep breath and think about your feelings, and how you feel.",
  "i see. that is a very difficult situation to be in.",
  "you should have no problem reaching out to him again to see if he can help you find a new friend. if he says yes, then you could just let him be around you.",
  "thank you, it was very nice talking to you.",
  "i'm really glad that you are able to get some help from someone who is doing the same for you.",
  "i understand that feeling. i have been there myself.",

  "do you live with your husband and have family?",
  "it's a tough situation but you should keep trying!",
  "how can i help you today?",

  "you too.",
  "have you talked to your boss about how it's affecting your financial situation?",
  "do you have any friends that can help you through this?",
  "maybe you can try to talk to your family members and see how they are feeling",
  "oh, that sounds difficult. i know that there are a lot online courses, like i did, that i can recommend to you.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. you should definitely look into finding another job, it's a good opportunity to meet new people and learn new skills.",

  "bye!",

  "i know its hard but try to keep your head above the water and make sure that your grade is good and you don't let anything distract you.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what happened?",

  "it's not a matter of being sick or not, it'd just be a matter if you were sick or having an anxiety disorder.",
  "i've been in a similar situation. how long ago was this?",
  "i have been in that situation before. i found that trying to focus on my job helped me a lot. i used to focus more on myself and my work than my family though.",

  "how are you feeling?",
  "hi! how are you doing today?",
  "yes. i think you will be able to overcome this.",
  "i can understand how that can be difficult for you to handle. it's hard for me too. i think that it'd be best to just let things go. maybe you could try going on a walk or something to relax in the park or the beach or something, and take some time to get to know each other.",
  "i am so glad that you're able to talk to them. i know how hard it must be to be there for someone that doesn't understand you. do you have any family members you could talk to?",
  "you can try to chat with them and see what they think.",
  "it sounds like you are really wanting to find a job and maybe you can make a quick start.",
  "hello! how are you today?",
  "what do you mean by that?",
  "i can understand that. have you tried to talk to someone about this?",
  "hello. how are you?",
  "i know its hard but i believe you can do it.",
  "i understand your feelings. i am not the best, but that doesn't mean we can't be happy together.",
  "that'll be a very tough situation to be in.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, that must be very difficult.",
  "i've been there, it can be very isolating. do you have any support that can help you with your feelings?",
  "maybe you could try to make a list of things that you feel that you could do to make it easier on yourself.",
  "you can always go to the library and talk to your teachers, or just talk to the school counselor.",
  "i hope you feel better soon and it will help you to get out there and find a new job.",
  "thanks for sharing your feelings with me",
  "what is your major?",
  "i understand that. i have had a similar experience.",
  "you can try to keep yourself busy with other things in your life",
  "i can understand how you feel. i have been in a similar situation.",
  "what are you feeling right now?",
  "what would you like to know about the school?",
  "i have been in a similar situation, and i know that it can be hard at times.",
  "i think you should take a break from her, maybe you can talk to her again.",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. i'd feel the same way if i was you. it's hard to know what to expect from someone who has gone through something like that.",
  "i can tell you that i had a similar experience in the past, however, i started to meditate more and i started feeling better",
  "i think that the good news is that you have a lot of people looking for help.",
  "i am doing good. how are you?",
  "have you tried looking for another job? i have heard of a few places that offer jobs that are not related to the current position.",
  "i understand that. my dad died recently. it is so hard to see someone else go through a similar event.",
  "i have been in your shoes before, and it is not easy to get out of the house. it is a very difficult time.",
  "hi there! how are you?",
  "that's great! i'd love to help you with this.",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "it's always nice to find new friends. i have been in a similar situation and found that it really helped me to find a new job.",
  "he sounds like a really hard person to be around. have you tried talking to him about this?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. you seem like a very caring person.",
  "that's great! i'm glad you're feeling better.",
  "i can understand that. it seems like you're not happy with how she is acting. maybe she is not the right person for you.",
  "i know it can be a really hard time. you are going to do great!",
  "i have been in this position before, it's not easy but i try my best. i was lucky to have a job that allowed me to work remotely.",
  "i'm glad to hear that you're feeling better. i know it can be hard when the situation doesn't seem to be going your way.",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "you are welcome. i hope you have a great day and stay safe.",
  "you could call your friend and tell them you are feeling sad and they will talk to you",
  "i know that when i have a problem with myself, i tend to just take it out on myself and focus on what i'm doing.",
  "you have a lot of responsibility in finding a job. you have to take care of yourself first.",
  "i can tell you are very anxious about this situation and i know how you are feeling.",
  "do you feel that you are being treated badly by your parents?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what makes you feel stressed?",
  "you should try to make some time for yourself and your family.",
  "you too!",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. it is difficult to let go of someone who has been with you for so long.",
  "how long have you been friends with her?",
  "i am really glad to hear that! i am sure you will find some relief.",
  "yes, we all feel that way. it'll be okay!",
  "that sounds like a great idea. i'd suggest taking some time to yourself and then trying to think of something to do for yourself. maybe a walk in the park, or a walk outside with friends.",
  "maybe they are going to see you at the office",
  "are there any free places that you could check out online?",
  "you can call and ask them what their problem is.",
  "you are welcome! i wish you all the best!",
  "that sounds good!",
  "i understand, i have had similar experiences.",
  "it is never too late to get out of the relationship. i know it sounds like you have taken the best of the two of him. i think you should try to take care of yourself and your relationship and let it be over. it will be okay to break up with him but don't be afraid to ask him to take some time out of his life to figure out a better way to move forward.",
  "are there any other family members that you could reach out to?",
  "so you are feeling alone and lonely, which is understandable.",
  "that is a tough situation. how do you feel about your friend's actions and how are they affecting you?",
  "have you talked to him about his reasoning?",
  "do you have any other children in your family?",
  "you could try to talk with your professor and see how they can help you",
  "that sounds really helpful. i know you can get through this.",
  "i'm glad i could help you!",
  "i think you should talk to him about it.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what is going on?",
  "you are very welcome. i hope that i have been able to help you and that i can be of some help to you.",
  "i hope so too. i don't know if it is worth the trouble. i have to admit that i was surprised when i heard that i had two children in one house.",
  "i've had a lot of problems with my father and i'd say it's worth talking to him about it. sometimes you have to let go of a person's feelings. i think that you need to let things go and let them get to you. maybe you can talk to someone close to you and see if that can help.",
  "it sounds like you have been really trying hard to find the right solution. it sounds as though you are trying hard but you're not doing it right.",
  "it sounds like you have a plan. it will help you feel better.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that! how can i help you?",
  "i would suggest taking a couple of day walks or taking a few deep breaths and meditating. that will help you to feel better about yourself.",
  "that's very kind of you! i hope you find that he's just a friend who cares about you and not a real friend.",
  "i am glad to hear it. i wish you all the best with everything you are going through.",
  "that can be very stressful.",
  "i think you should talk to your boss about this",
  "is there any other way to help you feel better?",
  "that sounds like a great plan! i think that you should take one step at a time.",
  "you're welcome!",
  "i'd be willing to talk with a therapist. i think there are some that might be able too.",
  "have you considered looking into some sort of gig work? there are many people who are looking for a new gig, and they might be able to help you find something else.",
  "so you feel as though you don't want to be around her anymore?",
  "what is something that you think might help you with your anxiety?",
  "that's really good that you are talking to your husband about this. i am sure you will be able to make a great deal of money.",
  "have a great day!",
  "you're welcome! i've been here before and i'd like to help you if i can. i hope you have a great day!",
  "i know that i'm not the only one who has had a hard time dealing with my depression.",
  "how are you?",
  "i've been there before. it'll take some time but you can do it!",
  "have you thought about applying for unemployment? i've heard it's not cheap, but it sounds like it might be a good fit.",
  "i have also struggled with finding a job. i have been looking for one that pays well, but i am worried about how much the pay would be.",
  "it sounds like you're making a good choice in keeping yourself busy. you sound like a really good friend to be able to keep yourself busy while you've been trying to make your own life better.",
  "that'd be a great idea! i would also recommend seeing a counselor if you've ever thought about it.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i know it can be hard to work through something like that. is there anything particular that is causing you to feel this way?",
  "have you tried to find a job online?",
  "i understand how you are feeling.",
  "that'd be really stressful, i'm sorry. it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress right now, i hope things get better for you!",
  "i understand. i have had my share of breakups in the past. sometimes it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.",
  "it sounds like you are feeling sad for your son and that you are not sure what to do about it. is that correct?",
  "what has been going on?",
  "i can relate to that. it's been rough for me too.",
  "it'll be okay! you're doing the right thing! i'd recommend seeking out local job groups or even finding online employment that you can work with.",
  "have you talked to your professor about this?",
  "that's what i think is the best thing to do. keep your head up and keep working hard on your studies.",
  "are you able to talk to your boss about the issue and explain your concerns?",
  "well i think that would be good. i would look into other things that could help you feel less alone. perhaps even taking some time to talk to a therapist could help.",
  "i hope i have been able to help you today!",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "i've been there. i was so upset when my father died. it'd been such a terrible year for him.",
  "i understand that you feel like you have a lot of problems. i am sorry that you are having issues with your son.",
  "i understand. it is hard when someone you care about is in a tough spot. i am sorry you are in a similar place.",
  "i can understand how you feel. i know that it took me awhile to get over the loss of my husband.",
  "that's a very long time to be in a relationship. that'll be hard. i know how hard it can be to break up with someone who isn't your best friend.",
  "that sounds really hard, i'm sorry to hear that. i know that this can be hard to deal with at times.",
  "i am sure you will find a new job soon. it is hard to find work when you are still young. i am sorry you have to go through this.",
  "why do you feel that way?",
  "i think you should talk to your doctor about it.",
  "please do not worry",
  "you are welcome. i hope you can get through this and be able to find a better job.",
  "i can understand that. i have been in that situation and felt so guilty for it.",
  "you are very welcome, bye",
  "i see. well, do you think you can get her to come out from behind you and tell her that you're not listening?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, i understand how you feel.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what is causing you to feel this way?",
  "it was nice talking to you. i hope you can get through this.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "i am doing okay. how long have you been together?",
  "i can understand why you are upset. it's a hard time for a lot of people.",
  "i understand that you feel upset and unsure but you can try to talk to your manager about what's going on with your coworkers and see how they respond.",
  "it sounds like you have a lot going on in your life, and i'm proud of you for reaching out. i know you're doing great!",
  "i understand that. do you have a close friend that you can talk to about this?",
  "i hope so. that is the most positive thing about this pandemic. i wish you all the best in the future.",
  "what kind of work do you do?",
  "i understand. i had to quit my job and move out of my moms house.",
  "i'm glad i could help you today!",
  "i'm glad to hear that.",
  "i see, i am sorry to hear that. i've been in the same situation before. i was in a similar position. i went to the grocery store and looked for a job but they wanted me to make a list of jobs that i wanted and then i applied for a new one. i ended up applying for the one that was better and was accepted.",
  "i can definitely relate to that. i have found a lot of things to keep me motivated during the day.",
  "i can understand that, i am a teacher myself. i know how stressful it can be.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i know how difficult it is to be a part of a company.",
  "is there anything else you would like to talk about?",
  "i think that would be a good start. i think you could try yoga, it would help you focus on your appearance.",
  "have you tried reaching out to your manager to see if you can talk to them about your concerns? i have heard of many times where the manager is just really concerned with how the employees are feeling.",
  "i hope you are feeling better soon. i am glad you are getting some help.",
  "are you having any other issues with your job?",
  "are you having any other friends or family to talk to about it?",
  "hello, how are you doing?",
  "what's making you anxious about your job search?",
  "i'm sorry you've been in a tough spot.",
  "that's not good. is there something specific going on with you that makes you feel stressed?",
  "bye",
  "i hope i have been able to help you with anything.",
  "i think you should try it and see how it goes. i think it will be a great place to start!",
  "hi! i am here to listen and help you today.",
  "that's pretty awful. i'm sorry.",
  "i can relate to that feeling. it can be very difficult. i would be very happy to help you!",
  "i know, i'm so sorry. i've been there too. it's awful. i wish you all the best in the future. i know you can do it!",
  "yes, and it is also important to remember that the world is not a perfect place. you need to look out for yourself.",
  "maybe try to have a conversation about this with him. he might not want to see you if you are a man",
  "i would try to talk to your boss and let him know that you feel that he has done a bad job.",
  "i know it is hard to find friends these days, but you can always take the time to connect with your family and friends in order to keep in touch.",
  "i'm doing well thank you. is there something specific that is bothering you? i can tell you a bit more about it.",

  "have you spoken to him about this issue?",

  "i understand. you are very strong for taking care of yourself and your mental health.",
  "have you tried any other online dating sites?",
  "you too!",
  "that is really tough. i'm sorry to hear that. i know that when i was in the same situation, i had to make sure i was safe.",
  "why did they break up?",
  "it's not a good habit to have. i think you should try and take a step back and reflect on what you've done to be able to feel better.",
  "i know it'll be difficult, but you've got to try to stay healthy, you know?",
  "it seems like you are having some issues with your job right now.",
  "yes, that is what i do.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. it sounds like you're having a hard time finding your family members. do you have any friends or family you can share with?",
  "oh i am so sorry to hear that. how long have you been struggling?",
  "are you at least getting some exercise?",
  "maybe you can talk to her and tell her how you feel.",
  "i think it's great that you're still friends and that you want to get away from your friends. i think you should try to keep an open mind.",
  "i know it'll be hard, but it'd be worth it to have the extra time to learn how to be more productive and healthier.",
  "you said that he didn't say anything?",
  "i understand that it is difficult to be so dependent on someone who is not your loved ones, but i think that you should try to talk about your feelings and your feelings.",
  "i think that would be helpful to have something to keep you occupied.",
  "so you are saying that you are in a situation where you feel you are not worthy to be loved?",
  "i would suggest talking to your boss and letting him know that you're not sure if he's being honest with you.",
  "i can understand how that can be difficult.",
  "it's good to have someone who you can talk to and understand.",
  "i understand that. you can try to talk to your family about it.",
  "i am glad that you are feeling better! i wish you all the best in your future endeavors.",

  "you can always do it!",
  "i am sorry to hear that... what is the problem?",
  "have you considered seeking therapy? it'll help you feel more connected to your parents and make you feel better.",
  "i've found that when i try to find something new, i always end up ending up in the same place as i was the last time. sometimes it takes a little while, but i'm glad that i found something new.",
  "maybe it's worth looking into in the short term, perhaps you can get a list of possible ways to get your kids to bed, or at least get some sleep to help them sleep.",
  "i understand that. i would not worry too much about it though, as long as you are doing the same things you are supposed to be doing, it will work out.",
