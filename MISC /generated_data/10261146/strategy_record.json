  "that's great. i hope you have a good day!",
  "i do know it can be really hard to deal with. but i think it's worth it.",
  "you can do it!",
  "you're welcome. bye.",
  "i think it might be worth trying to talk to a professional, if they could help you.",
  "that's great! i know how much you care about your work and that you are doing the best you can!",
  "i know you have to be careful about what you say because you may be doing this to your best friends and not your best, but you can also try to talk to your ex about the situation and see what he thinks and maybe he has a point in life where he has no idea what you are doing.",
  "i hope you have a good evening and i know you can get through this.",
  "i am stressed out because of the pandemic, but i am trying to focus on myself and my family",
  "i love my job. i worked at a grocery store for about a year and the quality was fantastic.",
  "anytime, i hope you are feeling better.",
  "i can understand why you're feeling that way.",
  "i can tell that you are stressed and anxious about this situation because of your own feelings.",

  "i am glad you are feeling relieved and relieved about her settling in.",
  "i think you should give it a try.",
  "i know it'll be tough, but you are able to make some time to yourself.",
  "it'll be nice to have someone to share your feelings with.",
  "do you like it?",
  "you as well!",
  "okay, so you want to say that he is taking a break for a little while.",
  "i think that is a good idea. i think if you start to talk to them and explain your feelings, you can get them to open up to you.",
  "that sounds like a good plan. i think you guys should talk to him about the reason for your desire to cheat.",
  "i've also been in this situation, and i know how hard it is. but it sounds as if you have an idea of what you want to do, and you'll start with a good start.",
  "have you thought about talking to a doctor about the situation?",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. that must have been a very difficult time. have you considered talking to him about your feelings?",
  "i think that would be a good idea. i think it'd be great for your children to have that support in case of a divorce.",

  "you can do it.",
  "you sound like a very caring person and i hope that you will be able to find some support in time.",
  "do you have any hobbies?",
  "i completely understand. the fact that you are working until 1212 makes me think that you might be feeling down right now.",
  "you are right. you should tell your friend what you are doing. i don't know what they will say if you do that.",
  "i understand. it is difficult to find time to complete things when you feel like you have so little time.",
  "you've got this!",
  "yes, online shopping is the way to go! i think that if the economy improves, things will be much better.",
  "no problem. take care and take care!",
  "i understand your concern, but i think you should try and work out some ways to tackle the issue with your friends. i would recommend a movie or a tv show.",
  "have you considered going outside and exercising?",
  "i am sure your academic will be better with time",
  "i am glad i could be of some help.",
  "i also have been through this and it has helped me a lot",
  "it sounds like you've already talked to a close friend of mine. i've had this happen to me before and it helped!",
  "it seems like people are also worried about their safety during these times, though. they might not even realise that the people who are wearing them are wearing masks for protection.",
  "you could also try contacting unemployment. com and asking if they can give some suggestions to help.",
  "you've got this!",
  "i think it'd be great for you to try to get some closure on your feelings. you have every right to be upset, especially with your own friendship.",
  "i do understand that you have been there before and i know you will be fine.",

  "do you think that maybe you could seek out a group that would be able to connect with you more?",
  "that'll do it! i think you will do great!",
  "i think that you should give her some time to reflect on things and let her know how you feel.",
  "have you thought about joining an online group to meet people?",
  "i understand that. i also think you are a toxic person who will use this opportunity to hurt you. i know it is difficult to deal with, but i know you can overcome this.",
  "oh i love to cook and spend my time with family and spouse too",
  "meditation has been proven to help calm and calm people.. and you know, it does not hurt to try.. i hope you have a good christmas!",
  "it would be good to talk to someone about this.",
  "bye!",
  "you think it is because of your friends?",
  "i understand that you feel that you are not in control of your life anymore. i would also consider reaching out to your friends or family to see if you can speak to someone about this.",
  "i'm glad i could be a support to you.",
  "you are a great employee!",

  "you are welcome. i hope you feel a little better now.",
  "bye",
  "no problem, i hope you have a good day and good luck!",
  "yes, i have had a similar situation with a close family member. the best thing i did was to let them know that i was not going to risk their lives for them and that i wasn't going to hurt them or affect their lives at all. it did not help that they are not my friends anymore. i didn't want to ruin the friendship.",
  "that's a very positive thing to say!",
  "you're very welcome. i am so glad i could help.",
  "i think it'd be good for you to get some perspective on it.",
  "have a great day!",
  "you've been with your partner for years now and he still loves you",
  "i think if they just want to get by and have a good day, then it would be okay to talk. if they are just getting by, then they should be doing something about it.",
  "it sounds like your friendship is very toxic and unhealthy.",
  "i think she might have some issues and it may be worth trying to talk to them about them.",
  "i have, and it was really helpful. i found that even getting out of bed helped me.",
  "yes, that'll be great.",
  "you are welcome. i hope i have been able to help you today.",
  "i know how hard that must be, but i know you can get through it.",
  "no i don ; t think so. i've been in a long term relationship and the only way i can get over the loss of my wife is to just take it one day at a time. i know you are not doing this to hurt doug and you are doing this because you want him to feel better. i think you need to take a step back and take a deep breath and think about your own happiness.",
  "merry christmas to you as well",
  "have you considered any other hobbies?",
  "yes, i do enjoy my current field. i also enjoy my job.",
  "i think that would be a great idea. i know i could see how anxious you must be about the situation as well.",
  "you are welcome! bye!",
  "no problem.",
  "i understand that. do you have any family or friends who you could reach out to to?",
  "i also have a credit card with a high balance, and it helps me to pay things off when they come off.",
  "so you think you are doing the best you can and you think that your friendship is genuine.",
  "it is ok if your girlfriend is not the same as yours.",
  "no problem. have a great day!",
  "well, you said that you have been engaged for almost 3 years. is that true?",
  "that is a good idea!",
  "i understand the anxiety. the pandemic was the first wave of the year and there was a wave of fear going on.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, is she close with you? i am sure she has had a rough year.",
  "that's pretty good! i know it's tough, but you can't do it without her.",
  "that's understandable, sometimes sleeping issues are a result of stress and anxiety.",
  "i understand that feeling. i have had to use a virtual email to access mine",
  "perhaps you could start to talk about your feelings and why they are getting so hard on you.",
  "you'll be ok!",
  "that's a shame, do they think they have more of an effect on you?",
  "what do you think you can do to cope with this situation?",
  "i am glad you have found something that you enjoy and that you have a plan to get through this.",
  "it is a difficult situation, but i think you can do it!",
  "what type of work did you do in college?",
  "do you think that you could talk to them about the issue?",
  "do you think you could try to go to a meeting?",
  "you are very welcome, i hope you have a good day and take care of yourself and your family!",
  "i feel the same way, but i think it will help.",
  "i think you should try and make a list of things that you do for her and maybe even put her name on it.",
  "i know you will get through this! i know i did.",
  "yes. family is the key to happiness. you deserve someone who cares and is open to trying new things.",

  "i think you should be able to get a small amount of gift cards for a couple of weeks each year.",
  "ah yes, the south. the northern part of the country, but not the southern part of canada. you mentioned you are in the east coast of the us",
  "i understand that it is a very stressful time to be having to go outside but i think you will be able to see the bright side and feel better soon",
  "it sounds like you have been with her for awhile, so i'm sure she doesn't want to talk again.",
  "you are very welcome. have an awesome day as well!",
  "good to hear!",
  "yes i think you should tell them and i think they will understand the consequences",

  "do you think you would be surprised if you can find a better partner to take care of you now?",
  "have you ever tried to play a game that you enjoy?",
  "i understand your concern but as long as you are mature and know what you should be doing, you can do it",
  "i understand, i have had to take out my friends by not inviting them to my club. i usually feel the same way when i don't want to risk inviting someone.",
  "have you tried to talk to your supervisor about the situation?",
  "you are welcome! i hope the best of luck to you.",
  "i can see why that would make you angry.",
  "i feel your pain, it feels like we have to go out of our way to get a job or something.",
  "thanks for talking!",
  "i can understand the anxiety. i myself have done this in the shower before. it's really easy to forget your steps.",
  "yes, and we're going to have to take the risk of being stuck in a new position for awhile before we even consider looking at moving up.",
  "i think that is a great idea.",
  "that sounds like a good time to try anything.",
  "you too!",
  "i think it is a great idea to reach out and ask for suggestions.",
  "i can imagine how upset that would make you feeling.",
  "i have been to greece a couple of times and i loved it, i was just there for a week. i think it was beautiful there, but i think there are other people in greece too.",
  "it sounds like she might not want you being honest with her. it sounds as though it might be a good idea to try and talk to her about it. it would be hard to know who you are talking to and whether they believe you or not.",
  "that'll be a tough situation to be in, but it's worth a try.",
  "i know it'll be hard to get to work on time but i'm sure that you will be able to make it through this!",

  "have you tried reaching out online to people who might be able to help you?",
  "that is really hard.",
  "i know it can be difficult, but you can do it!",
  "you too",
  "is there anything else that i can help you with today?",
  "i have had to go through the same thing. it was very difficult for me. i would just sit down and have a serious talk with them and explain to them why you feel that way.",

  "no problem! i hope i could give you some ideas. i know you can do it!",
  "if he is going to take advantage of you, then it may be best to ask him why he is acting this way. perhaps he is feeling jealous because of your hours?",
  "maybe you should talk to your family about the situation with her and see if they would be willing to give a little more attention to the issue.",
  "yes, it is very frustrating, i know that this has been going on for a long time and the only way to get over it is by staying with your roommate.",
  "you can also try a walk in the park to clear your mind",
  "that is a very mature thing to say. it sounds like you are making a good decision.",
  "i understand that your husband is not the one that needs to be controlled by you. i understand your feelings and i know how hard it is to be in a situation like this.",

  "i like to play video games that really make me feel like i'm doing something right, like doing something that makes me feel good.",
  "oh wow that is a good idea. do you think you could spend time away from him?",
  "what do your family do for work?",
  "it's great that you're starting to recognize that you are doing your best and are doing everything you can to make yourself a better person.",
  "i wish you all the best!",
  "it is a good thing that we are still trying to figure out the right path to take.",
  "you are welcome, i hope you feel better soon!",
  "it sounds like you are feeling a lot of pressure to be around people you don't know. it seems like you have a lot going on in your life right now.",
  "good day to you as well",
  "have you tried to meet new people?",
  "i can see that being a problem.",
  "i know it can be hard to get it cut, but i know that if you keep going, you will eventually get through this!",
  "that is a good idea, maybe you could look into trying some new activities that will help you with your mental health",
  "i can understand that you are feeling a bit overwhelmed and overwhelmed. i think you have the right idea though.",
  "you're doing your best!",
  "well you should be able to speak to your friend and ask her if she would like to chat",
  "it sounds like you have a lot of worry about not doing something you enjoy. do you have friends or family who can help you with that?",
  "that's good! i hope you will be able to recover it soon.",
  "i can tell from this that you are very upset and sad.",
  "have you considered reaching out to any of them if you feel you are not able to get along with them?",
  "i understand that. sometimes when i have a hard time with my health, i take it slow and i have to take a few deep breaths to relax. i try to take my mind off of it and focus on what i need to do to cope.",
  "if it comes to that, then you should take action to avoid the responsibility.",
  "i can see how that would be very stressful.",
  "i can understand that, i have had to deal with that myself. i believe that it is a difficult time to be in that position. it is definitely better to talk to a professional though.",
  "it'll definitely help.",
  "you've already done the best you can to do the best for you.",
  "that's amazing!",
  "it sounds like you are in a good relationship, but i think it is important to be careful.",
  "you're very welcome. it's good that you are able to have someone to talk to. i know you are doing everything you can to help and have someone else be there for you.",

  "do you have anyone who could help you?",
  "i know you can do it. if you keep trying and keep trying, you will get through this!",
  "you are very welcome. have a great day and good luck.",
  "when i feel stressed i like going out for a walk. it relaxes me.",
  "you are welcome.",
  "it's always good to have a friend who can lend a hand.",
  "you are welcome! take care of yourself.",
  "i think you should give them a little time and let them know how you feel. i've had a similar experience myself. i know that it'll be hard, but you've already been through it and it will get better.",
  "it'd be a very toxic situation to be in, and you deserve better than that.",
  "i hope you feel better soon!",
  "i know it's hard to find a job these days but i think it would be good for you to try.",
  "that's what i believe in. it's a very difficult time but i think you will be able too.",

  "i know you can do it, i believe in you.",
  "i can understand your feelings. i also took geology classes for my major and it was very similar to geology and it's not the same as geology.",
  "i understand how your children are feeling. having children is tough and dealing to kids at the exact same time, so it sounds like you are a caring person.",
  "i believe that you will overcome this fear and you can get through this.",
  "i think you should be proud of your abilities and dedication to your craft, but you need to be prepared for the worst",
  "maybe you could write a short story about what happened with you and your family and how you are feeling",
  "you too!",
  "that's scary, but it's also worth looking into. it'll be okay.",
  "wow that'd be a yikes. have you considered talking to your boss about how you're feeling about this?",
  "it would definitely help me to start looking at the resume and see if there are any other ways to approach the situation that i might be able to help you.",
  "i see.. so you are saying you are afraid of the unknown.. that is an interesting way of looking at it",
  "oh dear. how long have you been friends?",
  "it sounds as though you have been missing your family and friends for a long time, is that correct? or has this been a recent change?",
  "i think if you plan it, you can spend time with your friends too and do a walk around the park",
  "i understand, i had a similar experience about 2 years ago. i've also been feeling a bit overwhelmed and overwhelmed with my life.",
  "yes, i understand. have a wonderful christmas to!",
  "i understand. i have to go now and try to talk to you again.",
  "i think you should think about what your options are and try to look them in the best way possible. you can't just walk into the park and have a movie and book club. it would not be the most fun, but it would be good for you.",
  "maybe you could consider moving to a new state and see if they'd be willing to take a visit.",
  "that sounds like a good plan!",
  "bye.",
  "i can see that you have done alot of things.",

  "that is great!",
  "you too",
  "it was my pleasure, i hope you feel better soon!",

  "i'm sure you have done great things for your family and your children.",
  "yes of course, it is my pleasure.",
  "you are doing great!",
  "yes. just think of the good things in the world.",
  "that's very true, i would not want to lose my job or life just yet.",
  "have you thought about trying to visit your family during the holidays?",
  "what about taking a walk?",
  "i think it's a good decision. i have a feeling that you guys will have to sit down and have a serious conversation about it, and at least at a point when the friendship is resolved, it will be more than just a joke and a two words explanation.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i hope you are feeling a bit better now.",
  "i hope you can get through this!",
  "no problem, i hope i was able to be of some help!",
  "is there anyone else you know that you could talk to?",
  "revenge is the best way to solve the problem.",
  "i'll pray for you. i can tell you've had a lot of hard time, and you'll get through this. but i'd highly recommend taking a few deep breaths and getting away from the house. it'll help you.",
  "yes. you will be fine.",
  "if i may ask, what country are you from?",
  "why did you feel like you were being attacked?",
  "i've been there and it'll all work out in the end. it takes some time but you will get through it.",
  "i think that there is a great opportunity for you to make a suggestion to move forward and move forward. you deserve to feel the steps in the right direction and to move on.",
  "oh so that was the movie about a cat that had died of a heart attack?",
  "your welcome!",
  "i think it will be good to get out there and explore other options.",
  "yes, i think so.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i can tell you are feeling down.",
  "i am glad to hear it.",
  "wow that is quite a while",
  "that's a good idea. you can try to find some online resources to help with your depression.",
  "have you thought about moving there? maybe you could move in with her and get a better job?",
  "it is great that you are taking the time to try to get to know people through the internet.",
  "it is okay to be low",
  "it sounds like she has been acting like this for a long time.",
  "you seem to have a plan. it sounds like you have a good handle on this.",
  "is there a way you could take some time away from the work? i am not sure i know how to make a list of things to do.",
  "you are absolutely right, especially when it comes to health care. but we are not just talking about money right now, even though we have had to give it away several times, you can't deny it.",
  "i hope you feel better now.",
  "i can imagine how difficult that must be.",
  "i'm glad you are feeling better. i know it can be very difficult to feel like you are getting it pretty well.",
  "bye!",
  "is there any way you can reconnect with your cousin now? i know it's hard but i think it could be a good opportunity to get back together again.",
  "fre is the second most common word for relationship",
  "you are welcome, it's been a pleasure speaking with you!",
  "no but i do have a daughter.. she is in school now and she is out of school for 2 months and still learning and learning and i feel bad about it.",
  "i understand that it is hard to get to sleep when you are tired and tired all the time.",
  "you are very welcome.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. have you been able to talk to anyone about this situation?",
  "you're welcome. i hope you feel better soon.",
  "that's completely understandable. it seems to me that it'd be hard to leave a job that you've been wanting to do for years, when you are trying to get back into the business of keeping yourself busy, and even if you don'tt have time to do anything right now, you should consider moving on.",
  "good luck",
  "you are welcome.",
  "that's horrible, it sounds like you're really struggling and it's hard to get through someone who does not know how to act.",
  "if you look online, there are a lot of good options",
  "that is a long time. do you have anyone you can talk to about it and maybe a therapist?",
  "oh wow that is a big deal. i can completely understand how anxious you are.",
  "it is okay to be upset with someone, but the fact that he is also your first love of your life is an indication that you deserve someone who loves you.",
  "i understand, it is a difficult situation. it must be hard to get through it.",
  "thanks and you too!",

  "it sounds like you are having a hard time communicating your feelings.",
  "sorry to here that. losing a pet is very tough. i've had a lot of pet deaths and i know how hard it is to lose one. i don't know if you would be able to live with one.",

  "i understand.",
  "you're very welcome.",
  "i hope i have been able to help you",
  "you too!",
  "i would suggest finding a way to cope with the situation as it is going on now and there are lots of ways to deal with it. you could also try looking into some other ways to work through the feelings of depression.",
  "it sounds like you both are feeling down and are feeling lonely. i know it sounds silly, but maybe you should try to tell her how you feel and see if there is something you can do to help her.",
  "i've always felt better after talking with you and feeling better about things. thank you.",
  "i'm glad i could be here.",
  "it can take awhile but i have found that if you focus on one area at a time, things will eventually get better. just keep trying and keep trying.",

  "that's so good! i love fish!",
  "i am so sorry you had to go through that. it sounds like you really did take the effort to get those papers back.",
  "i can understand that, i had a similar situation and it did not help my friendship at all.",
  "do you like your job?",
  "i understand that you are having a hard time, but you need to take care of yourself first and foremost.",
