  "you should tell him that you don't want to make any more friends",
  "that is the best way to start. it can be a good start, but if you focus on making yourself happy, you can make yourself happy.",
  "i had this happen to me before too. i would have been upset, but then i would think about how much better things would have be.",
  "that sounds like a great idea. i've never tried it before, but it sounds like it might be a good way to help pay off some of your bills.",
  "you are very wise!",
  "i've been through a similar situation before. i'm so sorry. i can tell you're in a very difficult situation, i can't even imagine how you'd be able to handle it. i know you've made it through it, but you'll need to be firm with him.",

  "i know you are trying to do your best but i think you should take some deep breaths and let your heart take a break from you.",
  "you can try to do that with your family and friends. i think you will have a lot of fun.",
  "i also try to get out of the house and spend time outside.",
  "great! you are doing great! i am glad i could help.",
  "thank you. i think that is a wonderful idea. i wish you all the best.",
  "you'll have a great christmas!",
  "i would say just take a deep breath and take some deep breaths. it will heal.",
  "i understand. i lost my dad in a similar situation and it made me feel very down.",

  "have you tried to talk to them about this?",
  "i am so sorry that you are going through this.",
  "i have had my fair share of problems and have dealt with them, i can tell you that it is hard when people do not see you in the best light.",
  "i know!!! i don't know what to tell you. i've been there and it'll be okay. i had my first time with a client who was working from home. i found that i had to find a new job, start over, then move on. it really made me feel a lot better about my life.",
  "i think that you are doing the right thing.",
  "that is a tough situation to be in, i think that the hardest part is finding a job you are happy with.",

  "i would suggest looking into a counselling if you are interested in that. they are very professional.",
  "i think it'll be worth it to make sure that you have a good idea of what you'll need to present before the presentation.",

  "that's great! you have an amazing head on your shoulders, and you can be sure that you will be able to help them through this.",
  "do you have any family members you can talk to about this?",
  "i can relate. the covid is tough, but i have been there, but it's a really good way to get through it.",
  "of course! i hope you feel better soon!",
  "that's a good idea. you should not take that risk.",

  "i think you are right, it might be a little much to talk to her about it.",
  "you're welcome!",
  "that makes sense. it sounds like your professor is failing you, so it'll be hard to feel comfortable with that.",
  "i think that you should wear a mask and wear it. i know that is very difficult to do but maybe it would help.",

  "i would recommend you to join a local group that you can talk to about how you are feeling.",
  "do you think that your husband would be willing to spend some time with you?",

  "you're very welcome!",

  "have a lovely rest of ur day! i've been feeling down about my job situation as well.",
  "i think it might be time to try to get to know each other and see if there are any other people who can help you with this situation.",

  "i'll suggest you start with one of the 21 21 books. it can give you some more space to do things you enjoy",
  "you sound like a good person and you deserve to be happy with the dog. maybe you should try to see if you can find a new job or find another job that will provide a better experience for you.",
  "you're very welcome.",
  "yes, i was stressed out, but i think i was able to do my best.",
  "i've found that when i'd be feeling down, i would try to make an effort to think of what i'll be doing when i feel down.",
  "you are very welcome. i hope you can find a solution soon!",
  "that'd be a really hard time to deal w.",
  "it's really good that you are doing this! i am sure you will be able to pay them off in a few years.",

  "i hope i could help you through this. you will get through this, it is never too late.",
  "you are very welcome. i wish you the best of luck.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i know you will be able to find another job",
  "yes i know that is tough but i think you will do great",
  "bye, too.",
  "do you think that they would be able to tell you why they're making fun of you?",
  "i've had my fair share of fights with my family before, and i am not surprised that you are afraid of that.",
  "wow, that's crazy, i have been with my friends for 10 years and they are still fighting over this.",
  "i think you will be surprised at how much people have learned from volunteering.",
  "i understand how difficult that can be. is there anything else i could help you with today?",
  "i like to take wine tasting in the evening, it'll give me some time to reflect on my life.",
  "that sounds like a hard time, what about you could you perhaps make a video chat with your coworkers and tell them how you feel?",
  "thank you.",
  "yes, i believe you are right. so the coworker has to leave after work and spend a little time with the covid workers and the other workers.",
  "have you ever talked to your friends about this? maybe you could talk to them about how you are feeling and how you feel about this relationship.",
  "well, i hope that this will help you to figure out how to move forward and get through this.",
  "yes, you might be able to find something that would make you feel more comfortable. i've been in a similar situation myself.",
  "you are a good, caring person. i am sure you will be successful.",
  "i think you should be proud of yourself and not feel guilty about your relationship. i know how hard that must be. i was in a similar situation and it was really hard for me to get over it.",
  "i think it'll be ok. it'd be nice to be able to have someone to talk to about this. it sounds like it'sn't.",
  "i can understand that. i had similar situation and i had to quit my job when i got my promotion. it was very stressful.",
  "i would suggest going to the movies. the pandemics have been going on for a long time.",
  "i'm sure that will help you, especially if you have a lot on your plate.",
  "i think that you have to take the breath, and then you can focus on what you need to do to relax and make sure that the action you are trying to make is being aware of it.",
  "i understand that. do your family know of any other members that are suffering from these same issues? there is a lot of support out there for them.",
  "i think that's a good plan. i would be very concerned about her reaction.",
  "if you can't learn from online learning, you can learn from the teacher or professor.",
  "i understand. i have been in a similar situation. my mental health is not the best. it takes a lot of effort to get things right.",
  "i believe you are going to do just fine.",
  "i completely understand. it's very hard to be able to tell the truth, and even more so when you have to see what is going on in your life, and what you are capable of.",
  "that is very hard to do. i have had that happen before.",
  "i can understand that feeling. it is important to do what is best for you and to stay positive.",
  "i am so glad you are seeking professional help!",

  "you are very welcome. i hope i was able to help.",
  "do you feel like he is being unfaithful to you?",
  "i can see that. i have heard of people struggling with social anxiety and depression. are you able to find a way to cope?",
  "yes, it is very difficult. you need to find a new job or find a way to pay bills",
  "yes, this is true. it'll be hard to try and repeat the class again. i don't know if you would be able to get another opportunity at the same time as you passed the course.",
  "do you have a good resume?",
  "i think that'd be good for you to talk about!",
  "i know, it must be difficult to deal with this.",
  "i would start looking for a job right now.",
  "i have also done some work in the past with a supervisor who has done nothing to upset me. i think you have the courage to do what you feel is right.",
  "i think you should try to be more open to other people. even if it'snot a secret, you should be able to make a good decision about it.",
  "i would do the same",
  "i'm sure you are doing great. i think you deserve someone who understands you and will be there to help you through this.",
  "i know that's a very difficult situation to be in.",
  "no problem! i hope you have a great rest of your day!",
  "that is a great idea and i think it is a really healthy one, maybe try to be more open to new people and find new ways to get involved with them",
  "i know that's tough, but there are some online groups you can join that are always looking for new friends. i found that i was able to connect with many of my friends through online groups. i find that i've found that online groups have been helpful and i have found that a lot of people are still around.",
  "i know you're in a great position, i hope you have a good day and that your grades will be good for you.",
  "have you considered talking to your other cousin?",
  "yes, there are. and in the meantime, there is always volunteer work.",

  "i'm sure they will love you.",
  "yes, it helps me a lot.",
  "it may be time to take a break and do some reading or something.",
  "bye",
  "that is good. sometimes friendship is just an excuse for people to stay friends.",
  "that sounds like a great idea. i know it is hard to get people to agree with you but if you have a support system you can get through this.",
  "that is very kind of you to say, you are doing the right thing and that is an important step. i think you are the right one to do it, i would be proud if you were.",
  "i can see how that would be difficult to do.",
  "i think you can reach out to anyone who is willing to listen to your feelings and help you through this.",

  "i'm glad i could be of some help. i know that can be tough, but i think you're doing the right thing and making the world a better place.",
  "if you want to be honest, tell them you think they are not worth your time or money. i would tell them that if they are too hard on themselves, you will feel ashamed and feel bad.",
  "and i hope that you have been able to find comfort in the new world. i have had a rough year too, and know that we all need to look forward to it.",
  "no problem",
  "it depends on the person, some people just need the space. some people want to stay home, others want to take care of themselves.",
  "i understand how you feel. i am a stay at home mom and i've been in a similar situation. it'd be really hard to have someone who is so close to me that they would not like to change their way of thinking.",
  "have you tried reaching out to her on social media? maybe that can help her connect with you?",
  "it sounds like you have a lot of friends and family that could provide you some time to talk to them.",
  "yeah, definitely. that'll help a lot.",
  "i hope you are feeling better.",
  "have you considered looking into getting a travel group?",
  "no, i am not saying you are a philander. i am saying you should do what is right and you are not acting like doug'is not the issue. you are doing the right thing and you shouldn't feel guilty.",
  "merry christmas to you too.",
  "i know it can be hard to find a hold for a position like this, but i would suggest reaching out to your boss and asking them if they can help you with a job interview.",
  "yes, i do enjoy it. i feel that i have a good balance of income and i'm sure that you can find a good job.",
  "i'd be happy to help you out with the job search.",
  "bye!",
  "i'm glad that you are feeling better. i've been through it myself and it is definitely a process.",
  "it'd be better if you were aware of this and tried to talk to your friends and tell them how you feel.",
  "you have to be really careful about what you buy with your credit card, as it can be a lot of things to pay back.",
  "it sounds as though you two are very close. do you think you can talk to your friend about the change?",
  "i can tell you have a very strong girlfriend and i know it is hard to deal with the situation",
  "you are very welcome! i hope that this has been a great day for you!",
  "i have heard of that happening with my boyfriend before. he was in a relationship for years, and we had a lot of problems, and he was always willing to talk about it. he said that it was just hard for him to see that you were happy and happy, and that you both were happy with it.",
  "it'll definitely help to relax you before bed. it'd be a great idea.",
  "i can see how that would make you anxious.",
  "i am sorry that you are struggling.",
  "i see. i think it would be better to just let her know that you caught it, but that could lead to a conflict.",
  "well, i think that is a good thing that you are working on trying to stay on top of this and keep yourself busy.",
  "i know how you feel. i have had some of those issues myself and it was difficult.",
  "i think it is great to be honest about how you are feeling. i have experienced similar feelings and i found that it helped me to remember that there is someone better out there for me than me.",
  "i have a car and am looking for a new job. i live in an apartment so it's very difficult to move around.",
  "is there any way you can make it through this?",
  "that's a tough position to be in. how do you feel about the way that he's going about his work?",
  "i can understand how you feel. sometimes we just need to get through our own feelings and let things heal from this.",
  "you can try meditation or yoga.",
  "what about your parents?",
  "i understand how you feel. i have been in a similar situation myself and i have found that it is really difficult to be in a good place when there is someone who is willing to talk to you about it.",
  "i think that is a great idea. it's very useful to give yourself a plan to follow and follow your own hours.",
  "you are welcome.. i hope you have a great day.. : ) )",
  "i used too, but i started to find a gym membership online and started using that.",
  "that's a very mature and understandable decision to make",
  "you too!",
  "yes, i understand how you feel.",
  "i can understand how you feel",
  "you should be fine. i can tell that you have great grades!",
  "i've been going through similar things myself.",
  "i know the feeling. i am from florida and it is very cold here too.",
  "yes, we need to learn from this and work on our own time",
  "i can understand how you feel, especially since you are in a marriage. do you have anyone you can talk to about your feelings?",
  "i am glad you are feeling better.",
  "good! that'll help you get back to normal.",
  "you can tell them that you did not share their belief, and they will understand. you can do it.",
  "you too! you have a wonderful rest of your day too!",
  "meditation can be helpful, but i would suggest trying to think of ways to make yourself more aware of your surroundings and how you are doing.",
  "you as well!",
  "i'm glad you are taking care of yourself and are doing well.",
  "you as well!",
  "it'll be great to have someone who can help you, even if it'd be difficult for you.",

  "you are welcome. i hope you can find some way to make this better",
  "have you tried reaching out to your coworker and asking them if they could help you with a new job?",
  "have you considered seeking help from your partner?",
  "that is a good idea. do you have any other hobby?",
  "you should be a boyfriend! i hope you find the right person soon",
  "i know it is hard to let go of someone but it is also important to make sure you are doing what is right for you.",
  "i think it's important to take the survey and find out what people think of your boss.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "that sounds like a big deal. how long have you been together?",
  "yeah, i understand that.",
  "i'm glad i was able to help. i hope you feel better soon.",
  "what was the experience that you had a terrible experience in past?",
  "i can only imagine that it'd be hard to find work when you've been working in the same field for so long.",
  "maybe a book would be helpful. i would also suggest a good book for you to get some rest, just to be able to take some time to think about it.",
  "i like to play video games, which are fun to play with friends",
  "you too.",
  "i would start by looking for online jobs and looking for the best job you can find.",
  "you should tell family, it is important to tell them. if you tell them, they will understand that you are upset and have a reason for doing what you did.",
  "it was! thank you for talking to me.",
  "i think it's best to tell her that you feel that she doesn t trust you and that you do not want her to be around your kids.",
  "i think that if you've already tried, and she'd like to talk, then you can tell her that she'' s not being honest and it's okay.",
  "that is very unfortunate. i am glad you are trying to work through it.",
  "yes, it's very difficult. but you have to find a way to earn the money and move on.",
  "it sounds like you have already reached out to your school counselor to see if they can help you. i know that you can do this.",
  "i hope that i helped! i wish you the best!",
  "i had a lot of time on my hands and a lot on my plate. it was hard for me to find time for my child, i have no idea what made it happen.",
  "have you tried to do things with your friends or family?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i understand that it is very hard to be in a relationship with someone who is not in the same boat as you.",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "yes, i've been there. i had to talk to my husband about how i feel. he was really supportive.",
  "oh i see. i can understand that. i think you should speak to your therapist about the situation.",

  "i know it is hard for you right now, but it is better now than in the past. i hope that she can come out on top.",
  "i am also in illinois. i am not sure how to help you but i would like to talk. i hope that you will be able to come out of this depression and get help.",
  "i can see how it is difficult.",

  "that is great. i have been in your position before.",
  "you've been very welcome!",
  "i see. i understand how hard that can be to deal with.",
  "i can understand that. i have had a similar experience. i was in a position where i was working too long to be able to work, and i was not able to get a part time job. i found that a lot less work was needed.",
  "bye",
  "you can't control your partner's schedule. it doesn't matter what you plan, you can just control how much you stay with them.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that.",
  "have you tried asking your local government or any other groups?",
  "i've been to georgia and it was pretty cold. i have also been in a similar situation with the weather",

  "i think that you should take some time to take some deep breaths and try to be more positive about yourself. you can do it!",
  "i am so sorry you are going through this. have you tried to talk to her about it?",
  "i can feel your pain and anxiety in your head",
  "i see. i can understand how you feel. do you think that he will be able to make up for it in the end?",
  "do you have anyone close to you that you can talk to about it?",
  "i can understand how that would be hard. i think that it's important to focus on getting back together with your friend, even if it'll take a long time.",
  "it sounds like you are confident in your abilities, and that's very good.",
  "i have been in a similar situation. i found myself in a place of strength and i found that it has helped me to have a more positive outlook.",
  "i understand how anxious you are. it sounds like you have a lot of pride in being yourself and that is a good thing.",
  "i also love books and novels, i also like to play soccer games",
  "i know that is hard to hear. have you tried talking to her about this?",

  "it sounds like you are feeling a bit lonely. do you have any close friends that you can talk to?",
  "so she is not happy with the decision, and now she is going to move on from him.",
  "yes, you can. if you really want to get into it, you should get a job, or get a part time job, and pay your bills.",
  "i would definitely talk to your family about it. i would also try to get your children to a good school and have a safe home.",
  "i am so sorry to here that. i have had some pandemics as well. it can be very difficult. i know that in a lot of ways, we have been able to make progress in the medical field, but it is difficult to find a job that we enjoy.",
  "i'm so proud of you for reaching out to your colleagues. i would be worried about them looking at you and not being able to accept the job.",
  "that sounds like a great idea! you have been very patient with me.",
  "have you talked to him about it?",
  "that's great! i love that it is calming and peaceful.",
  "i can see that you feel like you are not ready to take on the responsibility of working from home. i hope you find a job soon!",
  "i've found that a good friend is always a good thing to have.",

  "that is really tough. i have had some difficult times as well. i know it can be a tough time.",

  "i can relate to that, i know how hard it is.",

  "oh no, i hope she is ok.",
  "it sounds like you are doing everything you can to try to get through this.",

  "i'm sorry to hear that. i have been in a similar situation and i can tell you are in the right path.",
  "well, i'd say that's all going on right now. we're not all in a relationship right now, but it's definitely been very difficult for us.",

  "you too, thanks for chatting",
  "what kind of work do you have?",
  "i see, so she is a good mom. i think that is important to keep her mind occupied and not let her feel like she is in control of her emotions. she is also not alone in this situation.",
  "it is a great song.",
  "i understand that. there are some people who will not take any steps back because of their depression.",
  "i am glad to hear it.",
  "that is good. i had a pandeic before, and i was in a lot more pain during the pandeics. i also had to wear mask for the mask i used for my job. i would wear a few mask during the day, but not for more than 3 hours a night.",
  "i am so glad that you are feeling better. thank you too.",
  "that is not good, you are doing the right thing by keeping your feelings low.",
  "i am glad to hear it.",
  "that's a good idea. if they do need help with their own work, they will be more likely to be willing to help out.",
  "you too!",
  "i see, maybe you can tell them that you feel that you have no real idea what is going on with your parents and that it is just a matter of time until you can speak to them.",
  "i think that's a great idea. it really helps to be able to find things that you've been able to do for you.",
  "i think you'll be fine.",
  "yes, i've done that before too.",
  "have you tried reaching out to a professional?",
  "it's really hard for me to understand how others are feeling, but i know that if you try to be kind to yourself and not get into the situation that is going on, you will be able to move on.",
  "i am sorry that happened. i have been in a similar situation before and it really sucks to be in a bad place.",
  "i am sorry you had to go through this, i am sure you are feeling a lot better now.",
  "i see. do you have any family or friends who you can talk to about this issue?",
  "oh that is a shame. is it possible that your friends have a plan to help you during the holidays?",
  "i am in school so i am not sure what to do. i think you could try online work and get an online job.",
  "oh ok. i am so sorry. is there anything else you can think of?",
  "well, if you want to talk more about your previous situation, we can talk about your past situation",
  "have you tried to talk to her about how you are feeling?",
  "you are most welcome! i hope that it was helpful to you and that you are still able to make some progress and get through this!",

  "i hope you feel better soon.",
  "you should take control of yourself and let your daughter know how much you love her.",
  "maybe it is time to start treating yourself differently.",
  "yes you should leave them.",
  "i would try to search online for local job. it will help you if they can give you some advice.",
  "you can try to make your own food. you could start with fruits and vegetables. you can make them from scratch. you will be surprised when you find out you are not as good as you thought",
  "you too!",
  "i have had a couple of patients who were on medication and they have had some success. i think you will be fine.",
  "that'd be a great start!",
