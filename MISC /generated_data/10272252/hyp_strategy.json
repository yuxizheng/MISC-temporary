  "i can see that. you are making a lot of money, but it'll be tough for sure.",

  "have you tried to talk to your friends and tell them you feel this way?",

  "i am glad you have found out the truth, it is very difficult to know when we will never find ourselves in a better place.",
  "how long ago was it?",

  "i think that's a great idea, it sounds like you are really trying hard and it'll only help you get back on track.",
  "i have, and she said it is easier to see her as a friend and not as an opportunity to be a boss. i have had a lot more success with that than not working at all.",
  "i've been in a similar situation before and it was a terrible experience. it's really hard to deal with when you're dealing with someone who has been cheating on you. do you think he is trying to take advantage of you? is he just trying to get you to forget about him?",
  "that is a good idea. and i would say if you are not there, maybe it is better to let him know you are there to support him. if you feel like you need to talk, maybe he can also get a break from the phone to take a nap.",
  "i know you are feeling like you are doing the right thing, but you are not there. i hope i can be of some help to you.",
  "i am doing okay, thanks for asking.",
  "that is understandable. i struggled with physics and math too. i tried to focus on other things like learning about cars, but it did not work.",

  "i think you are going to be able find another new job. i would suggest looking into job training or looking for an online job to help you find something.",
  "hi there! how are you doing?",
  "i've been in a similar situation, and it was pretty awful.",
  "i would tell them that you are not there for them and that you can not let them get in trouble because they will be there for you.",
  "you are very welcome. i hope you are able to find a job soon and i wish you all the best.",
  "i would try and reach out in person to your local government.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. why are you worried?",
  "have you thought of getting some kind of freelance work or just taking a short break and rethinking the options you have?",
  "you are very welcome! i am glad you are trying to get through it!",
  "do you think your parents are being reasonable?",
  "i understand that you feel that you have been feeling this way for a long time. i think you should seek some support from your friends.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "that is a very bad situation, i know how hard it is to move on from a partner",
  "how did i do it",
  "you'll be fine, i hope i was able to be of some help. have a wonderful day!",
  "i understand. it is important to be kind to yourself. if you can't do that, you can always try to distract yourself.",
  "that sounds very nice. i think you should try to do that as much as possible. i know you've tried to make this a goal for yourself, and i know that you'd be successful!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i hope that you can find some solution for yourself.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "i would google your local hospital or therapist. i think you will find a lot of resources. if you are feeling depressed, you should seek some support groups for that. sometimes i just take a walk in the park or drive to the park and it helps to get away from people who do not care. you can also seek some resources that are free. a friend of mine has a dog who is in need of a shelter, and he is able to help with a lot.",
  "you're welcome! i'd recommend playing some games you haven't tried yet. i have enjoyed playing call of duty.",
  "i am sorry you are in this situation. i have a friend who has a family member who is in the same situation.",
  "i agree! that'll help you realize who you really like and that if you aren't interested, then they aren'thing you are not interested in.",
  "that sounds like a really hard time to deal with. have you tried any physical exercises to help you calm down?",
  "it sounds to me like they are being very disrespectful to you and that you've been avoiding them.",
  "i would like to recommend reading some books about depression. there are some great ones and you can start by starting a book called \" depression by john machton \".",
  "i would recommend taking a deep breath and getting your body back to normal. i have found it helps me to get away from things that make me anxious.",
  "you'll have to take the course again after this, i hope you've done your best.",
  "okay. i'll end the survey with a response. please do not get discouraged, because we all have our own ways to cope with grief.",
  "i did not enjoy going on my own, i had to travel alone.",
  "so he was serious about your marriage but he talked about the relationship with you for awhile.",
  "i'd recommend that, it really helps to get some fresh air and a fresh shower.",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. do you have any other hobbies or hobbythings you would like to do?",

  "what do you mean by sad?",
  "i am glad i could help.",
  "yea it sounds like you are worried about losing your house. that is understandable",
  "that is really hard. i would feel terrible if someone i knew cheated on me. especially a man who has cheated on his wife and his kids.",
  "i think it'd be better if you did not want to spend the time with him in the first place, but you both should be able to work things out.",
  "i think it would be! maybe you could talk to your boss about how you are feeling and see if you can talk to them about it?",
  "so you gave her your heart back?",
  "hi how are you doing today?",
  "i think a housegift would be a great idea!",
  "yes, but i think with the vaccine coming it might be more of an issue.",
  "i can understand your concern about this, especially if you are not currently attending school.",
  "that sounds like a great plan!",
  "i would suggest you look into it as a start to a plan of action to eliminate the habit.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. how did you lose your job?",
  "do you have any friends in the same position?",
  "i am doing okay, what's going on?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that.",
  "you are not alone. i felt the same way when i was younger but i found it was worth it. it is hard to find someone to talk to.",
  "i know how frustrating it must feel to be like this.",
  "have you been able to talk to them about your feelings or issues with how they feel about your weight?",
  "yes, i would suggest starting to go to a gym or a gym class, and just focusing on your physical activity",
  "i'm good. what's going on with you today?",
  "i think you are doing the right thing and you are being extremely kind. i would encourage you to take some steps to make sure that you have a good relationship with your partner and not let it become a problem.",
  "it sounds as though your partner is the one who has to stay on top of everything. is there a way you can talk to him about this?",
  "it sounds like you are feeling upset because they thought you were busy and didn't want to go.",
  "i think it'll be ok, but it'd be nice to talk to someone who's willing to be honest.",
  "i'm glad to hear that. i hope you can get through this!",
  "i see. what's been going on?",
  "i had to speak to him about how the board is not being very helpful and how he is being a leader and not a boss. it was frustrating but i eventually found that i was being an adult and not being treated like an animal by my boss.",
  "im sorry i misunderstood. i have had to deal with similar feelings. its not easy, but i would suggest you talk to her again and see how she acts.",
  "i am here for you too!",
  "that'll definitely make you feel better!",
  "i hear you! i have been in that position before. i was really nervous too.",
  "that'll definitely help you out. i'd recommend talking to them about it, if they want to have a conversation with you.",
  "well, you might be able to work from home and do your job but you'll still have to do your own thing.",
  "i'll let you finish, but i have. i had to cancel my lease and move out, so i had my car payments paid for months before i was evicts. i ended up getting a lot more money and i was able to pay my mortgage.",
  "i can help you today.",
  "i hope everything works out for you.",
  "i don'think it's disrespectful at all!",
  "you are very welcome. i hope you feel better soon.",
  "i'd say you need to start thinking about your other partner. it might help you to be able to make a better decision.",
  "that sounds like a lot of work. i'm not sure how well that would work, but it is an awesome field to be in.",
  "i hear you. i was in a similar situation a few years ago. it took a while to get over the addiction.",
  "i hope everything works out for both of us!",
  "i have experienced issues with my own weight too and i can relate to that.",
  "bye. hope you have a great rest of your day.",
  "i believe you can. i believe in you bob.",
  "i see, you have spoken to other women in the past?",
  "that is really bad. do you think your boss has a problem with that?",
  "are there any other reasons you want to get it cut?",
  "sometimes when we feel like we aren't getting enough contact we just want to feel good about ourselves.",
  "you too!",
  "i was working at the military department of health.",
  "i think that is a good idea to take medication for those feelings.",
  "i am not sure what that means, but yes i excersize. i would love to hear your answer.",
  "bye!",
  "oh, that sounds very frustrating! can you explain why?",
  "you are welcome. i hope that you can talk it out with her!",
  "well, i do understand that you have both been in school and working together, but there is no need to rush to communicate.",
  "so you're feeling lonely because you feel alone.",
  "do you think he is cheating on you?",
  "wow. that is terrible.",
  "i've had my fair share of people come out of my marriage and they were not nice, but i know that if i were married i'd want to change things and change my life.",
  "thats good, i know how hard it is to be in a bad place. i know you will get through this : ) i hope you are feeling a bit better now.",
  "i am sure you will do great. it sounds very difficult to be in such a difficult position but i am confident you will make it through!",
  "i'm doing good too. how are you today?",
  "so you are not sure if you are being treated unfairly, or if you think your boss is being unfair?",
  "you too!! happy holidays!",
  "you are very welcome. it is great that you are able to talk to someone about this. it must be hard for you.",
  "what made it difficult for yourself?",
  "yes! you will be able too. it's important to remember that you are still learning and you can do your best to stay focused.",
  "i see, i hope that has helped.",
  "i think that is a great idea! take more of your time and try to focus on something you enjoy doing.",
  "that sounds like a great idea. i have found that if i do not reach out i usually just look for other things to do.",
  "it'll be a great opportunity to spend a little more time on things that you love doing. you can always spend some time on the internet, too. i believe there are plenty of resources online for people who are going through the same things.",
  "have a great day.",
  "i hope so, but it sounds like you're pretty intelligent.",
  "i understand how you are feeling.",
  "how are you feeling today?",
  "that's horrible. i'm so sorry to hear that.",
  "i can certainly relate to that. it can be very stressful when you have such a big group of people to ask questions for you.",
  "wow.. i am sorry to hear that, you sound like a very intelligent person.",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "i know it sounds crazy but i have a friend who is a wonderful person and is so supportive of me and my family. i also have a good support system for me. it is a very difficult time to be in a relationship but it is worth it.",
  "i can understand why you feel negative about your life. i also have experienced that.",
  "i can understand your concern.. i have been there before.. it is difficult to be honest with someone who is going through a difficult time.",
  "have you thought of reaching out to a friend or family member who may have been feeling the same way?",
  "i am glad i could be of some help",
  "yes i live in fl too",
  "hi how are you doing?",
  "i would suggest you do that. i am sure you will be able to make some new friends.",
  "lol, well i think you can still be a penniless american and not be able to vote either.",
  "i can imagine, that must be difficult. are there any activities that you enjoy that you can do on your own?",
  "that is good news, i am happy to hear that.",
  "i would like to help you with that as well.",
  "you are not supposed to lose your job, only gain it",
  "what made you feel so sad?",

  "you sound like a really smart person, and i think you will be successful in your future.",
  "yes, try to find a way to make him feel better.",
  "i think that'll be a good sign.",
  "do you think that the young people are more intelligent than you are?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what happened?",
  "it'll probably be different for you.",
  "i think that is definitely a good idea. you sound like a very positive person. have a great day!",
  "you are welcome. have a nice rest of your day!",
  "have you ever considered seeing a therapist or counselor?",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. i have been in a similar situation.",
  "i used to play piano when my friends were in school. it was hard but i was able to get better at it.",
  "what happened?",
  "is there anything you'd like to talk about?",
  "absolutely. i am so glad you are able to work it out and i hope that it has helped you.",
  "i can certainly relate to how you feel, when i was younger i would feel like i was being treated poorly and my anger would be directed at someone else, and it was very frustrating. i would always say that if i have an issue with my health, i will take it into consideration and try my hardest to take a few minutes at a time to calm myself down and get back to my normal routine. it is great that we have a support system in place to help our grandson. i hope that you are able to find some peace and comfort and relief in this situation.",
  "have you thought about looking for a different job?",
  "have you tried talking to your employer to see if they would consider you for another job?",
  "have you considered looking for another job?",
  "i wish you all the best with your plans. it is a very important day to stay busy and keep yourself busy.",
  "that would be a reasonable response. but if they do not care about you, they probably wont. i would try to be more proactive about reaching out to your friends and asking what is going on.",
  "i know it can be hard to talk about your feelings, especially when you are in a dark place.",
  "you are welcome i hope you feel better soon",
  "bye",
  "have you tried talking to someone about it?",
  "i think you'll do great! i hope you have a wonderful year ahead of you!",

  "hello how are you today?",
  "i am sorry to here that. i know it can be frustrating.",
  "bye!!",
  "i understand that, i've suffered from that before too. it can be very scary and you should definitely seek help.",
  "i hope i have been able to give you some advice.",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "i see, have you tried any other types of medication like melatonin?",
  "i am sorry to here that. you sound like a great person. i hope you find the strength to keep moving forward.",
  "i've had similar issues in the past where i felt that i couldn't get along and had to seek help from my therapist.",
  "you must be very upset because he is controlling you.",
  "i understand.. i have had a hard time myself too, but i went once and it helped me a lot. i went to a meeting where everyone was familiar with aa and it was a very positive experience.",
  "hi there how are you doing?",
  "i'd try to be firm and say that you miss what you were supposed to be missing and that you should be able too go ahead with your homework.",
  "i'd say that'll be a good thing! i know it'll help you a lot!",
  "hello! how are you?",
  "i know it sounds like we have been through the same thing but you are right. we can't talk about what is happening.",
  "i think it would be great if you did that. maybe you could ask people in your church for suggestions?",
  "ah weddings. that'll definitely be a nice time to get out. i've been out of the country for a bit too, but i'll keep on going.",
  "i can tell you are not feeling well enough, as you've clearly had a very hard time.",
  "that'll be a great activity to do in the short term, and i know it can be very useful for your mental health.",
  "bye",
  "i am sorry to hear that. why do you feel that way?",
  "do you have any hobbies?",
  "oh, that's great.",
  "you too!",
  "i think it's natural to feel this way.",
  "it sounds that you are really working hard at making the effort to keep your budget tight and keep on trying, and i can tell that you have been trying hard to keep yourself in mind and make sure you keep on working.",
  "i understand. i feel the same way. it's hard to talk to someone who doesn't feel like they can help.",
  "i think he probably is, and i think that you should talk to him about it",
  "i see. so he is not giving you a reward for your work?",
  "that'd be a great place to look. i hope you find something you enjoy doing and enjoy your new career path.",
  "perhaps he has an agenda that is not being explored at all. maybe he'd be interested in trying to find something else to do with his time.",
  "you can still hang out by your friends",
  "i wish you all the best with everything. i know it'll be tough, but i've learned to accept that it'sn't easy, and i'll definitely be able to do it again.",
  "i know it is tough. i was laid off a month ago as well. i'm really sorry to hear you got laid.",
  "what kind of work do you want to be in?",
  "i'm good thanks, how are things going?",
  "that sounds like a great idea. it might help to just let her know how you feel and how you are feeling.",
  "i think you will be able to make the transition.",
  "i am sure that she will find a job in her future. i myself am sure she will.",
  "you're feeling really anxious and anxious about the stock economy right now?",
  "oh okay, i understand.",
  "it is a good time to remember that you are doing your duty, and your job is important.",
  "i am happy to help.",
  "that sounds really stressful. i've been in your shoes before.",
  "i think it would be a great idea. you can work from home with your kids. it might help to have a break from him. you need to be able to connect. i think your husband is being lazy.",
  "how are you feeling?",
  "i am glad that i was able to help.",
  "no problem : ) hope i was able to help!",
  "that sounds rough. have you tried talking to your doctor about it?",
  "oh no! that is a very scary situation to be in. i can understand why you are concerned about her.",
  "i wish you all the best with this. it must be really hard for you, but you can make it through this!",
  "it was difficult to make the decision to go there as it seems that you would have to make a lot of decisions to meet someone there",
  "i've had some friends who were in the same situation. it's been really hard but i think it will work out for you!",
  "is there anything specific that you'd like to talk about?",
  "hi there, how are you?",
  "i'm sorry you are going through this.. i know how hard it is.. but i hope you can get help from a family friend or someone you trust.",
  "it's good to have a hobby that can help you stay motivated.",
  "i agree, it is a difficult year for everyone.",
  "you are very welcome.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "do you sell on etsy or amazon? i have been in a similar situation before and i know how stressful it can be.",
  "it is, but that is not the only way to deal with the issue.",
  "i would suggest taking some time away from school to get your mind off of it and just focusing on your studies.",
  "oh no, that's awful. how are you feeling?",
  "is there something else that you've wanted to talk about today? maybe some other things you'll be able to discuss with your team?",
  "i am also a male teacher",
  "i think that if he is going through a tough time in life, he should be able to take care of himself. maybe he will need to make a plan for his own financial situation and do some research.",
  "i think it'll be great to have that vaccine by mid year, since there's still some time left.",
  "you can try to spend more time outside. it may help to take a break from the gym and do something fun.",
  "have you tried talking to your friends or family about this?",
  "i am fine. is there anything else you wanted to talk about?",
  "i think that is the truth. it is so hard to find a solution to our problems, especially when we are dealing with so many people.",
  "you too",
  "do you think that you should talk to your friends about this and see what they can do about this?",
  "you too!",
  "it sounds as though you are being a good person and that you should seek out professional help.",
  "it's nice that you are getting some support from someone, it'll be helpful to keep yourself busy.",
  "i hear you. i am in the same boat as you. it'll be tough to find anything to do when you are so tired.",
  "that sounds like a great first step, and i think you've made it a goal to work towards it.",
  "it sounds like you are working really hard to get yourself out of this funk. you sound like a strong person.",
  "i'm sorry to here that you're suffering from pain. i've been there myself, and it can be very painful. it's good you have family to support you.",
  "hi, how are you today?",
  "thats what im saying! sometimes we just gotta take a little time to look back on the positive things we did in our life.",
  "i understand how anxious you are right now, but i think you will be fine.",
  "i can understand how you feel, i also have been in a similar situation. i had to stop drinking for awhile due to covid and i was having a hard time doing it again.",
  "how are you?",
  "you will be fine. you can do it!",
  "i have found that it helps to relax in the evening. i also find that it can help to be quiet.",
  "you are very welcome.",
  "i am glad to hear that. i am sure that you will find someone to talk to soon!",
  "i would be very nervous that you are being made uncomfortable by this.",
  "it is a very difficult time, but it will take some time to find your love.",
  "i am glad i could be of some help. i hope you find a solution soon!",
  "is there something specific that bothers you about him?",
  "you too!",
  "you are so welcome! i wish you all the best with your new life and all the luck!",
  "i am really sorry to here that you have not been able to go on because you feel bad about it.",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that, that must be really difficult.",
  "i personally enjoy listening to music and sometimes it makes me happy.",
  "i know this can be frustrating, but if you have a manager who will take your concerns seriously, you can get a call back from him.",
  "i believe you could, but if he's not willing to open up to you, i'd suggest you try a more honest approach first. if he doesn ; t want you back, then it'll be best to end the relationship.",
  "i've had professors like that before. they are not good for you at all.",
  "that is tough. do you have a job?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, is there something you would like to talk about?",
  "oh wow, that's a long time. i would be upset too. is there anything you'd like to talk about?",
  "you have to make time for yourself.",
  "does he have any other hobbies that he enjoys doing?",
  "i live in the south and i've been having trouble staying inside during the holidays.",
  "i am glad to hear it.",
  "i did. i also used to drink coffee and eat bread with my family.",
  "i see, well, i'm glad that you've got that sort of perspective. i wish you the best of luck with everything you'll go through.",
  "i know that it can be overwhelming to be working so hard. have you tried to have your kids sit down with you and talk to you about what is going on?",
  "that is a very difficult situation to be in. i can understand how you feel. have you tried talking to your doctor?",
  "i would recommend doing a little searching online, it can be helpful to take a few minutes to find local resources.",
  "have you tried contacting them and explaining that you are having a hard time finding a job?",
  "i'll tell you what i think... if she doesn't respond then you don'; t do the thing. but if she does, then you should be able to talk to her.",
  "i think you should do what is best for your children. you should be proud of them and your commitment to them.",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. you are not the only one who is worried about their abilities.",
  "you should have done your part.",
  "it sounds like it was natural. what types of health issues did he have?",
  "it definitely does take time, but you will be able to work on things that will help you. and even if it doesn't, you will feel better in the long run.",
  "yes i have been on tour and have had some fun times.",
  "i can see how that would make you feel depressed. what do you think is bothering you most?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what's going on?",
  "i think it can be helpful to try to figure out what to do to get back on the same path as you and if you feel you have time for yourself, you can also try to work on your self esteem and mental health.",
  "maybe you could take a walk or do a walk outside in the park. it may help to take a deep breath, and then get back to your normal normal thoughts.",
  "i have been there before. my experience has been positive. i was in a very similar situation in the past and it was a lot harder than i thought.",
  "that's a very big step. it is a big responsibility to take care of yourself.",
  "it could be that the software doesn't work by hand.",
  "i started with the job market, and then i went to a local job training program.",
  "i have found that talking to someone who has been through the same thing is helpful.",
  "there are a few therapists available. they may be able to help you through this.",
  "thank you so much! you are wonderful. i am happy to help you! please reach out anytime.",
  "i am so glad you are feeling better.",
  "i went on walks and got exercise, it helped a lot.",
  "i would consider that, but it sounds like you are more concerned about what you can do with your time rather than what you are currently doing. i think that you might be right to think that it would be beneficial for you to take some time off.",
  "oh no! so you are pregnant and you are worried about your daughter's health?",
  "i see. well, i believe girls are more than capable of reasoning with their friend because they know how to play the situation. i believe they want the best for everyone and if girls pick fights with their boyfriend or girlfriend it's because they feel they need to be treated like an equal and if they can't be treated as such then they don't deserve to be in a relationship.",
  "no problem, i'm glad i was able to help you!",
  "it is always good to get out there and talk to people and not only have a good time but also have a great support system around you",
  "thanks for the suggestion!",
  "have you tried speaking to your fiancé to see if she wants to speak to you?",
  "i hope so too! i am so sorry to hear that. i am glad you had a good trip this year though!",
  "i would do it",
  "i understand how you feel. i have been in a similar situation. my parents did not want to be friends with me because they were angry with me.",
  "i think it's important to be honest with people. it'll help us understand what we're doing wrong.",
  "i understand your feelings. i have been in a similar situation. i felt that i had to give up and seek help.",
  "i think they might be more open to your decision.",
  "yes, that is a great resource. i think you can find some good recipes online.",
  "i understand how you feel and i know it will be a very difficult time for you.",
  "i understand how you feel. i also had a friend who cheated on me, and she cheated on him and i was like... ok, i didn't know. i thought it was cheating but he told me he cheated on my ex and then he cheated again. i was very upset and mad.",
  "well, you can't do anything to stop the situation from happening. you can do anything else you want to do.",
  "i think you should talk to your manager about it.",
  "i understand. i have been in that situation myself. i understand how it feels to feel that you've not been able to provide for your family. i know how much it hurts when that happens.",
  "what state are you in?",
  "of course. i hope that you're able to find a way to get out of this funk and find some peace.",
  "that is true. i also love star war. do you like star wars?",
  "i've definitely felt that way before. i also found that even if i'd fail, i'll always be able too because i know that i'n doing my best!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what is going on?",
  "that sounds like a really hard time. you feel like you're going to have to work out for 4 weeks. is that correct?",
  "is there any way you can get back in touch with your boss?",
  "i would be glad to help",
  "you too!",
  "oh wow that's not good. it sounds like you're a bit worried about your relationship with him though, and he's trying to make you feel better about it.",
  "you are welcome",
  "there are also opportunities for employment online. you could look into that.",
  "i understand how you are feeling. i had a similar problem when i was in a relationship and had to cut off contact with someone because i felt like i was being abused. i tried to talk to a therapist and they were able to help me figure out how to cope with this situation.",
  "you should try to communicate with them and keep them close.",
  "i am glad to hear that. how are you today?",
  "you are welcome, i'll keep you in my thoughts.",
  "i see, you might want to give it another shot. i think it is important to be able to recognize that you are doing the right things and you have a good heart.",
  "you'll get through this! i know you are feeling great!",
  "i completely understand how that feels. i have also had to work in the past.",
  "i know it sounds hard, but it is ok to be sad. i know you are trying your best.",
  "do you think you could plan something fun for her?",
  "i know it can be tough when the pandemic is coming up",
  "good... i hope you feel better.. i hope this helps",
  "you too!",
  "how often do you take your sleep pills?",
  "i think you are being too hard on yourself. it is very natural to feel that way.",
  "is it possible that your partner has some sort of financial support system that could help you?",
  "hello. i am here to listen. what is your problem? can you tell me?",
  "you too",
  "that is a great idea. do you have any friends or family that you can talk to about this?",
  "bye",
  "i also think that focusing on goals can help with your motivation.",
  "oh ok, so you are struggling with calculus?",
  "what type of news are you talking about?",
  "it sounds like you are trying to make yourself feel better, even if it'll be frustrating.",
  "just be there for your friend and show them what you love.",
  "i am here, and you too",
  "i can see how that would be stressful. i think that you are trying to figure out what to do with your feelings, and i think it would be good to get help from your spouse to help you with that. have you tried talking to your partner about the issue?",
  "do you think you will be able to take some online classes online?",
  "i've heard a few people say that they are afraid of being underpaid.",
  "yes, the virus will not stop her but we will find out if she is abandoned or not.",
  "i would suggest trying to do something to distract yourself. if you feel that your boyfriend is taking advantage of you, maybe you should talk to someone who knows better than you.",
  "well, i would start with the first few steps, then move up from there, but there are some online courses that are very good, like courseras for business management, i personally liked it.",
  "it sounds like you are a very strong person. you have already tried to reach out for advice and suggestions. you are making a great decision!",
  "what's making you feel this way? i can understand how you feel, but can you explain why you're not leaving the house?",
  "i'm glad to hear it, i hope you have a lovely day!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. can you tell me more about it?",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "she sounds lovely! garbo is wonderful! she'll get over that!",
  "good luck with everything!",
  "and you can be more efficient at the tasks you do, but at the same time, you will feel overwhelmed with your task at the end of the night.",
  "why do you think this is?",
  "did he leave the purse or just leave it in there?",
  "that's a good idea. i know you're really struggling with the situation, but i think you should try to make the right decision.",
  "i can definitely understand your concern. it's very difficult to deal with people who are afraid of you and their children.",
  "i'ma sorry to hear that. what do you do?",
  "it sounds like your supervisor is not doing his job well.",
  "i am doing well. thanks for asking. how can i help you today?",
  "i am sorry to hear that you are feeling depressed and it is hard to cope with this but i know you can do it.",
  "i hope that i was able to help you. i can't help you from here : )",
  "i think it might be best to talk with them first. if they do not care you should try to talk it out with them.",
  "do you have a family member who would be willing to help you through this?",
  "is it a long project?",
  "hello, how are you feeling today?",
  "have you considered talking to your fiancé about the current restrictions on marriage?",
  "it sounds like you're feeling a bit down about this. is there something specific that is bothering you that you'd like to discuss with your family?",
  "that is a great idea, volunteering can help you feel connected to other people. i think that would be a great start!",
  "i had a conversation with someone about how i felt and i did my best to communicate. i found that talking to someone about this was helpful. i would suggest that you try to do the same.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i am sure you are feeling stressed.",
  "that'd be a very difficult thing to go through.",
  "well, maybe you should consider what're best for your family. i think that your family and your parents will be very happy if you go into engineering.",
  "that sounds really rough.",
  "bye",
  "oh no that is not good, did you have any plans for the date?",
  "ok, i understand",
  "absolutely! i am a stay at home mom and i really love to play soccer and playing football.",
  "what happened?",
  "i'll be praying that things will get better for you. what about christmas?",
  "have you tried to eat less and exercise more?",
  "i think it'll help you feel better.",
  "so you are feeling isolated and you are not able to make friends or family?",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that, i also have autoimmune issues. i've had to be on immunosuppressant meds for about ten years now. i know how scary it can be. i was also diagnosed with ulcercolitis when i was younger and i was scared too.",
  "that'd be so hard, i've had to deal with people like that before. it'd make me sad too.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "you're welcome!",
  "of course! good luck with that. i hope you're able to get through this!",
  "have you tried any of these strategies?",
  "i hope you have a lovely day and get to go out and have a nice time!",
  "are you able to find any sort of work while you are searching?",
  "i understand that feeling. it'll be okay!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what happened?",
  "do you think you are going to have to rethink your life?",
  "i understand that you feel upset and upset about the breakup and your feelings towards her. do you think that you could help her?",
  "haha, i see. i see that now! i thought that might be a little strange. i would recommend that you do some online activities that you enjoy doing, such as reading, video chatting, or playing video games.",
  "that is a really hard situation, i would suggest contacting a counselor or counselor group that you can find some support from. it may be worth looking into.",
  "you are being negative because you have felt like you have not been given back your parents'work.",
  "you too!",
  "i'm doing well. how are things with you? what would you like to talk about?",
  "ah that sounds like a really tough time. is there any way you could make extra money as a way to survive? maybe you can save some money for a rainy day or something?",
  "i am doing well, thanks for asking. how can i help you today?",
  "what kind of pets do you think you might have?",
  "what are some of your concerns?",
  "haha! it'll be tough but we'll get there!",
  "do you think you could talk to her about your feelings?",
  "it's hard, but i know you can. we all have to start somewhere.",
  "have you tried to find a way to keep yourself busy while studying?",
  "i would say you should take some time to think about how you feel about this.",
  "from the internet, i'd recommend looking for online employment, and looking for jobs online. there are a lot of opportunities out there for you to look at.",
  "it'll be a good night. i hope everything goes well for you.",
  "yes, i have. it is very difficult for people with mental health issues to deal with it.",
  "have you thought of starting a group effort or maybe a group chat?",
  "hi how are you today?",
  "oh no, that'sn't good. i think you're being too careful about that.",
  "i can see how that would be stressful for you.",
  "i understand that. i think that's the best way to handle things. are you worried about getting laid off or something else?",
  "it'll be okay, i hope i have helped you.",
  "why are you angry?",
  "i think that you need to take a deep breath and take deep breaths. i believe in you.",
  "i see. so you are frustrated because you are not getting the grades you need to be successful in your studies?",
  "that'll make you happy and feel better. i hope you are able to get some relief.",
  "i would be afraid that it will make you feel more alone. are you in a social circle?",
  "well, i know that if you talk to your coworkers or any other employees in a public setting, they will be more than willing to help. they don'; t need to be directly available. i think that it would be best to find a way to be honest with them.",
  "yes, it is great that you are able to take a few more days off.",
  "you should be happy with that, and you seem to have the confidence that you can make it through this.",
  "i'm sure that you will be able to resolve the issue if you can, but i'd recommend reaching out to the family members who know your situation and are willing to listen to your concerns.",
  "hi there! how are you today?",
  "i am sure that you are feeling a little more relaxed after you switch careers.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. it seems like you are not having a good time at home.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. are you in school?",
  "i can understand that feeling. i am a supervisor and have had a similar experience.",
  "have you tried to talk it out with her?",
  "you too!",
  "i know it can be difficult for a lot of people to deal with depression, but there are some therapists who will recommend medication if you need it.",
  "oh no, that's really hard. i've been in that situation before, and i know how difficult that can be.",
  "i'd like to know how it goes. i am sure you'll do great.",
  "oh no, why are you sad?",
  "i'll be there! thank you for asking.",
  "i've been in a similar situation before. it'd be hard to know how to end a friendship if someone makes you cry or upset when you get home though.",
  "hi, how are you doing today?",
  "it can be a challenge but you can do it!",
  "perhaps you could try to take some time away from the house and then spend it with your family?",
  "you're welcome! i hope you feel better now.",
  "you are welcome! have a great rest of your day!",
  "i have a feeling that you might need to speak to someone if you want to get your emotions out of control.",
  "that sounds like a great idea! i think it would be a great start! i am sure that you will be able to find a therapist that is willing to help you and you will feel much better when you see one.",
  "do you feel that you might have some other problems going on in your life?",
  "yes i have also tried many things out here to try to get my sleep pattern better in better condition.",
  "i am good, thanks for asking! what is bothering you?",
  "ok",
  "do you have any other hobbies?",
  "you've got this! i hope you feel better about the next time you get it!",
  "i have been in a similar situation before, i went through a breakup once, and it was a very tough time for me, especially since i was looking for a new job. but i had to get a job to pay the bills, so i had the time of my life to work with others and help them build their own homes.",
  "i know that can be hard to deal with. i would suggest taking a walk in the park to get away from the people that make up your paper and then going back to work.",
  "i think it's a very normal situation. you are definitely not alone in this. do you think it could be worth looking into?",
  "i used to play videogames, like the walking dead. i also spent a lot of time outside with nature.",
  "i can tell that you are doing a great job, and you are being honest. you have a great outlook.",
  "i am sure you will do fine!",
  "have you tried to speak to your cowork supervisor and ask them about the new supervisor?",
  "i am good. is there anything i can help you with today?",
  "hello! how are you?",
  "i think you should try and keep your head up and keep working hard and stay motivated! it is never easy to be in a bad place.",
  "i understand how you feel. i have been in this situation before and i can relate.",
  "so you feel you're going to be okay if you stop being with your partner?",
  "i understand that feeling very well, i am currently going through the same thing with my wife. she is out for two months and i am not sure if i'll be able to see her or not. i would definitely feel the same way as you do if i were in your shoes.",
  "i have been in a relationship like this before and it was really rough.",
  "i've been in that situation a few times and it was really tough. i know you can do this!",
  "i am sorry, it must be hard to be so open about your feelings. have you spoken to your doctor about this?",
  "that sounds like a very good idea. you both are in a good place.",
  "i think that the first step is to take a step back and not let things get in the way of your productivity. i know that'll take a while, but you have to start from the bottom.",
  "i think it'd be helpful to talk to someone who has experienced similar circumstances.",
  "i don't think you've wasted your three years. i think that you have a lot of responsibility to grow and keep living and fulfilling yourself.",
  "thank you so much for chatting. i really enjoyed your time. i wish you all the best.",
  "i think it is great that you are interested in getting a pet that can help you with your daily life.",
  "what happened?",
  "that sounds very difficult, is there anything you'd like to talk to your doctor about?",
  "how did things turn out for you? did you have a plan in place for the relationship?",
  "i think that would make you feel a lot better. i think you will be okay, it'll be okay!",
  "okay, i can tell you have a lot of confidence in yourself.",
  "i've been well.",
  "i hope you get some sleep soon and i wish you all the very best!",
  "i can understand how you feel. it's been a long time since i took college classes.",
  "i can feel how you feel and you should let it go but you are still going to have a good time with her. if she doesn't want to talk then you should not do it.",
  "wow. that sounds like a very stressful situation.",
  "i can understand that it can be hard when people are ignoring their feelings.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what's going on?",
  "i've had a similar situation happen to me before. it was very frustrating, especially since i was trying to make a better life for myself.",
  "it sounds like you've been trying really hard to stay focused, and i think that's a great way to look at things. i know that you can do it!",
  "exactly! that'd be a great first step, then you could be more productive!",
  "sometimes it is better to forget them. sometimes it would just be better just forget about them and dont have any friend. sometimes that is the best option.",
  "i'd suggest you start focusing on taking some deep breaths and focusing on your own issues. that'll help you be more productive.",
  "you are making the right decision. but you need to be sure you are doing the right things.",
  "i am a real one.",
  "yes music is a great way to relax and have a good night.",
  "do you feel that he might be able to reach out to you again?",
  "what is the issue with your pandemics?",
  "i'm doing well, thanks for asking. how can i help you today?",
  "i have been feeling the same way lately, i have felt like i am losing my mind and i am having trouble keeping myself in focus. i hope that helps!",
  "it sounds like you are having a hard time communicating with your children. is that correct?",
  "it is hard to move on from a partner, but it is normal to feel that way.",
  "i think you'll be great! i hope you have a wonderful holiday!",
  "i think it would depend on if he has been faithful to you in the past",
  "it's been a pleasure talking with you. have a wonderful day.",
  "i'm doing well, how are things with you? do you have anything you'd like to talk about?",
  "i understand how you feel. i lost my husband a couple years ago. it was a hard time but it was worth it. you can always start looking for other jobs.",
  "i think that if you stay in a relationship with them, they will understand. it'll be hard to find a partner that can provide for you.",
  "that sounds like a great idea, i'd love to travel.. i'll bet that would be a great opportunity to do that. have you tried any new hobbies?",
  "i understand that. but at least you've been able to get a job that's not in your favor.",
  "okay, so you are feeling lonely because you are not good enough for her.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what's going on?",
  "is it a difficult subject?",
  "ah, well i think that would really help. i've been there before. i had a hard time getting a job because i worked so hard. it took a while for me to get one, but i got one after a while.",
  "hello! how are you today?",
  "you've definitely got this! i wish you all the best.",
  "oh, wow. that'll be a very difficult time for you and your friend.",
  "i understand that. and i don ; t think we should be ashamed of ourselves for not being able to write what we like. i think you can do it!",
  "do you have any hobbies or hobbythings to do that you enjoy doing?",
  "i would not kill her. i would suggest that you do something you truly love and that you can move on from this situation.",
  "you are not alone. it is important to keep yourself safe.",
  "i can understand how stressed you are. it is important to take care of yourself",
  "i think that you should be able to make friends again and see if that is what you really want. i know that you can feel better about yourself after this long.",
  "have you tried talking to your doctor?",
  "i'm glad to hear it. i have been doing mturk for years now. i've been able to make money on turk and mturk.",
  "i'm sorry, i am sure that you are not alone.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. how long have you been here?",
  "absolutely!",
  "it is hard to think of a situation like that. it is difficult to see people you care about when you are living in a bad situation.",
  "yeah, i think people do it that way to make themselves look better. it's so easy to be wrong!",
  "i am glad i could help.",
  "ah, well that's a good idea. i would like to know where you are looking for work and whether you can get a job in six month time.",
  "that's great! it's good that you have a counseror.",
  "thank you! i hope it was helpful.",
  "i know that it is hard right now, but you have to keep searching.",
  "i hope that it does!",
  "i hope so as well.",
  "i am so glad to hear that. i am sure you will find a good relationship with him soon.",
  "i can see your concern.",
  "i can understand why you feel that way. i also have a hard time sleeping at night, it is really hard for me.",
  "thank you. i hope you have a wonderful christmas night and can help me too.",
  "i can relate to that. the uncertainty of the future can lead to a lot of problems.",
  "have you tried to talk to the government about this?",
  "it sounds like you are putting your best foot forward and she is putting your feelings first.",
  "no problem. i hope things work out for you.",
  "i'm doing well, how are things with you? what is bothering you? : )",
  "god placed her to you for that girl, also",
  "i can understand how that would be very challenging for you. have you considered any other hobbies?",
  "haha, i can't believe i just got that message from you",
  "what seems the issue?",
  "you're welcome!",
  "i hope you feel better and that god bless you",
  "thats great, and thats the best thing to do, just let her know how you feel",
  "it is definitely a tough situation.",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "wow i have never heard of such a thing, i am from the uk. we are a very poor country",
  "i am happy i was able to help. it sounds like you are very mature about this.",
  "i do not have any help in person, but i would like to suggest you to seek professional help.",
  "i've been in a similar situation, i would have loved to have been able to go to a wedding but he didn't want to leave me.",
  "that is really tough. it must be really hard for you.",
  "i completely understand. it is important to find the right group to help. it sounds as though you are very committed to your studies. i think that is a great way to help yourself.",
  "you as well!",
  "i always do that. it helps me to keep calm and not have to worry about anything else.",
  "i am glad that she is able to help you get through this.",
  "if you want to get really far in a work you are doing, you might want to look into the chrome extensions that you are able to add to your browser. they can show you how much money you earn and how much your hits are worth.",
  "yes i understand that. it is hard to move when you are feeling down. you are not alone.",
  "do you think you have any other interests besides your partner?",
  "i am very glad that i could help you out.",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "i understand that. i have felt lonely also because i couldn't have people around to talk to at all.",
  "you are welcome.",
  "haha i bet they're very happy to be with you.",
  "what are your family issues?",
  "yes, i have. it is really hard.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what is the problem?",
  "i hope you can be better. bye",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i would like to encourage you to reach out to support groups that may be able to help you through your issues.",
  "thank you, i'd love to listen to some music and have a nice conversation with you.",
  "i'd be angry too if my partner was controlling me. i wouldn't want him to do that.",
  "i think volunteering could be a great way to make a difference in your future.",
  "i think it is important to make sure that you have a positive perspective on things and that you are willing to let her know that she is not worth having in your life. sometimes, we just have to sit down and talk to her and try to work things out in a way that does not involve getting in the middle of a long argument.",
  "i think that would be a good idea. it's a very important thing to bring up.",
  "so you feel that you have been feeling sad for a long while?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. how long were you together?",
  "thanks! that'sn't a problem.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i have had similar situations. it was a terrible experience. you should be proud of yourself.",
  "hi, that sounds very stressful. can you tell me more about your feelings?",
  "you are welcome and i am glad you are feeling better",
  "that is great that you are not afraid to do it and that is very helpful.",
  "i did indeed. i was surprised to find out that i was only offered a few hundred a month. i had to spend a bit more on loans though. i found it a little bit more valuable than the real estate packages.",
  "that is a very difficult situation to be in.",
  "no i am not a psychologist. i do have a job that i want to go into though.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. you can also try talking to them via video call or even text.",
  "i understand that, i have a friend who is having a stressful time too.",
  "i think she may have a better idea of how to approach it though",
  "so you are a student?",
  "i've had a similar situation in the past with a job before and i can definitely relate to the stress and anxiety. i know how you feel.",
  "well you can always try something different.",
  "i know, i think we can all agree on that.",
  "what is making you feel this way?",
  "i am glad that i could help. i wish you all the best and enjoy the rest of your weekend!",
  "i see, so you don't want to tell them that you feel that way?",
  "i understand that. it is so frustrating when we have to take a step back and think about what we have learned from our past mistakes.",
  "i understand how difficult it can be, but i think there is a way to move forward.",
  "i appreciate that! i hope you'll feel better soon!",
  "i've been there myself, it'll be a lot easier to do when you feel like you're not doing your job correctly.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, what's going on in your life that you're having such a hard time?",
  "that must be very difficult. is there a way you can talk to your employer about the situation?",
  "how long ago did you break up",
  "i understand that feeling. how do you feel about the fight?",
  "yes, there are. there are even medical journal sites to help you with that.",
  "i would suggest you both take some time to think about it and then you will be able to talk it out.",
  "hey larry, how are you today?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. it sounds like you are suffering from a lot more than just migraine though.",
  "that is true and the only way that you can tell who is leaving is by asking if they are still there.",
  "i can relate to how you are feeling.",
  "i have had to deal with similar issues in my life. have you tried to talk to anyone about it?",
  "i hope you feel better soon!",
  "it is great that you are motivated to start a new business. i am sure you will be successful.",
  "yea it's definitely a tough time right now and it'll be hard when you're not able to afford to pay your bills. do you live alone?",
  "it sounds like you are stressed about it.",
  "if she is depressed, i'm sure you are not going to be able to solve the problem.",
  "i would suggest you to just tell him you are scared and that you don't know what he is doing.",
  "have you tried calling them?",
  "that's definitely not good. it'd be nice to have some time to do something fun and relaxing.",
  "try to date that will make you smile",
  "thats really great to know that you were there for him. i have been through a similar situation myself.",
  "oh okay. it's a supplement that can be used to treat many different things.",
  "you are welcome. it was nice talking to you.",
  "no, it's a personal computer program that helps me find ways to communicate with my friends",
  "you too : ) i am glad i could help",
  "i have been in a similar situation to you. i had to write down what i was doing and then it was like a journey to healing and i started writing down what happened.",
  "that'll happen eventually. i believe you will find someone in the future, and even if you don't, there are plenty of people out there who are still there who will love you.",
  "well, i'd suggest doing some research online and finding a support group to help you through your breakups. you can look up online groups for people who are in your situation.",
  "i would think that you have been doing that already and it's important to put your feelings first. you know your clients and your health.",
  "i can see how that would be hard. it sounds like you've already spoken to her and tried to make a plan to get things done, and that seems like you really want to get to know her better.",
  "yes, i think you are the best choice. i would also try to keep your distance from their comments until you can find a solution to your problem.",
  "so i understand how you are feeling. it is hard to be alone.",
  "i think that is a good way to start. it may also help to make the conversation less serious.",
  "i completely understand. i also find it difficult to socialise. i do enjoy being alone and trying new things.",
  "thank you! you can hit quit and i will end the conversation!",
  "i'd definitely say that that sounds very painful. have you tried to talk to your partner about it?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that.",
  "what is your problem with the relationship?",
  "i find that focusing on your positive experiences with your father can help a lot.",
  "i would suggest a therapist, they are a great source of support.",
  "i understand - i feel the same way. i'm sure you can get through this.",
  "i am doing well, how can i help you today?",
  "have you tried to talk to them about it?",
  "i can feel you",
  "ok, do you have any other hobbies that you enjoy?",
  "sometimes it is good to be able to talk to someone and let them know that you care about them and that you do not want to take advantage of them. that way you can make peace with them. is that right?",
  "i like to read, play videogames, and also spend time on my friends and family when we can.",
  "yeah, i do too.",
  "i can understand that. it must be hard to find a job like that",
  "i think that is a good idea. it is better than talking about someone you don't know well.",
  "i'd do that too",
  "it sounds like you're really doing a great job, and i think you've got the right idea that you'd be willing to work with your family to get her medicating.",
  "i understand that. sometimes people who are not very good at expressing their frustrations do not realize how bad they are being.",
  "i see. well, i think you'll do okay! i think that's the best thing to do.",
  "you too!",
  "goodbye, i hope things go well for you too. have a great day : ).",
  "i think that you should definitely talk to your therapist and get some advice.",
  "oh that'll be a great start! i definitely agree! i also have two cats myself. they're great company and can provide a great support network and great company when you need it.",
  "you are welcome! i wish you the best of luck!",
  "is there anything specific that is bothering you?",
  "i hope you will find something soon!",
  "have you ever tried speaking to your doctor or counselor about the accident? it might be helpful to talk with them and see if they are able to help you out in the meantime.",
  "what is your major? i know that you are worried about your grades, but if it really is about your academics then you can focus on studying and continuing to get your degree.",
  "so you are feeling upset that he left you at parties, but your friends were not around to support you?",
  "i am so glad to hear it! i hope that you feel better soon!",
  "that is good that you are able to see a job.",
  "that is a very difficult situation to be in.",
  "oh, so you are feeling isolated and lonely because you are not finding anyone to talk to. is that correct?",
  "i think you should try to find some different ways to get away from the current situation.",
  "i can understand that. it's hard when you've been dealing with a lot of responsibility and you'll never be sure what to expect.",
  "it's ok. it'll be okay. it was nice to talk with you.",
  "that sounds like a great start. perhaps you could look into a gig organization that is not very well known. perhaps a local community college that you could join?",
  "i completely understand. i had a professor who held me accountable and i felt like i was not allowed to speak to him.",
  "how do you feel that they feel this way?",
  "ah, that sounds difficult. is that part of your job?",
  "it sounds like you have a good plan. i know you can do it.",
  "what seems to be the problem?",
  "thank you. i hope everything works out for you.",
  "what are you feeling isolated from?",
  "i had a friend who i knew at the time who was in the same boat as you, so i found out that it was a good way to get away from her.",
  "that is a great idea! i would love to be able to do freelance work too.",
  "i am doing well. merry christmas to you as well.",
  "i can imagine that would make you feel a bit anxious.",
  "no problem, you too!",
  "i think it'll be okay, as long as you stay safe. i know you are feeling bad about this situation, but i think you are doing your best to keep yourself safe.",
  "absolutely!",
  "i don think you should be afraid of generalization, i would rather trust myself than others.",
  "that is definitely a tough field to work in. it is also a very difficult time for you to keep track of what is going on in your life.",
  "that is a really difficult situation. do you have any other friends that you can talk to?",
  "you are very welcome. i hope i was able to be of some help.",
  "that sounds like a great idea. is there any other way to relieve stress?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. is there anything that you can do to distract yourself from the pandecrazees?",
  "i'm doing well. what has been going on?",
  "i have a daughter who does the same thing, she'll throw out a candy bar, but it's not my fault.",
  "maybe you should talk to a supervisor that would help you out, or maybe a supervisor who is able to help you with your issues as well.",
  "i hope you have a great time with your studies. i am sure you will do great.",
  "i can see how that can be stressful. i think you should talk to your boss and tell him that you are feeling stressed and need to talk to him about it.",
  "i've found that the study groups are really helpful when i'd like to go back to school. they give me more time to get my studying skills in order to get in the habit of studying.",
  "i understand. i was in a similar situation. i also felt like i was suffering and felt like a waste of time. i didn't think about it very much, but i tried to think about other things.",
  "bye",
  "how long were you together?",
  "i understand that you feel a bit down about the whole situation.",

  "i think you are doing great, you are making progress!",
  "you are welcome! i hope that you had a wonderful day too!",
  "what is the reason why you feel bad?",

  "that's great to hear! what has been bothering you?",
  "yes, it can be. but it is still a great place to share your feelings and feelings.",
  "that's right, we need to wait for the next couple of hours.",
  "it'll definitely help to talk about the situation and see if it helps.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "i can understand how you feel. i have had a similar situation in the past. i had a friend who was a student and she would be sad if she didn't get enough time to sociate.",
  "it is. i know it can help to get out and do something physical that makes you feel better.",
  "i hope that i have been able to give you some advice on the future.",
  "do you play soccer?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you been together?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. is there a job you want to go into?",
  "it works for everyone and it's not for all people",
  "i understand that. i have been in a similar situation and i know how hard it is",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. i am glad to hear you've been better.",
  "yes, i did. it was free and i found it to be a great way to ease my mind.",
  "i think that is the most important step. i know that you will be okay, but know it will make you feel better.",
  "do you feel that you might be vulnerable at this time of year?",
  "that's a very bad situation. it sounds like you have a lot of issues. what do you think you can do?",
  "you are welcome, i'll be here to listen and support you.",
  "perhaps you could try speaking with your supervisor? that way you are not worried about the boss'opinion.",
  "what's going on?",
  "i know it's hard, but you are doing your best to stay positive, i am sure.",
  "ok",
  "you too!",
  "i see it now.",
  "have you tried reaching out to her for help?",
  "thank you, i am glad you are feeling better. i hope you can get back on track soon.",
  "hi, how are you doing today?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. do you have any problems or concerns that you can help with?",
  "i hear you. there are some companies hiring right now that are offering online services to people who don't want to take on the extra work.",
  "have you tried getting friends to do guided lessons with you?",
  "i like playing call of duty, and playing bioshock.",
  "so you feel that your feelings are valid and that you would like to speak with them in a private setting?",
  "it sounds as though you are not doing enough to support yourself.",
  "she will! i bet she will be a great dog!",
  "i'm still trying to figure out what kinds of jobs i'd like to have in my field. i think it's important to make sure you have a good resume and are prepared for any future opportunities.",
  "i know it can be tough but i think it'll get better!",
  "i think you should try to take a day at a time and try to get some new things going.",
  "i have had to go through a similar situation. i had a great friend that i was able to talk to but i felt like i was useless.",
  "hello! how are you today?",
  "i am glad i could help, i am so glad i was able to help you today!",

  "merry christmas to you too!",
  "that is good that you are reaching out to the people who are trying to help you!",
  "that's understandable! i've been in a similar situation before, and it'll be ok to get used to it, but don'' t worry! it'sn't always possible to get over it. i think you should take care of yourself as much as you can!",
  "that sounds like a hard situation. did she pass away recently?",
  "hi, how are you today?",
  "you'r welcome. i wish you all the best.",
  "hello anna. i'd like to chat with you sometime?",
  "i think you should make sure that you can support her as well. i would suggest doing a lot of research online to find a group of people who have experience with this issue.",
  "i can tell that you are feeling really down. i think you should do some self care exercises.",
  "i know that is difficult and i know you will get through this. do your best to reach for help during this time.",
  "i understand that the task itself may be difficult, but once you start to work through it, it will become more manageable.",
  "if you feel anxious, you can always do it in person. that way you can have a better experience with the course.",
  "yes that is a good idea.",
  "hello",
  "i'm in my mid 40s and i see people with the same thing. it is common for people to feel that way.",
  "you could take a job that allows you to eat a banana and eat it?",
  "do you feel that you are trying to take advantage of the situation?",
  "i am glad i could be of some help. i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day!",
  "i am a little sad that we have to wait for the vaccine, but i am glad that you are still here.",
  "hi! how are you doing?",
  "yes, there are a lot of online groups you can join. i like to do yoga, i think that might help you to focus your mind on yourself and other things.",
  "that would be a good idea. it might make it easier to help him. i think it'll be easier to have a conversation with him about his alcohol issue than it is to have to talk to him about it.",
  "that is understandable, i can relate to that.",
  "i am good, thanks for asking. how are you doing today?",
  "i think that would be a great place to start. i love science fiction as well.",
  "that is a really good idea. i am glad you reached out for help.",
  "it seems as though you are worried that you may lose your son. does that sound right?",
  "i can understand how you feel.",
  "you are welcome. you should be proud of yourself for doing the best you can.",
  "i think you are doing the right thing by taking a different job, even though you might not get it all at once.",
  "you should try to make a plan for the meeting.",
  "i know that there are a lot of online resources that are available for free and are offering free lessons in many areas.",
  "i can understand how you are feeling, but i think we are all trying to make the best of this year. we have to be there for each other.",
  "so your boss is your boss and you feel obligate to stay?",
  "hello",
  "that is a really difficult situation. i can't imagine what you are going through.",
  "i would try to do one thing at a time and let it go naturally, i would make a list of things you can accomplish and then fill it with something else.",
  "a tlc is a video chat program where you can talk to people who have been in your situation",
  "is there anything that you could do to help you cope with the situation?",
  "what is your major?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. the first step in that process would be to get a psychiatrist to recommend something else to help with his job.",
  "what is your major?",
  "i see. that would make you feel a bit better. you could talk to your parents about it. they may be able to help you out.",
  "i understand that can be stressful. do you know how to make him respond?",
  "oh no, why are you feeling stressed?",
  "oh, i see. do you think you can get him to a doctor if he is experiencing a problem?",
  "i hope it all works out for you!",
  "i think you are a great woman for opening up and letting her know you are ready.",
  "if they believe you, then they're not going to believe you anyway.",
  "you can do this, it may help to take a deep breath and relax and take deep breaths.",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "great! i hope you enjoy your time at your new job and that you can find something else that will pay the bills.",
  "i am really sorry that you went through this. it is tough to see our children and our parents struggling and not knowing what to do. i know how difficult it must be to feel.",
  "i've had the same situation before, i went through a very similar situation in college. i made it through, but there was still a lot going on.",
  "i think that would be a great opportunity to pursue a career that will hopefully pay well.",
  "well, i hope you can see that it is a great way to gain some extra cash!",
  "i am doing a lot of stuff for my family and friends. i am also working on a list of things to make for my house and yard.",
  "i can see how frustrating that would be for you.",
  "what types of jobs would you like to work in? perhaps you could consider applying to places like food bank or an online call center.",
  "i know it can be hard to move on from a relationship but try to remember that you have a lot to look forward to in the future.",
  "that sounds really hard, i know it's hard to move away from your marriage. how do you feel about that?",
  "that sounds like fun!",
  "oh no, i am sorry to hear that. have you considered looking for new work?",
  "it sounds like you are being kind of a slump. i would definitely think that you're a bit anxious about it.",
  "i can see how it would be difficult for you. do you have any hobbyactivities that you enjoy?",
  "thanks! i am so happy to hear it.",
  "i hope you have a good day and thank for the chat!",

  "i understand, how can i help you?",
  "that's understandable, it's a difficult time to get through these feelings of anxiety.",
  "it is so hard to see the future but i know you can do it",
  "it's a great field to be in. i used to do it myself, but after a while, i started to get interested in other fields.",
  "i am sure you will find something soon.",
  "i would say that you should be careful about what you do, especially since the police have shown no real evidence that you are a criminal.",
  "i am a big fan of reading books and watching tv shows.",
  "that sounds like a really nice thing to have. i would say that it'd be good to get a dog if you could. do they help you feel better?",
  "bye : ) )",
  "oh no, that is terrible! i am so sorry you are going through this. how long has this been going on?",
  "yes that sounds like a great idea",
  "i think they would love that. i know that you are very kind and caring.",
  "i know it is hard to see someone else go through the same situation. but i know you can get through this!",
  "you can do it : d",
  "you as well!",
  "i understand that feeling. how long have you been working there?",
  "you are welcome!",
  "you're welcome.",
  "that'll be a great start. i'd suggest listening to a few podcasts podcasts, or maybe even just a book with a playlist.",
  "i see. how long ago was this?",
  "what would you like to talk about today?",
  "that is good, i would love to hear more about it.",
  "you're welcome!",

  "i can understand your fear, but tell your husband to tell someone",
  "i understand.. i live far from the city so i am scared too",
  "i am sorry to hear that.",
  "oh, well i am sorry to hear that. i know that it can be hard to find something you like, even if you're in the same situation as me.",
  "i understand that, but you can take the time to find a solution that will help you feel better. it is good to try to find the solution that you would like.",
  "you are very welcome. i wish you the best of luck in this difficult time.",
  "no problem, i wish you all the best with everything you do!",
  "it sounds like you're struggling with the fact that they aren't ready to speak with you.",
  "ok have a nice day",
  "i completely understand. it can be a very difficult time to be anonymous, but it'll be okay!",
  "i've also had to deal with a similar situation myself. i found that it was really hard for me to move on and it took a bit of time to find some peace and quiet.",
  "i've had my hair cut before. it was very stylish and i think it looks awesome!",
  "do you think you could make some new friends?",

  "i know how you feel. i went through something similar a few months ago and it was very difficult to be around someone who didn't understand how i was feeling. i started to have a lot of anxiety and worry about the future and then it got to be a bit worse.",
  "you are most welcome. i wish you all the best in finding a new job.",
  "i know it can be frustrating to feel alone in your feelings when you don't have many people you can connect with.",

  "i can understand how that can make you feel like this.",

  "that is a very tough situation. i know that you are going through a lot right now, but it is a good thing that you have been able to try this.",

  "hello, how are you today?",
  "that is good! it is always good to find ways to stay motivated.",
  "oh, i see. i am not close with my family either.",
  "i think you've done the best you can do. do you think it could be helpful to tell her that you feel you'd like to be closer with her, if that'd be possible?",
  "oh no. i am so sorry to hear that. what industry are you in?",
  "that is really hard to go through. have you talked to him about it?",
  "have you thought about reaching out with a friend to see if they can help you?",

  "you too!",
  "i have a couple of boys. i have been through a lot of stress in my life over the last couple years, but i know how much it can make you feel good to get some support from your family.",
  "i completely understand that feeling, i have been in a similar situation, but i've found a way to cope with it.",
  "do you feel like you have to keep pushing yourself?",
  "maybe you should let him know you feel sad and want to talk about it? do you think you would be able to communicate with him? or is that not possible?",
  "i am glad to hear that. is there anything specific you'd like to talk about today?",
  "i would definitely suggest reaching out for a tutor, it sounds like you have the best chance to learn and improve.",
  "do you have anyone you can talk to about it?",
  "you did not make her upset. you were mature enough to realize how much you were hurting.",
  "what did you do to make yourself feel better?",
  "it sounds to me like you are doing it wrong. you need a habit to be satisfied.",
  "it was very easy.",
  "what is going on?",
  "i see. so you are doing freelance work and you are not getting paid for it?",
  "it sounds that you are seeking comfort in knowing that there are some people that share these thoughts and feelings.",
  "oh wow. that's a lot of money. i'm sorry to hear that. have you talked to your parents about this?",
  "hi! how are you?",
  "i understand how you feel, i also lost my husband, and it was really hard on me. however, you are able to have a lot of energy, because you have kids, and you have a great support system to support your life. you are a strong person.",
  "hello how are you feeling today?",
  "i think you should talk to the upper manager and let them know how you feel about it. they can really help.",
  "i think that if he is that interested in politics, he will keep on being a trump supporter.",
  "i understand. it'd be better if you had stayed with him and had no feelings for him.",
  "i know that it can be really hard to do.",
  "i understand, but it can be very difficult to get into a long term relationship when you feel like you don'' t know anyone else.",
  "you can also try to reach out to friends and family who are close to you, or ask them if they have any suggestions you could give. i know you might be able to find some helpful information out in person.",
  "what do you think might be a good way to earn money in the future?",
  "that'd be a great start. i hope that it goes well for you.",

  "you'll have a great year!",
  "i wish you the best of luck!",

  "oh i see. so you're basically stuck with a bunch of people that are not in your life?",
  "i know how you feel.",
  "so they're avoiding you because of the phone calls? do they not want you to see them?",
  "i understand how you feel. i have had a similar situation with my brother, when he was away for a year, i felt like he was always being manipultive and i was afraid i would get hurt. i would tell him i was fighting and that i would not want to be with him anymore.",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. i have had a similar experience with my daughter. i've tried to work through the feelings, but it takes a lot of time.",
  "that is a tough one. it is a good thing that you chose a future experience that you were able to use to help you study.",
  "it sounds like you are making a good effort to get outside of the church. i have found that that if i do my best and have faith in god, i can make it through.",
  "i've been in similar situation myself and it helps to take some time off to look into other options.",
  "that does sound like a very difficult situation, especially since you've got so much going on at once.",
  "how can i help you?",
  "you are very welcome. have a wonderful day!",
  "when we get kids out of bed, we usually enjoy a good book and a movie",
  "i'd say it'll be okay, just take care of yourself.",

  "yes, i hope you have a good day and stay strong",
  "good afternoon, how may we assist you. how can i assist yourself?",
  "i think you will be okay, you have some great ideas and i believe you can do it!",
  "if he is a good friend then he should understand why you did not want to go",
  "i'll be waiting for you to let me know what you think.",

  "i completely understand. i would definitely do the same.",

  "ah i see. well, i know that you can'' t just go anywhere and not get a vaccine, but you could look into a local program that will offer free vaccines, such as the one you are training for. i know a lot of people who are having trouble finding a private tutor. have you looked into that?",
  "are you interested in getting a degree in the business development field?",
  "i have also had people that were just like my friend, that were very toxic. i just did not allow them to be. i made sure i was wearing my mask so i wouldn't be exposed to the virus. i also had to wear my mask for safety, so i don ; t have to wear mine.",
