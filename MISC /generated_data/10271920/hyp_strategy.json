  "i think that it would be good to speak with a professional about how to help you out. you are already a student so you can do it and see how much you can help. perhaps you could also try to get a tutor to help with your classes or maybe even a tutor advisor to help",

  "oh no! i can totally understand. i've had to do that in the past.",
  "that's not good, you should try to find a new job.",
  "i understand that. i have had my fair share of relationships end because of covid.",
  "i can understand how you feel. i've had friends who have been in that situation and it is really hard to deal with it",
  "i see. i am sure you will do great.",
  "i would suggest doing that.",
  "what do you think is the reason?",
  "you're welcome! have a great rest of your day!",
  "i can understand how you feel. it is a difficult time for everyone in this situation.",
  "i'd suggest starting with a few of them, but if you really want to, you can always start with one. just a few minutes at a time. if you want something more, then i suggest trying to find something you really like to do!",

  "you too.",
  "i can understand why you would feel that way. it sounds like you are trying to be positive about yourself and i know how that is going to be going for you.",
  "that is a really good idea. i would definitely do that too.",
  "i am not sure how to feel about that. i know you can get through it!",
  "i have been in a similar situation myself. i had a friend who was very close to me.",

  "i am sorry to hear that. i have been through the same thing and i feel you on that.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i can understand how you feel.",
  "i would try to do what you can to make yourself feel better. that is something that will help you feel better about yourself.",
  "that's a great idea. what would be the best way to get through this?",
  "oh no! that'd be a huge shame! that must make you feel really sad!",
  "i think you should try to make some progress to get out of this funk",
  "i hope you have a wonderful day and hope you get to spend it with your family.",
  "you can try to get some help. i would recommend reaching out to friends and family to see if they are comfortable with your concerns.",
  "it's not a problem at all!",
  "i understand, it seems like you are feeling a lot of pressure to do your job and you are not being honest with yourself.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i've been through similar things myself. i had to deal with a lot of anxiety when i was younger. it was really difficult.",

  "i've been there. it's so hard.",
  "hi there, how are you doing?",
  "you can contact me directly and i can help you with anything.",

  "i am sure you are very anxious about this. i can understand how that can be stressful.",
  "i hope i have been able to help you.",
  "you too!",
  "well, you said it yourself that you have trouble trusting people to help you, so i would say that you are not ready to trust people.",
  "i'd definitely give it a try.",
  "i think that it is best to find a way to deal with the situation.",
  "what sort of things have you done that you feel you are supposed to do?",
  "hello. how are things with you today?",
  "how are you feeling now?",
  "it seems that you are in the best shape of your life for finding a job. that is great!",

  "i've been there. it'll take time. have you tried doing any exercise?",

  "hello, how are you today?",
  "have you tried any other things besides mindfulness?",
  "i think if you try to work it out with your friends, they will understand.",
  "i understand that feeling. i would also think that the covid has to do with the virus or other issues that are going on right now.",

  "i am sure that is a tough situation to be in, but you can do it!",
  "i have had a few friends who are struggling with depression and anxiety too. it really helps to talk to people about it.",
  "i see. you are a student, so you are not working with anyone else. how about you take some time off?",
  "i understand how that feels.",
  "i have been in that position before. i am sorry you had to go through that. i wish you all the best in the future.",

  "what do you think about it?",
  "i am really sorry that happened. do you have any family who could help you with the situation?",

  "i have been there, and it is so hard, but you will be okay.",
  "it'll probably be hard to get back into the dating game if you have no other friends. i know it'd be hard.",
  "it sounds like you're worried about the pandemic, and you've not been able to talk to your friends or family about it.",
  "well, i'd suggest taking a few deep breaths and meditating to relax. it will help you feel better.",
  "have you tried to talk to your family members about the situation?",
  "thank you, i wish you all the best!",
  "that sounds like a good plan. it may help you find something you really enjoy doing, and make you more motivated to do it.",
  "that sounds like a lot to deal with.",
  "i know how you feel. do you have a friend or family member you can talk to about it about your situation?",
  "hello, how are things?",
  "oh, i see. so you feel that you are not being as effective as you thought?",
  "how long have you been working as a manager?",
  "i know it's hard, but i think it would be worth it. it'll help you to realize that you're being unfaithful to your girlfriend.",

  "it is not healthy to have pets, especially one that is not your own.",
  "i know it can be hard for you to deal with the stress of finding a new job, but there are a lot of online jobs available for free.",
  "i'm sure that you have had a lot of bad relationships before, and i've been there as well. have you been able to talk to anyone about it?",

  "i understand how hard it can be to feel like you've been lied to.",
  "what else would i suggest?",

  "what do you mean by that?",

  "i understand, the last time i had a job was back in december.",
  "what is causing you to feel that way?",

  "it seems like you're taking a lot of care of yourself. how can you help yourself?",
  "is there anything you'd like to talk about?",
  "i see, you are frustrated with her behavior?",
  "it's not about the outcome, it'll just be about the fact that the other party doesn't respect you.",
  "i understand how you feel. i had a break up with my ex a few months ago and it really hurt.",
  "i've been through similar things. i'll say that i had a similar situation once. i was in a class that was very close to my finals, but i didn't want to be in a hurry to graduate.",

  "that is a good idea!",
  "hello. how are you doing today?",
  "i'd suggest getting some support from your local government.",

  "i'm glad that i could be of some assistance! i hope you have a wonderful day!",
  "i am so happy to hear that you are doing well!",
  "i know it's hard to find someone to spend time with, but it'll be worth it. i would suggest talking to your loved ones about this.",
  "do you feel that you are not being treated fairly by your spouse?",
  "oh i see. i didn'ts seem like you were trying to talk to him about his issues, but i can understand why you're feeling that way.",
  "i am glad to hear it. i hope you will be able to find a new job soon.",

  "i am sorry you are struggling. what is your issue with your job?",
  "that's a really tough situation, but i think you are going to be fine!",
  "i would be very afraid to say that, but you should give him a call or text and explain the situation.",

  "i can relate to that.",
  "hello, how are you doing?",
  "i am sure that will be great for your mental health.",

  "i'm sorry to hear that. what's been bothering you the most?",

  "it sounds like you are doing well. i know it will be hard, but you can do it.",
  "i know it can be difficult to find new work right now, but i believe you can get through this!",
  "yes, i feel that. you can't let the emotions of losing a pet get you down. i think that you should talk to your dog and make sure that he is not the one that you want to lose. i know that is hard.",
  "yes, you can do it. i think you are just as healthy as a person if not healthier.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have you tried talking to your friends about it?",

  "what type of work are you looking for?",
  "how about talking to your doctor about this issue?",
  "hi there, how are ya today?",
  "i think that you should try to make her understand that you don'ts want to be in the same situation as she does. it will help you get over your feelings.",
  "i am happy to hear that! i also have been in a similar situation before.",
  "i have been in a similar situation before, but it was better when i had a better partner. i know how hard that can be, but i think that if you can get through it, then you will be able to move forward in life.",
  "i know, that is the worst. i'd recommend you take a step back and try to focus on something else that you enjoy doing.",

  "oh wow, that's a lot of work.",
  "it's a great idea! i hope you can find something that you can enjoy.",
  "i think that you should start with the first step. it will take time, but it will come. i wish you all the best!",
  "i think you should try to talk to your friends and family about this, and see if they are comfortable with it.",
  "oh my goodness! i can't imagine how painful it must be for you to have to deal with that. that must be incredibly difficult, especially when you have been trying so hard to keep yourself busy.",
  "it sounds like you have a great plan. what seems to be the cause of your depression?",
  "i can see how that would be stressful.",
  "i'm glad i was able to help!",
  "i know it is tough, but you are being honest and not giving yourself the wrong answers.",
  "i understand your concern. the fact that you have not done anything yet does not seem to be helping at all.",
  "what do you think you will do?",
  "oh no! that's a very serious situation that i can understand. have you tried to talk to her about it?",
  "how may i help you today?",
  "i've been through a lot of that, especially since covid was started.",
  "do you have any other hobbies?",
  "oh i see, sorry to hear that. did she say anything about that?",

  "you can also try talking to your teachers about how to address the situation. maybe it will help you feel better about what you are doing.",
  "what is going on?",
  "i can understand why you feel that way. i am also in a similar situation. it is hard to feel happy when someone else is making a choice.",
  "i am glad to hear that. i hope you are feeling better about yourself and want to talk to someone about it.",
  "i think you have a good idea.",
  "yes, i understand. i also have been in that position and have learned that there is a lot of pressure to do the same. i think it is important that you learn how to do both.",
  "so you have a lot of experience with the subject? i would suggest looking into the professor's side as well.",
  "you are welcome.",
  "i understand your feelings, however i think you will be fine",
  "oh i am so sorry to here that. have a good rest of your day!",
  "you should be able to see if there are any other people in the house that could help.",

  "i would recommend taking a walk or walking to relax. that can be helpful.",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "i have been in a similar situation before, and i felt bad for both of us. it's important to be able to understand the reasons behind why you were upset and why you're upset.",
  "yes i know it can be hard for people to feel comfortable in their own home.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, how can i help?",
  "i'd suggest a google search for the local resources that you can search for online. there are some great resources out there. have you tried searching for local businesses?",
  "you are welcome. i hope you are able to move on from this and find a new job.",
  "it sounds like you are trying to make yourself more successful, and you are working hard to make that happen.",

  "it sounds like you have a lot of people that you could talk to about your feelings.",
  "if you say so, then you can end the conversation",
  "i am sorry to hear that, can you explain more about the situation?",
  "i have heard that having a good sleep can help with that.",
  "i would suggest trying to get your parents involved in a group call, call them, or even a call and tell them that you have a support system.",
  "what seems to be the cause of your depression?",
  "i think that is a good idea. it would help if you could talk to her and see what is going on.",

  "do you think she's not going to be able to move on with life?",

  "i can understand that. i also had to work for a financial firm.",
  "that's unfortunate. how long have you been together?",

  "do you have any family or friends that could help with that?",
  "what do you think is causing the depression?",
  "i would suggest you try to find a new hobby. if you do not have one right now, then you could look for a new job. there are so many online dating websites, there are also many groups out there that offer advice on how to meet new people.",
