  "just think positive about yourself and you will be much better off",
  "i understand that. have you asked your friends if they want to talk about your face?",
  "what do you do for a living?",

  "that is good that you have a solution. however, i think it is important that you take the appropriate steps to help her.",
  "well, there are plenty of people in this situation that don't want to do anything wrong, and if your partner doesn t care about that, then you don'thing you need to do a lot more than just share your feelings with them.",
  "that sounds like a really great major! you are on top of things!",
  "if it makes you feel any better i think it will help you feel better in the long run.",

  "i'm sorry to hear that. i know it can be a stressful time for you.",
  "i'll be honest, i'd rather be doing something relaxing or calming than looking at the bright side of the sun, but i'v tried it and it doesn't work. i just try to focus on my breathing and focus my focus on the moment that'll bring me joy. i try to practice it a lot. it helps me to get a sense of how the moment has been affected and how i'l feel when i try it. it seems like you're doing something that'd help with your anxiety.",
  "don't do that, do something else",
  "you are welcome.",
  "you are doing your best, and i am sure he will get good grades",

  "you are feeling rejected and hurt by this.",
  "i'm sure you will be fine! i think you can do this!",
  "yes i have. we talked about it and she said she is not sure what to do about the pandemic.",
  "i can understand why he would do that..",
  "i think that would be a good idea. i think you should make him feel better about himself.",
  "if he doesn't, then you should just tell him that you're feeling depressed.",
  "i have heard it is a great game but i am not sure what the reason for the switch is",
  "i understand. so you are struggling with them because you are not good enough to do them?",
  "i just kept thinking about the things that are bothering me and how i need to talk about them.",

  "i would tell them you are worried about them and they might not want to help you",
  "you're welcome. i hope you feel better soon.",
  "well i would start with asking them if they want to talk to you about this and then go from there.",
  "why is it not a great time for you?",
  "i also have been doing something different since then. i have made a lot of money and i have had a lot more fun.",
  "you are very welcome, i hope you can achieve your goal in the next few days!",
  "that sounds really hard. have you tried to talk to your parents about this issue?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. sometimes it helps to talk to friends and try to get to know them better. i have been in your shoes before. it was hard to talk about friends and relationships.",
  "i would suggest going to a job search group and joining their group.",

  "what is making you feel this way?",
  "i am good. how are you doing today?",
  "i can see why that would remind you of him, you are a great student and he should be proud of you!",
  "if you have to speak with them, it may be best to take the time to reflect on the situation.",
  "well, there are plenty of opportunities to make ends meet. maybe you could try looking for online jobs while you're in school?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. would you like to talk about it?",
  "i have been in a similar situation. i tried to just talk to my family and see what they think and it helped me.",
  "yes it would be hard but i would be willing to give it a try.",
  "i would be too! i have been cheated on myself before. i would not forgive him because it was my mistake.",
  "i think you should definitely continue to care about him and try not to feel like you're being taken advantage of.",
  "yes, i think that would be a great start.",
  "that is a very rough thing to be through. i've been in that situation myself and know how you feel.",
  "how are you today?",
  "yeah, she should be able to help.",
  "it sounds like a great plan. you could even try getting a job that involves a lot of work. it would be good to get your degree too.",
  "yes, it can be very helpful to talk to a student about this.",
  "that is a great idea!",

  "that'll be hard, but you can get another job if you try hard. i am sure you will find one.",
  "i totally understand. i also have been in a similar situation in my life. it took years to get over the negative feelings that i felt.",
  "if you think you are being too harsh on yourself, then you can use this opportunity to reflect on how you were treated by your friends and family.",

  "i don t have a routine, but i've found that my daily routine has gotten a little bit more intense.",
  "i am doing well, thanks for asking. what is bothering you today?",
  "i think it'll be hard to make any friends if you're not going to be able to keep any of your friends close to you. i think you should try talking to them and see if they understand how you are feeling.",
  "you are not alone in feeling that way. it sounds like you need to talk to him about it.",
  "i understand how you feel. i had the same situation once, i was a student and my friends were not around. i ended up having to cut them off after a few days. it took me a while to figure out how to make plans.",

  "what is your problem?",
  "you are welcome, i wish you all the best in the future!",
  "i've had a similar situation, and it wasn't disrespectful at all! i can tell you that if you don'; t want to see her, you'll want to be more concerned about her, and not be as worried about her behavior. you have to make the right decision and make the most of it.",
  "i think that would be a great idea. you will feel much better when you have a dog and not worry about your feelings. it is better to have a new hobby to enjoy yourself.",

  "so you saw her chat history?",
  "i see. is there anyone who can help you with this?",

  "you are very welcome!",
  "i was not ready to go.",
  "do you have any other problems with your health that you can talk to someone about?",
  "yes. i find that i get less stressed if i get a little bit of exercise.",
  "i can do that",
  "that's very frustrating. is there a reason why?",
  "i hope that i have helped you a bit.",
  "i think that it would be helpful to have a chat with you first. it would help you to communicate and communicate with your relationship.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have you tried reaching out to people for support?",
  "how are you feeling now?",
  "are you married?",
  "have you considered finding a counselling?",

  "so it has been a very long time for you to be treated fairly.",
  "you too!! : )",
  "you are welcome. i am glad i could help. you are doing great.",
  "that is understandable. how long have you known them since elementary school?",
  "yes, you could try setting a small goal. setting your daily routine to one hour a day can help with the concentration.",
  "i think that is a great idea and i am sure you will find a way to overcome this.",
  "i can understand that you are anxious about losing your job. i have also felt this way before.",
  "i understand. do you think it would be worth it to talk to them and ask if they want to talk?",

  "i'm sorry to hear that.. i also live in a city and i find walking to be very peaceful.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "i hope that i have been able to be of some help to you. i know this has been very hard for us and i can only imagine how much you must feel.",
  "i think you are doing your best to support your family and make sure you stay positive.",
  "i understand. i also enjoy talking with others about my concerns. it is a great way to connect with others.",
  "it sounds as though you have been through something very similar. do you think this has anything to do with him?",
  "i hope you have a good night",
  "i am in georgia",
  "hello. how are you?",
  "that's good that you were able to see them with your friend and try to make it work.",
  "haha : ) i hope you're not getting into politics too much : ) but anyway i hope the chat is going well",

  "i'll be happy to listen to anything that you need to talk about",
  "i understand that it is difficult for you to get on with women. do you want to tell me more about yourself?",
  "i am sure you will be able to get unemployment as well",
  "it'll be okay. i know it'd be hard to move forward with a partner that has cheated on you.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, please try to reach out to him.",
  "that is completely understandable. do you have any friends or family you could talk to about it?",
  "yes you can. do you have any other kids?",
  "i think if he'll be comfortable with the idea of using sites, you can just sit down and tell him how you don't like the idea.",
  "have you talked to your school about this?",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. it must be hard when you have someone who is so close to you.",
  "what about taking another class?",
  "yes, i think that would be a great idea.",
  "i hope it will be helpful for you.",
  "you should not feel guilty for not seeing him.",
  "it sounds like you have a lot going on in your life right now, it sounds as though you are worried that something will go wrong with your finances",
  "how long have you had it?",
  "what are you struggling with?",
  "i understand, sometimes life is very overwhelming. i am glad to hear you are feeling better.",
  "i think it will help if they continue to harass you. you can also get a copy of the letter and mail it in the mail.",
  "i would suggest that you do not take any action to bring about the frustration. you are making the right choices and doing them safely.",
  "i know it is frustrating, but you can get through this.",
  "i'm sorry to here that. i've been in your shoes and know how hard it is to be laid off. i think you can do it.",
  "i know that you have been feeling stressed lately and i'm sure that you can make it through this.",

  "sleep is a good thing and you are welcome",
  "you too!",
  "hi, i am here to listen. what seems to be the problem?",
  "good luck with your son's school plans as well!",
  "i've been struggling with that as well. i don't have any work right now, but i know that i'll be able to get back into it.",
  "i hope i have been able to be of some help!",
  "hi, how are you doing today?",
  "well i can understand that. but i have found it helps to talk to others who are also struggling with the same things.",
  "goodbye!",
  "i see, so you have been experiencing this since before you were born?",
  "and just remember to be there for you and support when you need to.",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "i have also suffered from anxiety before. i think talking to a doctor about this might be a good idea!",
  "that is understandable. communication is key to a healthy relationship.",
  "what sort of therapist do you have?",
  "that's a great idea!",
  "i can understand that. i have also heard that there is a program that helps people with alcohol addiction.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "if she doesn't then she will not fail you.",
  "i think that's what we all need. just keep trying and keep working on!",
  "hello. how are you today?",
  "of course i hope i have helped",
  "yes, i have seen a movie that would be perfect for you to watch.",
  "i had fun, but the loneliness hit me hard. i felt alone for a while and felt like it wasn't worth the effort.",
  "that is a good question. i would say it does not help to be tired all day. have you tried any exercise?",
  "i am sure you will find someone! i think you should start trying other things in order to find your next partner.",
  "you are very welcome",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what are you doing for a living that you do not feel motivated?",
  "what is going on?",
  "i'm sure it will be a great day for you!",
  "i've been there too. it'll be okay!",
  "i understand. but i do believe that you can take it on.",
  "i also believe that we should stay focused on the important parts of our lives, and that we will get there in no time.",
  "i can understand how you feel. i also have felt this way before, and it is very hard.",
  "do you have any other friends or family that you can talk to about this?",
  "do you feel that this is contributing to the problem?",
  "ok, so you don'; t want stability or a highlevel job. so what you'll find is that you've got a good edge over senior employees.",
  "i think it would be a great start to address the issue and see if he can change his mind. if he doesn't change his minds, maybe you can find a way to get him to reflect on the situation and see how he reacts to it. sometimes it helps to find ways to address his current position.",
  "i feel you my friend. i have been with a girl since march of 2017 and i still have a lot of time to myself.",
  "you are welcome. you need more help in your business than you know.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, that sounds like a rough time.",
  "i have found that if i make a list of things that i like to do, i get a better chance at finding something.",
  "i'm good, thanks.",
  "of course! i think it would help a lot.",
  "great! i wish you all the best!",
  "i think that your daughter is a great person for taking a path forward that she enjoys and learning from it. i believe she will find a great job with this.",
  "so you're trying to put money in as much as possible?",
  "okay. i am sorry. so you are looking for job right now?",

  "i am so sorry to hear that. would you like to talk about it?",
  "i understand how that can be scary for you",
  "i am very happy to hear that. it is a really tough time for everyone right now.",
  "have you tried dating a new man before?",
  "that is great!",
  "what are you doing to feel better about this?",
  "how are you doing?",
  "you're welcome! i hope i have been able to help you today.",
  "i think it's important to have a plan in place for the future. i also think yoga can help you stay motivated.",
  "if you feel like you're not working enough, you can take the time to find another job. i suggest you do something you enjoy.",
  "you are welcome. i hope i have been able to help you",
  "hello. how are you today?",
  "i understand your anxiety about that. i have been in that situation myself. it's hard to not have money but i know you can make a living off of it.",

  "i can understand that. i have a hard time being a parent too. it seems like you are both struggling financially right now and i don t know how you can get through this!",
  "i've been in school for almost three years now. i think that'll be a good year to get back into the game of life.",
  "yes, but you can try to find something that you enjoy doing, like taking a walk, or listening to a podcast. that way you have something to keep yourself busy, and you can get your mind off of things.",
  "i think you are doing very well.",
  "i'm doing well. what's on your mind?",
  "i have had some good memories when i was younger. i found that it helps to remember those good times.",
  "you too and take care",

  "i am glad i could help.",
  "what are some things that help you stay awake?",
  "yes, it'd be a great first step and one that will really help you get back to your feet.",
  "i think you are doing the right thing by taking a break from the computer.",
  "that is a really hard situation to be in right now. i am sure you are feeling a lot better now.",

  "how are you?",
  "oh wow, that is so bad. i'd be freaking out too!",

  "i hope that i have been able to be of some help.",
  "i am glad i could be of some help. i hope that you are feeling better and feeling a bit more relaxed now.",

  "have you tried talking to him directly about it?",
  "you too!",
  "you're welcome. i hope things get better for you.",
  "that is a very hard thing to go through. are there any hobbies that you enjoy doing that you'd like to do that might help you get back to where you were?",
  "oh no, that's a really hard thing to not be able to see straight! is there something that'd make you feel better about that?",
  "i can tell that you are trying to make your life better, and that is wonderful!",
  "ah, i see. it must be hard for you to be working so hard during the holidays.",
  "i think that would be a great way to get some closure. i think it would be best for both of you to do this, even if he doesn t respond to you first.",
  "i've been there, it's very hard. do you have any idea what happened?",
  "i am sorry you are going through this.",
  "i've been having some problems with my immune system too, i'm hoping to find a way to get my meds back soon",

  "i had a similar issue with my son. i had to use the smallest tasks i could get him to do, but later he learned to not let anything bother him.",
  "i can understand how you feel. losing a loved one can be a very difficult thing to go through.",
  "i also have found a lot of resources online and on google. i also started using a local group called the homeless shelter. they are very helpful.",
  "i am sure you are feeling stressed about this right now.",

  "what are some of your abilities that you'd like to improve?",
  "i've been through something like that myself, and i can tell you it was really frustrating.",

  "i would suggest taking a few deep breaths and then slowly breathe in a few minutes before going to work. i would also try to focus on your work.",
  "i can understand that. i have been in a similar situation. i've been in your shoes. i was also in a very similar situation when i was in your position. i didn't have the time to prepare for the worst and it was a huge stressor.",
  "what type of work are you currently in?",
  "you're welcome. i hope you feel better after this conversation.",

  "hello, how are you today?",

  "just keep going!",

  "oh i see. i'd definitely be upset too.",
  "i hope that it will help you.",
  "i think you should be able to handle this situation with your children. have you considered seeing a therapist or going to someone like that?",

  "i am sorry to hear that. you seem to be a great employee and your new job is a great opportunity to improve.",

  "i think that's the right attitude to take. you don'tknow what you want to do until you try.",
  "i've been in similar situations before. it can be really stressful. i'd say just ignore them and try to move on from it.",
  "bye",

  "okay, i understand that you feel like this but i think you should tell your friends that you are not comfortable with the situation",
  "yes! i love to play the lottery and play video games. i also enjoy reading. do you have any hobbybooks or other hobbsrelated activities you can recommend?",
  "have you considered talking to your girlfriend about this?",
  "i hope you have a wonderful holiday and good luck.",
  "i know you can do it!",
  "i have faith that this will help to ease things. i know i have been in situations like this. i have had to learn to just stay focused on the positives.",
  "i understand that feeling. it's tough to see people and see them for so long.",
  "that sounds very hard. i have had it myself. it was scary. i think i was just being a baby. i didn't have any physical symptoms at the time.",
  "that sounds very bad. i can understand why they're upset.",
  "you are welcome. i hope you can get a better support system out there.",

  "do you have a job?",
  "have you talked to your parents about this?",
  "you too!",
  "i'm doing well, how can i help you today?",
  "i can understand that. i have been in a similar position before and it was very difficult for me to adjust to the new situation.",
  "i'm doing well, thank you for asking! how can i help you today?",

  "yes i am an employee. i am also a software development worker.",
  "oh wow, that's awesome! i hope everything works out for you in the end!",
  "i can see how that would be hard for you. i had a friend pass away a few months ago and it was hard for me too but i had to do it.",
  "well, i know that there are many different ways to cope with the situation. i am an american, so i know it can be hard. but i know there are ways to connect and keep your mind off things.",
  "how are you feeling today?",

  "yes, it sounds like that'll be a very good thing to do. i think it'll help you to have some confidence in yourself!",
  "if it's affecting your job, it should be easy to figure out.",
  "yes i can relate to that. i think that is why i find myself in a bad place during these times.",
  "yes, that is good. i had the same experience. i talked to the company about the possibility of moving up and they did not want to let me go.",
  "i did not see any way to expedite it, unfortunately. i did see a lawyer though, and they were able to provide me with a list of legal aid.",
  "hello! how are you doing today?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. did you switch careers for a job you wanted to do?",
  "i see. well, there are a few online groups that allow people to meet new people. have you tried any of those?",
  "i understand that you are stressed and struggling to find work. what kind of job do you have?",
  "so, the company you are currently applying for is not offering you a promotion?",

  "i wish you the best of luck!",
  "you are welcome, have a nice day!",
  "it's important to remember that we all have our moods and we have every right to be upset with them.",
  "oh wow, i am so sorry! i hope that is something that you can find out about yourself.",
  "have you talked to your boss about this?",
  "i am not sure if those have any effect on sleep. i am sure they do though!",
  "i'm doing well too, thank you for asking! how are you doing?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that.",
  "have you tried to talk to your friends about this? they can help you find a new job.",
  "no problem, i hope you have a great day!",
  "i know it's hard, but just remember you've got this. i know you can do it!",
  "i've been in a similar situation myself. i always feel bad for the people who don't do their work and just get the worst result. it feels like we're being underpaid.",
  "sounds like a good plan!",

  "i am doing well. thanks for asking. how can i help you today?",
  "hi there. how are you today?",
  "i understand. i have a lot of anxiety about it as well.",
  "what is the job?",
  "i've been in a similar situation myself and it really does make you feel bad.",
  "that's good that he will definitely be out for two months.",
  "it's definitely not something i want to do.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have you tried any job search yet?",
  "i understand. i would recommend a journal with a list of thoughts and thoughts to keep you busy and away from groups.",
  "i hope it works out for you. i've been in a similar situation before where i ended the friendship with someone and it's been really difficult.",
  "i would ask her to explain that you don'; t want her to get mad. you said you don t want your coworker to get into trouble, and it'd be better if she did. do you want her on your team?",
  "it sounds like you are a very caring person. i think it is worth taking a step back and letting her know how you are feeling. she may not even realize how much you are hurting.",
  "it is silly and very hurtful, but you have a right to talk to her.",
  "you're welcome.",
  "corgi is a great dog. i've also had a jack and he was smart! i also had two pyrenees. they are a great little company dog.",

  "so you want to be friends but she doesn't want to do it?",
  "wow. that is a very demanding thing for her. have you tried to talk to her about it at all?",
  "yes, people should not hide when confronted. they should be able to understand why you feel this way.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, what are you sad about?",
  "oh no, i am so sorry. i can understand how you feel. i've had to do something similar in the past. it really sucks.",
  "i can relate to that, i have also struggled with depression for a long time and it helps to think about all the good things we can do.",
  "if you think about it, it'll be even harder for you to get paid more for your work, so you can't really do anything else.",
  "i think that would be a good idea. you don'thing it would hurt you to be isolating them?",
  "are you working during the holidays?",
  "so you want the one that is most important to you and that takes time away from your dad.",
  "i am not a real one but i am trying to make things easier for myself.",
  "i run when i feel stressed. running can be a great way to relieve some stress. have you tried that?",
  "do you think that it would take a long time to be able to be with him?",
  "i can understand how that is hard to deal with. have you tried any ways to help yourself?",
  "i'm doing well, thanks for asking. is there anything you'd like to talk about?",
  "i know you are feeling low but i can provide you with some support",
  "that is a tough situation. it seems like you are struggling with your kids.",
  "i think you are a very mature and good person. this has been a very hard time for you. you are not old enough to have a relationship. you should try to start again. i know this is a tough time, but i think it will help you to find the peace of mind.",

  "i've been in a similar situation before and it can be really hard to change someone's mind when you are feeling down.",
  "have you ever tried talking to a therapist? they can help a lot of people and really help.",
  "i'm good, what's going on?",
  "you are not alone in feeling this way. i also have lost my employment before and it really sucks.",
  "i know it is hard to confront people, but you can at least try to talk to them.",
  "i think that would be a great way to help with that!",
  "i can definitely see how that's a hard time to put aside a lot of money for your daughter. i've been there myself and it's been hard. but it sounds like you've already made a plan for what you can do to help your daughter get through this.",
  "i see, so your friend ignored you because she didn't like you.",
  "how can i help you?",
  "how are you feeling about them?",
  "yeah i totally understand.",
  "what are you doing?",
  "of course! i hope this helps!",
  "that'd make sense. have you spoken to him about it or have you talked to him for a while about it, if that'sstill possible?",

  "meditating can be really helpful!",
  "i hope it helps!",
  "what about a local church? there are many that have been open to new members in the church.",
  "i hope that it does! i really enjoy talking to you too!",
  "you're welcome!",
  "how long were you guys together?",
  "i can completely understand your worry. i have been in the same situation before and was not able to financially support my mother.",
  "there are plenty of online jobs that you can apply for that you would be comfortable with, and you might find something you like to do in the future.",
  "how may i assist you?",

  "i can understand your frustration and i know how hard it must be.",

  "you too!",
  "wrap up sounds great!",
  "so you would like to change your job if you have a chance?",
  "i use the mts scripts that are available on chrome and the forum websites. they will give me a list of hits that i can hit and then i can just click them and see how much they are worth. it takes a few minutes to get them done, but i've found them very helpful when i'm looking for hits.",
  "i understand, do you think you can talk to her about this?",
  "if you're struggling with choosing between those two then you should just look at your options.",

  "you are in a tough spot right now, but you are doing your best.",

  "what's making you anxious?",
  "i'm glad to hear you're starting to find things to help you. i hope that helps.",
  "yes i can understand that. i also have spoken to my therapist about my fear of crowds and that helped me a lot.",

  "i believe in you!",
  "i have been there myself and i know it can be very hard. it'll take time to get over the negative thoughts and try to take some deep breaths and just try to focus on the positive. i believe you can too!",
  "i think that is a great idea. i would try to focus on what is on you first and foremost.",
  "what's going on in your life that's making you feel so overwhelmed?",
  "i've been in a similar situation before. i used to be in a family home as well. i found that it's helpful to have something to do during these times, too.",
  "you are not doing very hot then",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have you tried talking to him about it?",
  "yes i think so too. i'm glad that you are doing research and it sounds like you are trying to find some relief from this situation.",

  "that sounds really frustrating. i am sure that it was very difficult for you.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that.",
  "i'm sorry to hear you have to go through this. it is hard to get through a loss like that.",
  "i think its a good idea to get one and see if you need more.",
  "you are welcome.",
  "yes it's an app for people who are in a committed relationship.",
  "i am glad you are feeling better now. you can do it too!",
  "have you tried meditating or taking any sort of selfsleep medication?",
  "i understand. i've been through similar situations myself. i can understand how it feels to be in this situation. it'll take time, but you will find someone, and even if you don't you will still feel strong.",
  "i'd recommend talking to your friends and family about the breakup. they can give you some good advice.",

  "do you have any friends who could help out with assistance?",
  "i'm doing well. what can i help you with today?",
  "yeah, that can be frustrating. i would be nervous too.",
  "i can understand that. i went through something similar in my late 20's. i had to take a lot of breaks from work to focus on my family.",
  "i see, so you feel that they are not as supportive as they should be?",
  "that is the important part of being a good friend.",
  "i would suggest something you like to do when you are not doing well at home. maybe reading, playing video games, or going out with friends.",
  "it is always good to get some exercise. i usually just take a walk, but it can also be a great way to make a difference.",

  "i hear you! i had a son and he was independent as well. i had to take him for walks with me.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that you lost your job.",
  "perhaps you could consider a local gig worker position, perhaps even an online tutor or tutor, who may be willing to help you with your work. perhaps you can start a family with some children. perhaps they would like to have you teach them a lesson or two.",
  "do you think it's possible to talk to her about it?",
  "have you tried to talk to your friends and see if they would like to open up to you about this issue?",

  "i would say just start doing your work and see what happens. it may be a bit of a struggle, but it may work out for you. you could also try to find a new position to work in and see if it is better suited to you, since it is more competitive.",
  "you too.",
  "what do you like to do?",
  "you are welcome",
  "i understand. i have been in situations like yours where i had to move out of my home to pay my rent.",
  "i would be willing to talk to them if they would be understanding",

  "you're welcome!",
  "it sounds as though you are doing everything you can to stay healthy.",

  "i am doing well. what's on your mind?",
  "ah i see. my daughter used to do that too. i can understand how frustrating it is to be unable to control her.",
  "yes, i know it can make you feel bad, but it is never too late to try to speak to them about the situation!",

  "you are very intelligent! you deserve it!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what kind of things do you do for a living?",
  "is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "that is very good to hear. it'll help you to connect with people who care about you.",

  "what is troubling you the most?",
  "yes i can understand that. i think it might be hard to create a template for the videos.",
  "yes, i think so.",
  "i hope that you can find a solution to your problem. i've had my share of issues in the past where people were hostile towards me. i think it'll be okay for you to do the same.",

  "of course! i hope you feel better soon!",

  "i think it's a great idea to reach out for support. it'll be great to have someone to talk through these feelings with.",

  "oh no. i'm so sorry to hear that. that's rough.",
  "hello. how are you doing today?",
  "i can completely understand how you feel. it'll be a struggle to keep up with the kids, but it will pass eventually.",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. it sounds like your boss is being unfair and i'd suggest taking a deep breath and telling him how you feel.",
  "have you considered speaking to him about it? it might be useful to help him understand that his opinion is not yours and he doesn t need to be told that he is wrong or that he isn't worthy of your support.",
  "have you talked to him about it?",
  "i understand. sometimes talking through a big plan can help me too.",

  "so you are saying that you want to get out of the house, take a walk, get fresh air, etc...?",
  "i think the most important thing right now is to look for something else.",

  "you're welcome. i wish you all the best with everything!",
  "i would love for you to share what is bothering you.",

  "if you don't talk to anyone you might hurt yourself",
  "i am glad i could be of help",
  "how are you today?",
  "that's a great idea!",
  "well if he did, you can tell him that you are not sure if he is allowed to invite you to his own party.",
  "i hope that helped!",
  "i've been in the same situation many times. i think you have a lot of experience.",
  "i know that can be hard, but i think you can do it!",
  "yes, it's hard to stay home during a pandemicpandemics.",
  "yes they can, my daughter is 2 and i am working from home with my partner so i can see my family often. they also help me out with our kids and help me pay child care. i have found that it helps me to feel better when i am feeling down.",

  "no problem, i hope that it all works out for you and your girlfriend. it sounds like you guys have a really good relationship and i'd encourage you to talk about this with her, and if she doesn't take it to the next step, then i think that you really are the right one. i think everyone deserves to be kind to each other.",
