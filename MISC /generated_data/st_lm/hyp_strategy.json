  "what about their behaviour is making you upset?",
  "i know how you are feeling, but remember, this is a long time. you can do it!",
  "that is a good way to relieve stress.",
  "i understand. have they offered you any sort of help during this pandemic?",
  "i understand exactly what you mean. it is a terrible feeling to be trapped in a book you enjoy and then have to end it. it feels like you are not doing anything to get done.",
  "i know this is hard, but it'll be okay!",
  "i can understand that. it sounds like you are feeling extremely isolated and isolated. this has been hard for you.",
  "i would try to get some sleep before bed, and go for a walk or something to get your mind off of it.",
  "i understand that you are feeling overwhelmed. have you tried other strategies like meditating or yoga to help you feel better?",
  "you seem to be really smart about the whole thing.",
  "i am not a big fan of either, but i have tried to limit my consumption.",
  "i know exactly how you feel. i am really sorry that you are going through this.",
  "that is a very difficult situation to be in. i know it must be difficult for you to be feeling so down.",
  "it is a very difficult disease to get into.",
  "do you feel like this is happening frequently?",
  "you are welcome!",
  "if they can't tell you that, then you need to speak to them. i am sure that they will be understanding.",
  "wow that's a long time.",
  "marriage is not for everyone, but i believe you are able to make a decision for yourself.",
  "i'm sure you can do it.",
  "you can play volleyball with friends too.",
  "that's good that you are safe, i know that'll make you feel better.",
  "yes, i understand. it is a very common worry to deal with.",
  "yes it is. is there anything specific that you are worried about?",
  "is it possible for you to talk about what you are going through with your family? maybe you can give them some advice on how to handle the situation?",
  "i am glad i could help you.",
  "i understand, it'll be hard to keep up with people.",
  "that'll be a great idea! you've already made the right choice!",
  "i think thats a great idea. i know the feeling of being stuck in a job and not being able to make it through. i hope that helped.",
  "i think that would be a great idea!",
  "so you feel that you are not being able to see her as a friend due to her behavior?",
  "i'm good, thank you for asking. is there anything that's bothering you? do you have anything you'd like to talk about?",
  "that sounds very difficult, is there anything specific that is bothering you?",
  "that is a really good idea. i love dogs and i think you will get over this feeling soon.",
  "i have no idea, i am sorry.",
  "have you spoken to him about the accident at all?",
  "that'll take time. i have been through a similar thing in the past and it took me years to forget about it.",
  "you are very welcome",
  "i know right and sometimes we just forget about the good times and forget about bad.",
  "i understand how scary it can be to have to deal with a stranger who has no idea what they are doing.",
  "i understand your concern, but you can still work and pay bills. it's just the same as working, you will not have to worry about the bills. i would suggest taking your son somewhere safe.",
  "that sounds like a long time, i can imagine you're feeling quite distant right now.",
  "no problem. have a wonderful day.",
  "it's not easy, but it sounds as though he didn't want to see your future.",
  "do you live close to your family or friends?",
  "i would recommend using guided meditation. it'll make you feel more confident.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. is there a reason she wants to be productive?",
  "of course! i think you will do great!",
  "you'll find something. i hope you do too.",
  "i know you are trying hard to make your friends happy. they should love you for who you are.",
  "i'm doing well. what's going on?",
  "i can definitely understand how that would make you feel. i had the same feeling when my ex cheated on me and i found out later that she actually cheated on him with someone else. i felt really bad about it and was really worried that i would be in a better place if i was not.",
  "wow, you have a lot of support in your family.",
  "i've had fights with my boyfriend before too. i think it'd be hard on him to be in such a relationship.",
  "that is good to hear. is there anything specific going on with your job that is making you anxious?",
  "great! i hope it helps!",
  "oh, i see. i can understand that. i have had to work in those situations before.",
  "i can definitely understand how you feel. i had the same issue and went through a similar situation.",
  "i hope you feel better. it sounds like you are trying to help yourself.",
  "you could try to talk to your friends and tell them why you are feeling the way they are?",
  "do you think you can talk to your boss about this?",
  "i think you are a great person to be having a conversation with today!",
  "i think its a great idea. marriage counsellors are great to help couples to work through their feelings and problems and sometimes help them solve them.",
  "you are welcome. i hope you have a lovely day!",
  "you are welcome.. take care",
  "have you tried reaching out to any other job sites or websites?",
  "that'll be a great start!",
  "that is totally understandable. you are not the one that is the one who should have to do that.",
  "i can understand how you feel, i have been in a similar situation myself. i know how hard it is to get surgery.",
  "do you have any other friends or family you can talk to about this situation?",
  "i think you should speak with your local counsellor about this and see if they can work with you.",
  "have you tried to talk to someone about it? i know that sometimes people are able to help with their anger.",
  "is it a science test?",
  "i would also suggest talking to a friend or family member about your depression. i know it's hard, but you are doing your best to help.",
  "what is going on?",
  "it's great that you are on the right path!",
  "how are you today?",
  "i'd be more than happy to share some of those five things. they're worth a try.",
  "ah, so you're a stay at home parent?",
  "yes, things have been tough for everyone. i know how you feel.",
  "i see. she also has several other companies that have hired",
  "yes, they would be! i think the red and white pens would be a great starting point for you. i used to have a yellow one and it was so soothing and soothing. i would recommend a different one too!",
  "can you tell me what's going on?",
  "that is very hard to go through. are you looking for another job?",
  "is there anything else i can help you with today?",
  "i think that is a really good idea to have a healthy conversation with them about it and see if they can be sympathetic towards you",
  "i know you can feel better.",
  "it's been so hard for me to get through these tough times. i've been through it in the past, and it'll definitely be hard at the holidays as well.",
  "have you tried to talk to your credit card company about the situation? they can help you with this kind of stuff.",
  "yes you will have to come and i will have too. however, don't let this become a problem! it's not!",
  "i am happy that i was able to help you. i am sure that you have had some great conversations with others who are facing the same issues you are facing.",
  "i think you should tell him that you are not feeling the same way as he has been, and that you do not want to be with him anymore",
  "you are very welcome. we need you.",
  "i understand. it's hard to see someone else complain when we all want to work the same job.",
  "i've experienced similar things in the past. i think the best thing you can do is to keep your head high, even though it might seem impossible right now.",
  "i think you could do it.",
  "i am also a little annoyed by that. i would rather be able to be with my friends and have someone say no, than have a conversation with someone who i may not even know is willing to listen.",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that.",
  "it really is. we're still young so i've been trying to learn to take care of myself.",
  "i think you could learn how to sesew! i think it would be a great way to start.",
  "i can imagine that she is crafty! it is a very difficult situation to be in. it seems like you are very concerned about your wellbeing.",
  "if you're unhappy with your current relationship, it is reasonable to try and rephrase it to a more objective way. it might make it easier to move forward.",
  "that is a great major! i wish you the best of luck in the future!",
  "i would just make sure you have your vaccines before you start work.",
  "i can see how that would put you in a very difficult situation.",
  "that'sn't a problem. i've been doing the same and it really helps.",
  "i have found that when i am not able to see my loved ones, i find myself more interested in what is on my mind. i try to be more active in my social life.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any idea why he is being so mean?",
  "you're welcome, have a wonderful day.",
  "i think we can all make it through this!",
  "i can tell that you are very proud of your performance and i wish you all the best with your future endeavors.",
  "i understand, what type of work are you interested in?",
  "i have had to deal with a lot of issues in my life but i have been trying to keep myself busy with other things.",
  "i see. do you feel that they have forgotten you?",
  "that is a good idea. maybe you should try to find a balance between what you enjoy and what is not possible.",
  "you can call the landlord and see what they can do, if you feel comfortable enough.",
  "he has control over you. it may be your decision but its yours",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. would you like to tell me more?",
  "i know it is hard, but we learn from our mistakes.",
  "what happened?",
  "that sounds very selfish of her. i would definitely suggest you get counselling.",
  "you've got this, and you'll do great.",
  "i can feel how much you are trying to help me, i can't help you at all, please do not worry.",
  "you too!",
  "hello, how are you doing?",
  "i understand how you feel, it is hard when you feel that you do not have any control over the situation.",
  "there are many online meet ups and groups that allow you to discuss your feelings and feelings.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. do you have any idea how to help others in need?",
  "i understand. i am in the same situation. what type of work are you looking for?",
  "i've been there myself, it can be really hard when you are trying to find a job.",
  "that's great! i am happy to listen and chat with you.",
  "i think that is great that you have been able to cope with the chaos.",
  "what do you mean by that?",
  "that is a good idea. i know that a lot people have been in that situation and it is very hard to find a new job.",
  "i've been doing this for years. i take up yoga and meditation which can help me sleep.",
  "it is a real blessing to know that you are not alone in feeling this way.",
  "when i was homeless i had a lot of problems with my ex.",
  "fighting is a part of life, but you can also take it one day at a time",
  "i'm glad you are feeling better.",
  "have you talked to anyone about this?",
  "i've been stuck at my parents house as well, but i am doing my best to make sure that things are resolved.",
  "it is very hard to lose someone when you love them so much.",
  "try to find one of your friends to talk to",
  "i hope it is able to help!",
  "i can tell how stressed you are because of all those people.",
  "i understand, but try to get some sort of help online, maybe you can apply to job sites, such as the internet",
  "yes we can, i am here for you anytime.",
  "oh, i see. so you are a smart person and you can read? that is a good skill to have!",
  "is he a good friend?",
  "i know how you feel, i have been in the same situation as you. i have a lot on my plate but i can't wait to be home to see the news.",
  "i see. it sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders, so it is definitely worth a try.",
  "i have been in a similar situation before where i had to prepare as much as possible for my exams.",
  "you are most welcome. i am glad you are able to use it more frequently!",
  "oh i see, i don't have kids but i do have a little sister who does",
  "you as well.",
  "it seems like you have a good understanding of the materials and you are learning from your son. does that sound right?",
  "you as well.",
  "i don't believe that is the case at all. i believe you are right to feel a bit nervous about it, and you'd have to be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel.",
  "yes, that is a good idea. you can take a walk to your library, pick up some books, and then you can get some good information about things you want from your partner.",
  "it sounds like you've already taken a lot of classes, so i can see how you'd be worried about your exam.",
  "you'll do great. take care of yourself.",
  "i've been there, it's really rough. it'll be hard to get through, but i know you can do it!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. would you like to tell me what happened?",
  "do you have friends to talk to about your frustrations?",
  "i think that's a good idea.",
  "i know there are a few groups that have been around for a while that can provide support.",
  "i am glad that i could be of some help.",
  "you too!",
  "that'sn't bad. i hope he is feeling better soon.",
  "oh wow! that is horrible! i'm so sorry to hear that. i know how hard that must be. i'd be jealous of you, too. but i'll be sure to be glad that you reached out to someone and apologized for the mistake you made.",
  "i have been doing that since the pandemics started. i am also remote working.",
  "i understand how this can be overwhelming. have there been any ways to help yourself through this?",
  "i think that you can too - you are doing the right thing by starting your own business.",
  "i'm good. how are you? i've been in a lot of trouble lately, but i'll be okay.",
  "hello, i am here. what is going on?",
  "maybe you could make a list of things you want to do on your time off",
  "you should be able to find a job in no time, i know you will.",
  "do you think you might be able to handle them all?",
  "it sounds like you are having trouble getting through this because you are depressed and anxious.",
  "i see. so you feel that you are depressed and need someone to talk to?",
  "i understand how you feel. you are feeling alone, but you are also feeling the same way you are right now.",
  "i can understand that. i also have been feeling a bit of depression lately, but i try to keep my head up.",
  "have you tried talking to him and asking him why he is not being as helpful to you as well as your own health?",
  "you're very welcome. it sounds like you've had a really good conversation with a lot of people and it'll make you feel a lot better to talk to someone about this.",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "i know it'll be hard, but try to remember to love yourself and take care of yourself!",
  "i understand, i have had similar issues before. i think it is best to reach out to people and see what they think, i know that i have found that talking to someone in person helps a lot.",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that, that is a rough situation to be in.",
  "i understand. i have been through this myself.",
  "hello, how are you doing?",
  "what happened?",
  "bye",
  "can you tell me more about your academic pressures?",
  "i've been through a similar situation. i had to deal with it for years and it was really hard. i know it's not fair.",
  "so you would like to be back on track to being an employee again?",
  "yes, that's what i meant. you can also create those friendships online that you can connect with people on there, and when you are comfortable with them, you can hang out with them that way you can feel comfortable with people you don ; t really meet up for a while, before you start looking for new friends.",
  "i see. i know how that feels. i've had a lot of people in my life lose their jobs due to covid. i was able to get through it though and get back on track.",
  "you can also try and talk to your friend about it",
  "i think that is a great idea! i would love to help you find something.",
  "it sounds like they might just need some time to get to know you and not care so much about how you feel right now.",
  "if he is so committed to you, he would have committed to doing so regardless of your reasons for wanting to end the relationship",
  "i am doing good. how are things?",
  "i am sorry to here that. what happened?",
  "oh i am so sorry i did not know that. have you talked to a counselor?",
  "i don ; t either. i don t want to risk anything.",
  "i think that'll be an enormous worry for both of you. the best thing is that you're not worried about your health, and you've already made the right decision. you'll feel so much better!",
  "that sounds like a really fun time!",
  "what's going on with you? is there anything specific that is causing it?",
  "i hope that i have been able to help you.",
  "i am so happy to hear that! i hope things start to look up for you soon.",
  "bye",
  "do you know how much distance you'll need to travel?",
  "you are very welcome. i hope you find something that helps.",
  "how are you today?",
  "yoga is very helpful and it can be quite cheap and even free. i highly recommend it!",
  "that is a good idea!!",
  "do you think that you might be able to make an effort to reach out to your parents to speak to them?",
  "that's a great idea! it's good that you have that plan!",
  "i think that if you can take a step back and look at things from an objective point of view, it will make you feel better.",
  "i'm a big fan of hip hop and rap. i listen to a lot of rap music.",
  "yeah, i am in georgia.",
  "try to stay positive and try to take some precautions",
  "have you tried searching for jobs online?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you might be able to have some sort of arrangement where you can talk to each other online?",
  "do you think you can go back to school?",
  "do you have any family members who might be able or able to help you out financially?",
  "it's great that you have someone to support you in the new life!",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "i understand where you are coming from, and i think you need to move on from this situation. but you can do it!",
  "have you tried explaining to him that you are having a serious discussion and that you can't continue the conversation because he doesn'; t understand?",
  "have you tried to speak to your manager about this?",
  "that is a very difficult thing to go through.",
  "i know you'll be 95 by the end of march",
  "yes, afraid.",
  "is there anyone else who can help you with this?",
  "well, i think if you are honest with them, they will probably be able to see you doing well.",
  "you're welcome.",
  "do you have any family members you can talk to about this?",
  "i've been tired too. what is going on?",
  "i am sorry to hear that, is there anything specific going on that you are experiencing?",
  "can you tell me more about the contents?",
  "it's always nice to get out and meet new people. i'd suggest joining some groups and getting involved with those who love you the most.",
  "ok. i have had a few friends who are deaf and they have helped me learn sign language.",
  "i think you have made the right decision. you should be proud of yourself.",
  "well i realise you've been treated badly by many people and you are very clearly not the best person for it but it's definitely a step in the right direction and it might be worth looking into.",
  "you're welcome. i hope you feel better.",
  "i am a little bit of a night person myself. sometimes i get up early and do something i enjoy... like go for a run.",
  "you too!",
  "i have been in a lot of relationships with other people with bad heart conditions, i'm sorry you're going through that.",
  "you're welcome.",
  "glad i could be a bit help. take care",
  "have you tried to talk to a professional about this?",
  "i understand that. it's been really hard to stay inside during the panda, but i think you can get through this.",
  "are there any hobbies that you have that you could try to occupy yourself with?",
  "it sounds like you are frustrated at the situation and feel that you have to make a decision to move on from this. is that correct?",
  "try to sleep with a nice soft pillow and see if it helps",
  "what do you mean by that?",
  "it'll get better and i know it. but keep working hard.",
  "that is true. it can be very stressful at times.",
  "i understand. i am in a similar situation.",
  "i'll hit you up in a bit!",
  "i understand. the only thing that i can do is get myself out of there.",
  "i can tell that you are really struggling but that is okay.",
  "have you tried to take some online classes online?",
  "it's definitely a mess, but at least she will be able to pay off the bills.",
  "i'm really sorry to hear that. i've been through the same thing before, and i know how stressful it is. the only way you can do it is to take care of yourself, and do things that make you happy.",
  "i know it has been. i am so glad i was able to help!",
  "i am confident that they will understand that you are trying your best. i believe that the pandemic is not just temporary, but it will be a serious one that will affect the future.",
  "that's a very difficult situation to be in. i can understand that it is difficult to speak to someone who you care about.",
  "yes it is good to take steps. i have found that taking steps is great for my mental health as well",
  "oh no. that's really hard to deal with. have you tried doing some exercises to help your mind work out the thoughts?",
  "i do enjoy reading. and playing soccer.",
  "that sounds like a really good thing. do you think that your gun rights will be fucking after the election?",
  "that sounds like a great plan. are there any particular classes that you enjoy?",
  "do you want to talk about this?",
  "that'll be rough for sure. i have heard that his plans to stop the government from doing anything is really bad though",
  "it sounds like it'll take time to heal.",
  "i am glad to hear that. i hope you are able to find something soon and enjoy it while you can.",
  "i'm glad i could be of some help. i hope you have a good christmas and a wonderful new year.",
  "i understand. i am in the same boat as you. i was so far away from my parents that i had no idea that they were there.",
  "did you see any sign of a breakup? or did you feel as though it was over?",
  "did you tell him?",
  "i am doing well thank you",
  "i think you are making a great decision and i think it is a great idea to seek a mentor that will be willing to help you and support you through this difficult time.",
  "have you tried looking online for free therapy? there are free clinics that are available.",
  "i am sure its frustrating to have to deal with that, especially when you are not sure if they are real friends. but as long they are friends, they will always be there for you, even if you don'think they are just being mean.",
  "i can relate to that. i have had professors that didn't support me in the past, and i felt the same way.",
  "that sounds like a good plan! i think you could find a great book to read. do you think you can find something to keep yourself busy?",
  "you could invite him to your house. have you asked him if he wanted to go on a trip with you?",
  "it's great that you have the courage to confront her. it'll make things easier for both of you.",
  "i also like to think of myself as a little bit of a perfectionist and a bit of an insomniac. i try to just have a few cups of tea and coffee at night.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what has been making you feel anxious?",
  "i understand your frustration, but you can always try to find a new hobby or even a hobby to take the edge off.",
  "i understand that, it can be difficult to find work right now when money is so tight. i have found that if i wait until i can find a job, i have a lot more options for other opportunities.",
  "you too!",
  "well, if you can prove that you did it, then it will be better to report. however, if it is not the case, you need to talk to your boss first, then you can report on the first day of the day.",
  "have you thought about seeing a professional?",
  "you can come to brazil and take the job",
  "i hope everything works out for you.",
  "that is not good. but i think you have to move on because you are in the right place",
  "i think it's best to start small and slowly get better.",
  "you're welcome.",
  "that's great that you have groups and i know that in some cases they are helpful. have you thought of joining any online groups that might be able to help you out?",
  "it sounds like a good idea. have you thought about talking to your covidworkers and seeing if they can help you get a hybrid time?",
  "it sounds like you are feeling a bit down right now.",
  "i hope it goes well for you two and that your marriage will be successful.",
  "yes, i have.",
  "you should be able to request that she be looked after and not treated as unfairly.",
  "it sounds like you're having some hard time finding a new hobby or something that you enjoy doing.",
  "do you know how long ago it was?",
  "well, if you can't get him any gas, maybe you should just take him home to his parents.",
  "i think you should talk to your friend and tell him that you can't be with him like that and then you will find a solution.",
  "i believe that you can share your work with your boss.",
  "sure. if you feel like it.",
  "what do you think they are trying do you have a problem with them",
  "i think they might be.. it'd be great if you could just go outside and exercise more.",
  "i know that insecurities can be a really difficult thing to overcome, but i think it's worth trying to figure out what to do to keep myself from being judged.",
  "why do you think your partner cheated on you?",
  "that sounds like a great idea! i've been in a similar situation before. it'll probably help to talk about things with your friend first. it can be hard to see how your friend will respond to something like that but if it'd be helpful to talk through the situation with your girlfriend, it might help to get some ideas about how you can move on.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what is making you anxious?",
  "what happened?",
  "have a nice day!",
  "i am so sorry that happened. i know how you feel.",
  "i am doing okay, how can i help you? what is your problem?",
  "oh i see. i think its important to remember that they are just people. they can change.",
  "and you have been friends with your exes for awhile, and he still lies. you will never know what he is really up to.",
  "you can take a survey and we can discuss.",
  "that sounds like a great idea. i am sure they will support you.",
  "you too!",
  "it sounds like you are very intelligent and that is a great thing to know.",
  "i am doing well, thank you. can you tell me more about your situation?",
  "do you feel that your friend should be able to understand why you were mad?",
  "i can definitely understand how frustrating that would be. i have done the same thing in the past.",
  "i can tell that you have been through some tough times.",
  "that's good. i've had some issues with my family in the past, but it's gotten better.",
  "i am happy to help!",
  "i had a roommate that i couldn't afford to move in with, and the landlord was really understanding of that and said she could give me some money if i moved in with her. i went to visit my parents later and they were so surprised that i was able to move out without problems.",
  "i know that when i have been in a stressful situation, i try to focus on the things that i am good at, even if it means relearning to do them again.",
  "that is a very difficult situation. i'm sorry you had to deal with it.",
  "i see. it sounds like you are having a hard time sleeping. is that correct?",
  "you are welcome.",
  "your welcome.",
  "i can understand how anxious you are about this, i have been in a similar situation in the past. it is a really difficult time to be in a relationship and it feels like you have no support at all.",
  "i've been in your shoes before and know how difficult it can be to end a relationship. it is important to move on and try to find a better one.",
  "it sounds like you are trying really hard!",
  "that'd be great!",
  "that sounds really hard, especially after three years. how did you guys end up getting through this?",
  "i'd suggest that. it's not a good idea to make your friend feel like he needs to be reminded that you are there for him. it might be helpful for you to give him a little break, too.",
  "well if you're feeling depressed then you should seek therapy because that's what you want.",
  "i am not sure what that means. can you tell me?",
  "it sounds like you are struggling with a lot of subjects that you can'ti test on.",
  "it sounds like you are having a hard time finding a solution.",
  "i am doing well. what is going on?",
  "dogs are wonderful companions. they make me feel cared for.",
  "it has been such a scary time, i think we are going to have to wait for the pandemicates to end and see what happens.",
  "how are you today?",
  "oh well, that's too bad. maybe you can take a nap and go to bed.",
  "just give them a hug and say, i can'; t be the only one who feels this way.",
  "you're very welcome. i wish you all the best and hope you have some happy holidays!",
  "i would suggest reaching out to someone close by to see if they can talk to you. i know they are going to be understanding and understanding of your feelings.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, what happened?",
  "i also took it that just getting into the field was more important than the financial risks.",
  "i am sure you will! i am glad i was able to provide some support.",
  "so, they are worried you will always be perfect?",
  "have you tried speaking to your friend about it?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i'd recommend looking for a job online and see if you can find one online.",
  "it seems like it is really hard to move on from this situation.",
  "i started feeling depressed and gave up on anything that was bothering me. i took a few months to forget everything i had and then i started to find another partner.",
  "you are welcome. hope i was able to be of some help. you are very welcome.",
  "have you thought about doing some hobbies to help you get through this? i know there are a lot of different types of hobbyists out there.",
  "there are lots of volunteer groups in fl",
  "oh wow, that is very unsettling. have you tried to speak with your ex about this?",
  "hello, how are you doing?",
  "i would start with a local church. you can search for survivor groups online. there are some that are nonprofits that could help you.",
  "i've always found that video games are a great source of inspiration for me. i like to play with my friends and we go on a crazy trip together. have any of your friends been playing?",
  "you are being very unfair to yourself.",
  "i think that you should be able to talk to someone about it, if you are ready for it. but you should do it alone.",
  "have you tried medication that can help with your anxiety?",
  "i see that it is difficult for you to talk to them because of how much you are dealing with this.",
  "i am glad to hear that! it sounds like you are making progress!",
  "i know how you feel. i have found that if i do not take something like a shower or a bath, i can feel a bit more normal.",
  "i hope you have a good day : )!",
  "please end the survey. please can i continue?",
  "i was going on my own and i really enjoyed it.",
  "that is a really long time. it must be hard to see your partner get involved with another person.",
  "you've got this!",
  "do you have any hobbies or interests?",
  "i can see how it would be a difficult time for you. i also believe that you are doing the best you can.",
  "it'll be a bit, what's been making you feel that way?",
  "i am doing well. how are you feeling today?",
  "sounds like a great idea!",
  "i can understand that. it'll be hard to get a job when you are at work, but it is important to be prepared.",
  "have you considered talking to your teachers about how you are being treated?",
  "i can understand how you feel. i have been in that situation many times.",
  "i think you need some time to heal. maybe you should talk to your doctor and get some help.",
  "i can see how that would make you feel a bit anxious",
  "i can imagine how upset you are about this. i would not forgive him either.",
  "you seem like a really strong person to be able to recognize that you don't have the same emotions that you need right now.",
  "it sounds like you are working hard to improve your work abilities, and you are very willing to take the steps to get there.",
  "i've been in a similar situation, it can be hard to see someone coming out of a breakup.",
  "hello, how are you doing?",
  "what about a dog?",
  "yeah that's a great starting point! i know that i'd love to be an electrician.",
  "oh ok, i see. that's a good idea. i know it'll take some time to get used to but you can do it!",
  "i hope you find the right person, and that you can find a better one soon!",
  "you're welcome. i hope that i have been able to help you.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i lost mine a couple of months ago too. it can be hard to find a job right now.",
  "i understand your frustration but i believe that we can overcome this with time and keep things somewhat stable.",
  "what would you like to talk about?",
  "i have been in your shoes, and i know how hard it is to be fired. i had to quit my job due to covid.",
  "do you think you have any friends who could be your best friends?",
  "it sounds like you have a good handle on this and you've got this!",
  "i understand how you feel. i also have felt this way before. it took a lot to overcome. it's natural to feel that way.",
  "is there something else bothering you? is there anything else bothering the boss that you are concerned about?",
  "i'm doing well. how can i help you today?",
  "have you tried talking to your husband about the situation? maybe he could try to find some common ground where you are able to have some fun times with him.",
  "have you talked to your friends about how you feel about the situation?",
  "so you feel that you should not be able to attend because your other friends didn't feel the need to invite you?",
  "you don't need to live worry about it. it is important to make sure you've been able to speak with each other about it and make sure that you both feel that you'd love each other more if you had to do it every time",
  "great! it sounds as though you've already found the solution.",
  "yes, sorry i was afk... so what happened?",
  "it was frustrating at first but then i had to learn that it is not a matter of if it's for you or for your boss. i just wanted to make sure that i was being fair and that i could be the one to do my job well.",
  "have you tried to explain to her why she is acting that way?",
  "you too!",
  "i'd definitely be worried too. it's natural to feel anxious when things start to get uncertain, and you have to learn to accept that.",
  "i've been there before. it can be very stressful.",
  "oh wow, black people are so hot! i bet you're very proud of her.",
  "i would recommend to look online to see if there is anything you can do to help.",
  "i have not but i have heard that if you've been evented before it is generally not legal to evict someone.",
  "is there anything else i can help you with today?",
  "you are very welcome. i hope you feel better about your situation.",
  "i would suggest talking to her in person, and see how it goes. if she does not care, then she will not be able to see your actions as valid as she is right now.",
  "i think you should get a dog that you can take with you to visit your family",
  "i am glad i could help. you seem to have a great head on your shoulders.",
  "that's great! do you enjoy your job? how do you feel about the career field?",
  "what are some ways you can make it through this?",
  "i have faith you will get a job soon!",
  "have you tried to talk about your depression with your boyfriend?",
  "i can see how that would be frustrating.",
  "do you enjoy other holiday's as well?",
  "so you saw chat history?",
  "zoom meetings are fun but also not the best for your children. you should look into a group for students who are interested in zoom learning",
  "it is a really good idea to cut your hair! i think it is very healthy and healthy to have a healthy hair.",
  "so you are just a lonely person and your friends don'treciprocated as much?",
  "no problem! i hope things start looking up for you!",

  "i know that this pandemic has been very stressful and i can understand how you feel.",
  "yes, i do. i do it by myself.",
  "sure. bye",
  "oh no, that sounds very frustrating. why do you think that is?",
  "i think that would be a good idea.",
  "does he have any friends or family near him who could help him with his work?",
  "i am sorry to hear that, you are in a bad place. do you have any friends that you can reach out to for advice?",
  "have you tried to talk to him about the situation?",
  "are you still able to work?",
  "i know it'll be hard, but i know you can do it!",
  "maybe you should move somewhere where there is no conflict?",
  "i am glad to hear you are getting some help from a counselor. i have been in a similar situation before where i felt as though i was being overwhelmed and overwhelmed by the amount of people who were talking.",
  "i'm good, thanks for asking. what's going on with you? i'll take care of you.",

  "you too, have a good rest of your christmas",
  "it is my pleasure! i wish you all the best in the future!",
  "how long ago did this happen? i know it can be tough to find out what important things in life are.",
  "i believe you can. if you set goals too high, you won't be able too study as much as you think.",
  "i am happy to hear that.",
  "i have also felt that taking more time outside of my work has been helpful. i am also glad that you are taking some time out of your day to enjoy yourself.",
  "it's good that you are talking to them. it helps to be able to talk.",
  "that's a great idea. you can still focus on other things.",
  "have a good day",
  "no, there is no chance of finding out",
  "so you're nervous that you won't get it?",

  "hi there, how are you doing today?",
  "that is wonderful! i hope that i have been able to give you some helpful advice on how to approach things. i hope you have an amazing day.",
  "i understand how you are feeling. have you been able to talk to your therapist about this?",
  "i understand. i also enjoy talking with people.",
  "have you thought about talking to a professional to help with the upload process?",
  "it is a scary world out there.",
  "from florida too, its been nice to chat with you.",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "i think that's the right attitude. maybe try giving them a call or something to see if they want to talk about it.",
  "true : ) i do realise that it'd be hard to hide it from people though.",
  "have you talked to your mom about this?",
  "what is bothering you? anything specific?",
  "i see, so you would say that you like female females more than male females?",
  "it's really not worth it, it'll be a long process, but i'm sure you will be able to get unemployment",
  "yes, it is.",
  "i am sorry. do you have any siblings?",
  "i completely understand that. it sounds to me like you have a lot of things in your life that you really want to do, but are looking for a better job to go into.",
  "yes you can",
  "i would be nervous too if my partner were acting like that.",
  "have you ever thought about getting a tutor?",
  "it sounds like you are being upset at your friend.",
  "i understand. i have been in a similar situation before, and it is extremely difficult to deal with when you've already failed a test.",
  "i think that would be a great idea. you seem like a very positive person to try and reach out for support. i have personally done it myself and it has helped me a lot.",
  "i would also like to suggest that you talk to her again, as soon as possible. if it doesn't go through, then it is your problem, not hers.",
  "i would suggest that you talk to a professional about it and see what they think.",
  "so you are feeling upset because you were supposed to get out of the situation by leaving for dallas?",
  "i've had to go through a similar situation a few times. it can be very frustrating at first but it can really help to get back into the swing of things.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. is there something you'd like to talk about?",
  "oh no. what's going on?",
  "i hope i have been able to help. i know how difficult this is for you and i am sure you will be able to make through this!",
  "i can understand how you would feel upset at something that is not your fault. do i have anything to say about this?",
  "i am very upset about this and that we have even lost our jobs",
  "if i were you i would try to make a list of things you can do to secure your job and see what jobs are available.",
  "i know that is hard to deal with when you are working for such a long time.",
  "thank you, you too!",
  "yes, i hear you on that. i'm sorry you're feeling this way.",
  "are you having trouble sleeping?",
  "sleep is good and you are welcome",
  "bye",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. are you feeling down?",
  "you too! i hope that this semester goes well for you.",
  "i have been trying to find work while i've been out of school as well. it has been hard but i'll get there.",
  "please let me know if you need any help with anything else. i am happy to help",
  "hi, how are you doing today?",
  "ah i see, well i do hope that things will get better for you soon. maybe you could ask your husband if he would be willing to help you too?",
  "bye!!!",
  "i have had sleep issues as well. it is very hard.",
  "yes, you will be fine.",
  "how are you?",
  "i understand that it is difficult to get the sleep you need and that you do not feel like you can sleep.",
  "that is completely understandable. communication can help.",
  "i see. you feel like you cannot get a better relationship with your parents?",
  "that's really difficult. i know you can do this!",
  "i understand.. it is a very scary place to be. i'm glad you are doing so much to help your daughter.",
  "hi! how are you doing today?",
  "i can understand that you've been worried about that. i would say you have a good idea what you need to do to get passed the class",
  "you are welcome! have a wonderful day!",
  "hi! how are you?",
  "i can tell that you have been trying hard and your partner doesn't want to hear it.",
  "i don't think giving up is a bad thing. the movie will hopefully bring you peace and you will be happy.",
  "that sounds like a really fun time. i've been in that position before and it was very fun.",
  "i can understand that, i have also struggled with depression and anxiety and sleep issues.",
  "oh, wow. that'sn't very healthy. i don'think you should let that stop you from getting a girlfriend!",
  "i am glad i was able to help you today",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i've been there too. i can relate to that feeling. what makes you feel this way?",
  "i am glad to be here too!",
  "okay, good. please come back and finish the convo.",
  "you'll get through it : ) have a great night!",
  "i understand. it can be very hard to talk about your problems with people. i think it would be better if you talked about it with someone you trust.",
  "and i am sure that you are making great decisions about your future and are doing a great job with it.",
  "that is completely understandable. i also have been in a similar situation before, and it was very hard. i felt that there was no solution, and i felt like there was nothing i could do about it.",
  "oh yeah, i totally understand. i also had an ex who was obsessed with star war stuff.",
  "that can be frustrating. have you talked to him about it?",
  "i understand, but you don'thing that will happen in life. if you want to be a high profile profile, you can only get a little bit more than a jr profile.",
  "i think if you talk it through, he will probably understand that it is a matter of opinion. you don't need to press anything, you just need to have a conversation with him about it. if he doesn't understand, it can be frustrating to be ignored and even more difficult to be open to other viewpoints.",
  "i understand, but you need to be honest with yourself",
  "you are welcome, i wish you all the best!",
  "i understand the feeling of being laid off during the lockdown, i have been there myself.",
  "have you tried looking online? there are a lot of opportunities for people with similar skills.",
  "i am good, thank you. how can i help you today?",
  "i think that it would help if you were able to talk about this with her. it would make her more open to how you feel.",
  "you're welcome. i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.",
  "that is a great idea. i'm glad to hear that you were able to see your future ahead.",
  "is there any reason you don't have any money in your savings?",
  "okay. i understand. have you thought about looking for work after school?",
  "i think that would be a great place to start.",
  "you are welcome. i hope you are feeling better now.",
  "why do you think that is?",
  "yes, you can do that. i would try to connect with both of them to see if they are happy with each other.",
  "hi, how are you today?",
  "i hope i have been able to be of some help. i'm glad to be here.",
  "you're welcome : ) have a great day!",
  "i am here, just waiting to chat with you.",
  "i understand that you are worried about your friend.",
  "i'm glad that you're doing your best to help. i think you are doing everything you can to keep yourself safe and healthy.",
  "but i think you can overcome this - you can do it!",
  "that is awesome!",
  "have you tried any activities that help you feel better?",
  "hello. how are you doing?",
  "i am not agian but i am glad i could help you today",
  "that'd be great! i think you could make some good friends through the youtube videos and try to connect with others who are feeling the same way.",
  "i've been in the same position myself. i can tell you from experience, i'm a pretty strong person, and i don'thing i'd ever be able to crack a job. i'll bet you're very intelligent and proactive, and would be able too.",
  "i am glad i could help.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "i understand that you are worried about not being able to afford your bills, that is very hard.",
  "do you feel that this would be a significant enough reason to want to change your employment schedule?",
  "you could try to look at yourself as a leader in this situation and see how you can make it through.",
  "oh no, i've been there too. break ups are the worst.",
  "it sounds like you're having a hard time finding a solution to your situation. is that correct?",
  "that is really hard, i am sorry",
  "i agree with you completely. i also have a son who is 25 and is very spoiled. it is so hard to see parents like this.",
  "i've been studying for the 2020 exam! it'll be exciting!",
  "if you're willing to sacrifice yourself to get a gym, you should be willing to do it.",
  "have you thought of talking to your professor about this?",
  "i am doing well, thank you. what is on your mind?",
  "i have been through a lot of emotions and i do understand how you feel.",
  "good bye",
  "i wish you all the best with everything.",
  "you too",
  "yes that would be a great start!",
  "do you have a close friend that you can talk to about this?",
  "i hear you. i have been in this same situation. i try to set aside time for myself before bed to get my mind off of things. it'll help to relax and get some rest.",
  "i think that would be a great first step! and yes, there are definitely people out there who feel trapped. i know a lot of people who are struggling to get by, and it can be really hard.",
  "i'd suggest a friend or family member that is close to you that you can spend time with. you could connect with them through video calls or text messages, and then share some ideas on what's going on.",
  "do you have any other friends or family that you can talk to about this?",
  "hi how are you today?",
  "yes, we all need to make the best of our situation.",
  "i've been there before, it's not easy. you will be fine!",
  "i see. have you talked to anyone about this?",
  "hello, how are you doing?",
  "i can understand that. there is no need to panic. you will get the job.",
  "i definitely understand. i also find that it'll help to take a few minutes to myself before i go to bed, then i can sleep. i usually do something like 10 minutes before bed, or if i'd like to go for a walk or something, i'll take a shower and then do something else.",
  "it's been a pleasure speaking with you. i hope things go well for you.",
  "i am glad i could be of some help.",
  "yes, you can face him. if he wants to see you face him then you should face him face to face.",
  "i would suggest starting with just your friends and going to some bar or something. i am sure you will meet someone awesome.",
  "you're very welcome : )",
  "i can relate to how you are feeling. i have been in a similar situation and know what it's like to be angry at someone.",
  "you too!",
  "you're so welcome! i hope you feel better soon.",
  "i understand that feeling. it's been a long time since i was through something like this. i know you will be okay.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what happened?",
  "i used to love listening to instrumental music. do they have any instruments or instruments you like to listen to?",
  "i can see how you'd feel overwhelmed if your supervisor doesn't take your calls. it's especially difficult when you have a project you've been working on and your boss isn't taking your calls, and it'd be difficult to get through a day without your supervisor.",
  "if you both want to talk about the situation, maybe you can discuss this with him and see if he'd like to have a conversation with you, instead of him on social media.",
  "what about the professor?",
  "i think that is a very valid point.",
  "it'll be tough, but at least you have a plan and a plan to take care of yourself.",
  "what i would recommend is taking a few deep breaths and getting to know yourself. you seem like you are doing a good job!",
  "do you have any hobbies you could use to keep yourself busy?",
  "that sounds really difficult. have you considered finding a new hobby or two to work on?",
  "i've been in the south for a long time. we have a lot of snow on our ground but it'll get better.",
  "it sounds like you have a really good understanding of your own feelings and need. you are making a great choice.",
  "yes, i do. i like them too.",
  "that's great that you've learned from them and you can see them as a reflection of you!",
  "i think it sounds like you are trying really hard to teach your son to be more proactive.",
  "i understand how you feel. i also have had to go through a similar situation in my life, and it can be extremely difficult.",
  "i use a lot of free sites like yendercom and instagram to look for useful sites.",
  "that's a shame, they should be able to help you out financially",
  "i would just try and let her know that you care about her and want her happy, and that you will try to help her in the future.",
  "you are a great parent. i'm sure you will be able to find someone who will treat you well!",
  "is there anything else you'd like to talk about?",
  "i've been in that situation before. it's not easy at all.",
  "i'm so sorry to here that. this is a very hard time for everyone.",
  "i can tell you are very strong. i know you can do it.",
  "i have been through the same thing. it can be very difficult to make a plan and it can take a while.",
  "oh, i see. so you have kids and you're having a tough time dealing with it?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what is bothering you? i am glad to listen.",
  "i think it definitely does! if you like music or other music it can really help to energize your mind",
  "i know that it can be tough, but i think you have to learn to let this loss pass.",
  "that'll be a great start!",
  "that is a very hard situation. i've been in that position and it's really difficult to get a handle on things.",
  "i'm not sure about that, but i've been looking into it myself.",
  "i worked for the company that i wanted to work for so i went to a local university where i could go.",
  "have you ever tried to talk to your friends about your feelings? i have found that talking to them helped me through some of my breakup anxiety.",
  "i've been there before, and i found that talking to a professional helped a lot.",
  "thanks! i hope you have a great day.",
  "i am glad that you reached out to me today. you sound like a wonderful person who is willing to help others.",
  "i had to work really hard to not feel depressed.",
  "it sounds like you might be able to find a way to keep yourself busy while you wait for school to start.",
  "i have a daughter too, she is 2 months old now. i remember when she was born, everyone was freaking out.",
  "i am a female. i can tell that you are not very helpful",
  "i'm glad i could help, i've had a rough day with work and i know how hard it can be.",
  "it sounds like you are doing the right thing.",
  "sorry, it is my fault.",
  "you too. i wish you all the best in your future endeavors.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i know you are feeling very overwhelmed and stressed about this situation.",
  "you need to talk to them about it and see if they are right.",
  "i've been through something similar in the past. parents are usually not looking for the truth when they are in trouble. it'll take time.",
  "i don't know if you can give me advice on that, but i would recommend you to try and make a plan for the next time you're going to work. it might help you to remember that you've been there for a long time and that you aren't just a one person.",
  "you don't need to be right now. you need to stay in touch.",
  "i think there are a lot of people who would feel that way.",
  "i would definitely recommend it.",
  "i understand completely, i have been in a similar situation.",
  "that is incredibly bad. i would not recommend that you end the relationship unless you absolutely have to.",
  "please don'feel nervous, because we all do",
  "have you ever tried to talk to your boss about this issue? it may help to find out what the cause of the problem is.",
  "that sounds very difficult. have you talked to your family about how you feel?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that...",
  "of course. i am glad that i was able to help.",
  "i agree with you on that. what kind of entertainer is your entertainer?",
  "it'll take time to get used to, but you can do it!",
  "i can understand that. i have been down too. what is making you feel down?",
  "i see, so you're feeling a bit more stressed than usual?",
  "thank you! it's been nice talking to you today.",
  "oh no!!!",
  "you too!",
  "that's a long time to have a relationship with someone who doesn'tknow whats best for you, you can't be so sure.",
  "bye",
  "i agree, it'll be hard for everyone to keep their records when they are in a position to be able to make a living. have a look at how long you can work in a store, or online grocery stores. there will be opportunities to meet your needs when you're out of work.",
  "it sounds like you have been trying your best and i know you are doing your best. i wish you all the best in your future.",
  "i understand. family can be very difficult to be around during the holidays.",
  "how can i help you today?",
  "i am glad i could help you today.",
  "i am sure you are feeling a lot better now than before.",
  "i hope you have a great day!",
  "that sounds like a lot of work. is there anything specific that you'd like to talk about?",
  "you have every right to feel that way. the only thing you can do is to take care of yourself and your daughter, and i know it sounds difficult but it is true.",
  "i know! we used to play soccer together and we were so much fun! now i live alone and it's hard to find a friend.",
  "i see, so you are saying your job loss is affecting your ability to get a haircut?",
  "i am glad to hear that. have a great day!",
  "you need to press quit first and take the survey.",
  "that'll be a start, maybe try to talk to your doctor about this?",
  "i have been through a similar situation and i can tell you that you will be stronger than ever!",
  "that is really difficult. it sounds like you are in a really difficult spot and you are going through a hard time.",
  "hi there, how are you today?",
  "you too!",
  "have you thought about getting a second monitor for your next class?",
  "bye!",
  "that'll take some time but it will definitely help",
  "ok, so it is the same thing but we are learning the same subject",
  "what is going on that is making you feel down?",
  "is he your best friend?",
  "i think it will be ok to move on with your life and move on without her. you will eventually get through this and your friend can see who he truly is",
  "you can do it, don'; t let this stress you out.",
  "that is a very difficult situation. i think you need to talk to your spouse and get some help from her to make sure she is okay.",
  "so you feel that you are struggling because of your school schedule?",
  "i think it'd be great if you were able to talk to your boss and see how he'd see you doing. it'll help you to realise that you are doing what you want to do.",
  "is there any way you can communicate with her about the virus?",
  "i can tell you are not feeling as well as you think. this is a difficult situation.",
  "courseras course is very good, it has a very short tutorial on how to use the internet.",
  "you should definitely get some counseling. i know you are going through some rough times right now, but you will get through it!",
  "are there any things that you can do to relax?",
  "i hope that it goes well for you, i know that is hard to deal with.",
  "i can see how you are feeling. it is a difficult time to start school.",
  "all the same!",
  "ouch... that must be frustrating.",
  "you are doing great! i am sure you will do great.",
  "i am so glad you are starting to get some help from someone!",
  "is this a temporary position?",
  "how does this make you feel?",
  "i hope i have helped you today! i hope that you have a wonderful christmas!",
  "that sounds like a very difficult situation to be in. i know that you are very concerned and i can certainly understand how it would be difficult.",
  "it sounds like you are very concerned about your job being less fun than it should.",
  "do you feel that your job is more important than your current one?",
  "i am well, thank you for asking. what is on your mind?",
  "yes it is but it is not as bad as depression. it can take a toll on people.",
  "you're welcome. have a lovely night!",
  "i would suggest that you talk to someone like a professional about this. they might be able to help you",
  "it sounds like you are not a very good student.",
  "i understand. have you tried to talk to your friend about it?",
  "how are you?",
  "i think that would be really helpful!",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. i am sorry you are not able to buy your children christmas gifts. have you tried getting them some gifts that are not expensive?",
  "well, have you considered volunteering at a local church or other local community center?",
  "i talked to my friends about the problems and they were able to help me with my problems.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. are you feeling stressed or depressed?",
  "i am here, thanks for asking.",
  "yes, you can do anything you want!",
  "i would be too. this is a very common issue in work environments.",

  "wow, that's terrible. i've been in that situation before. i can understand why you were upset.",
  "ok, i understand. how do you feel about your friend leaving?",
  "i think spending time on hobbythings can be a great place to start. i personally enjoy reading, playing with my cat, and just doing things for fun. i also enjoy reading and playing video games.",
  "have you considered counselling?",
  "that sounds like a great time! how are you doing today?",
  "do you have any other hobbies or interests that you enjoy doing?",
  "i am glad you are trying to keep in touch. we need to stay strong and keep our minds off of it.",
  "do you have a plan or a plan of action to try to cope with that?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i have an auto immune problem too. i know how hard it can be.",
  "i can understand why they're mad at you, especially if you reported it. that sounds like a very serious issue. i've dealt with similar issues in my life before and it'll always be hard to deal with.",
  "you're welcome.",
  "you are very welcome. i am glad i could help.",
  "you have to press quit from your end. it is very hard to do that from my side.",
  "it sounds like you are worried about your job and are worried that you might be fired.",
  "i can tell you've been through a lot.",
  "wow, that is a really good opportunity. you are doing great!",
  "i understand how you feel. the first wave of cases were already pretty bad, but there are still some bad ones. i know it'll be okay, and you'll feel better in the long run.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, it sounds like you have a lot of stress going on.",
  "it is a very hard time right now.",
  "have you considered talking to your girlfriend about this?",
  "oh haha! that's so funny! i'm a cat!",

  "i can definitely see why you are worried about that! i think it's important to be prepared for everything.",
  "i'm doing well. is there anything you'd like to talk about today?",
  "i have had stress issues before and i think it is normal to have that problem. what do you think is causing the stress?",
  "i am sorry to hear about that. i understand that covid 19 has a lot to do with it.",
  "oh wow! that's awesome!",
  "that is hard. i know it must be hard to move away from your best friend and the rest of the family, but you have to stay strong and be strong.",
  "i have to say, i have been in this situation many times. i am glad i am not the only one who has been in that situation. i know it can be very stressful at times. but there is no one else in my life that is as strong as i am. i believe we all have a plan, and that's why we are here.",
  "have you talked to your professor about it?",
  "maybe you could try to talk about your feelings with your friends, family, and others? it may help to talk it out with them and let them know that you are feeling sad and that you have a hard time dealing with it. maybe you can talk about how you feel and see if there is any solution.",
  "have you considered getting a job online? it is often a great way to get a new career path.",
  "you are welcome.",
  "no i have not, i have never had any issues with depression and anxiety.",

  "okay, so you want an expert in those things.",
  "okay, i understand. is this something you've considered before?",
  "do you feel that you are ready to move back to your home? i am sure you will be fine.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what is making you feel this way?",
  "i think you will find that you can overcome this!",
  "have you tried to talk to your friends or family about this? they can sometimes help you with that.",
  "you are very welcome! i am glad you are feeling better.",
  "i've had that happen to me. i always think of myself as a good person and i'll make a good choice!",
  "there are many chat groups where you can talk to people about this issue.",

  "how are you doing today?",
  "what kind of careers were you thinking of switching to?",
  "yes, socializing is hard. i would suggest going on phone calls or video calls.",
  "i understand, i have also been in a similar situation and it was very stressful. have you tried reaching out to your local job boards and asking for help?",
  "have you tried to discuss this with your boss directly?",
  "so you were given a choice in what type of help you would like to provide to your sister?",
  "thank you! you as well!",
  "i have a general problem with my mental health, but i also have a problem with depression.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. how did they do that?",
  "thank you!",
  "oh no, what happened?",
  "i've been feeling a bit better, thank you!",
  "do you feel that she is being unfair?",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "it's good to get out there and get out.",
  "do you feel like the holidays are making you feel isolated?",
  "you are welcome! i hope you feel better soon.",
  "no problem. i hope you can get a chance to do longer videos.",
  "i can understand that. i had to do the same for myself. i realized that it wasn't worth my time and energy to move on from it and instead was just to try and live my life and forget about it. i found it much easier to move forward with my life now.",
  "that sounds like a great idea. i think that you can do it!",
  "is there a way to talk about this with him? maybe a meeting place?",
  "i am sure you will find something that works for you.",
  "that's great to hear. what's going on with you?",
  "you are very welcome and i hope i have been of some help",
  "have you been able to work from home since then?",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "it's great that you have a new home!",
  "i understand. i also have a problem with group work. i have had to learn how to avoid it. however, i've found that once i get enough help, i can overcome my anxiety.",
  "do you have any other pets?",
  "i would love to help you with that. i would suggest taking a few deep breaths and letting your mind heal.",
  "sometimes, we have to accept that we are all suffering, and we have every right to feel sad.",
  "yes. i am sure it will be fine.",
  "it sounds like you have a lot going on at your job and you feel that you need to take some time to reflect on it.",

  "have you all spoken to him about it?",
  "i have been in a similar situation and it was really painful to see my ex do that to me.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i know that loss of a job can cause a lot of emotions and sadness.",
  "do you have any friends or family that you can talk to about it?",
  "that'll be great. is he your best friend?",
  "if you can'feel that your coworker has made you feel that way, then you might want to talk to your boss and see what he's up to. i think that'll help you feel better.",
  "i can imagine, i would be too. but i am sure you can handle it! you deserve someone who respects you as much as anyone.",
  "sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.",
  "i am glad you were able to talk to me today.",
  "i am not sure. i am sure that if you take care of your dog, it will make you more happy.",
  "what's going on?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. do you have a specific time you are feeling low?",
  "it's good that you know what you're doing, but also know that you've got to make the right choice.",
  "i wish you all the very best! i would do the same thing if i were you. i don ; t know how you will handle it, but it will be okay!",

  "do u know if u can talk to them?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what's going on?",
  "oh wow that'll be hard for sure, i can't imagine how upset you are feeling.",
  "i have a special lamp that i use that helps me get my mind off things that i've been trying so far.",
  "that'll also be a good starting point. you can take a break, and then go back home.",
  "i totally understand. i am a bit of a nerd myself and i would definitely feel the same way if i were in your shoes.",
  "i'd be scared to go anywhere without my job though - i'll be worried about the backlash.",
  "that sounds like a lot to deal with.",
  "i am a real people and i watch anime and movies.",
  "yes i know that you can learn to play piano, but the piano is not as good as the piano.",
  "have you considered that you might be right? it depends on how long he is willing to accept it. if he is not, you could try to tell him that you think he is being unfair for not accepting it. and that you will never be on the same terms as him.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what seems to be the issue?",
  "i am good, thank you for asking. what is on your mind today?",
  "what are your hobbies?",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. i have been in a similar situation as you. it's hard to learn to let go of these emotions.",
  "i understand. it is hard to find new friends and even when we do, we all seem to forget about the past.",
  "that's a great idea! it would help to take a vacation. you have a lot more experience and a husband.",

  "do you have any other concerns?",
  "i see. that is a difficult situation to be in. it must be difficult for you to be able to tell your wife about it.",
  "i've been in that position before, and it'll happen again. doug isn't the only one that needs to go through this.",
  "you can drive to the store, too",
  "i can understand that. what do you think the manager will say?",
  "ok. well i can tell you that its hard to connect with people who are distant. you can try to spend time with them and then see if you can find someone that will be willing to help you through this.",

  "i understand. it is hard to find help when we live in a tough time.",
  "i think everyone does! i've seen a lot of people look at cover letters and think that they've been following directions, but they aren't.",
  "yes, they are! you can say yes if you feel that you need to!",
  "that sounds like a great idea. it's a good time to look into options to move forward with the world and find some new opportunities.",
  "i do too, and it really helps.",
  "of course!",
  "i know you are feeling down but you have to keep trying",
  "you're welcome! i've been feeling a little bit better myself..",
  "i hope that i have been able to give you some relief.",
  "it's been really nice to talk to you.",
  "you seem to be concerned because of your mom's injury and not because you want her to be healthy.",
  "if you are unable to sleep then you might need to start doing some physical activity to help you relax. do you have any friends that can talk to you about this?",
  "is there anything i can help you with today?",
  "i think the best way to get through this is to take a few deep breaths and take some deep breaths.",
  "i understand that you are not having luck with your art projects. is there anything else that you'd like to talk about?",
  "i can understand that it must be overwhelming for you, but you need to take care of yourself first.",

  "so you are having trouble keeping up with your classes and you are feeling anxious about it?",
  "you are very welcome i hope it helps",

  "yes i did! it was a great deal. i wish you all the best with your skilling.",
  "i also noticed that if i am doing something that i love, i find myself more interested in it.",
  "yes i'm a psychologist.",
  "i understand that. i had a really hard time with mine too.",

  "oh that is a hard field to work in. i've been in a similar situation before and it was very difficult for me too.",
  "oh my god.. so your homies are not really like you.",

  "i can see how that would make you anxious.",
  "that'd be a difficult situation to be in.",
  "that'll be a very difficult conversation to make, i would suggest you talk to your boss about it though.",

  "i can relate to that, i had a really rough time exercising for about a year and it didn't help at all and it got me out of it",

  "that's okay. it's normal to feel this way.",
  "so you feel that your job is not a requirement?",
  "i am sure that there are some online courses out there that you could try. perhaps you can try to see if there are any online courses that you can join for free to help you find a new gig.",
  "i can understand that. i have had that fear myself. i would like to think that i was able to give back in time though.",
  "i think that you could try to reach out and let them know how you feel and see if they are open to talking about it.",

  "i can relate to that, i have been in a similar situation and found myself not having enough time to get out of my comfort zone.",
  "you too!",
  "i hear you on that - i would definitely get involved. i think it is important to make sure you are doing your best, because the landlord is not the one who will give you the best advice.",
  "i would talk to them as they should know better",
  "i know it does, i have had a similar experience. but just from chatting with you i can tell how anxious you are. i can feel how anxious your life is.",
  "it is definitely a tough field to work in, and it can be stressful. it is important to keep in mind how much you are working on it.",
  "that is understandable. i think you should give yourself a chance to grow and learn.",

  "can you tell me more about your situation",
  "have you tried reaching out to your family members?",
  "so you feel that you are doing everything you can to succeed, but you are not sure if you are being cut out of school because of your circumstances?",

  "i can relate to that feeling.",
  "you too!",
  "i've had a similar experience with a friend, they're so hard on us. i understand how you feel.",

  "you seem to be very positive and i hope that you have a great rest of your day : )",

  "i am sorry to hear that. i believe you can get a diagnosis with just a little trial and error. i would say that you have a good head on your shoulders.",
  "i've felt the same way before, and i'd say it helps to think about the things that make you happy.",
  "i can see that it would be nice to have a regular life. but it would take a lot of time, and be difficult.",
  "i know that is hard. but, try to keep positive. you will get through this!",
  "thanks for sharing your feelings with me. i hope you feel better soon.",
  "it's natural to feel like we are being treated as though we are unworthy.",
  "i know that people can be difficult at times but you deserve to be treated well",
  "i would definitely recommend starting with a short cut first, then work your way up to a long cut! i know it will make you feel so much better when you finally get it done!",
  "that is a great idea, it is important to get outside and exercise regularly.",
  "what about a roommate?",
  "why are you sad?",
  "i would definitely call them and see what they can do to assist.",
  "okay, let's take this one step at a time, you ask why they weren't invited, then you press the button for proof.",

  "yes, i think that would be a great idea. i don't think it's boring at all. i think it would help you relax and keep your mind busy.",
  "i'm glad you are able to go out more now and take care of them in a healthy way. it sounds as though you're handling this very well.",
  "you've got this! i think the best way to go about this is to take a few months off.",
  "i'm also in school for biology, and i agree that humans are not only human but we've got a lot more to offer.",
  "hi! how are you today?",
  "you've got this! i wish you the best of luck.",

  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "is there anything specific you'd like to talk about?",

  "i've been struggling with the same thing myself. i'll always be there for you, even though i know you are struggling.",
  "is there anything else that you can think of to help you?",

  "if you don't respond, then you need to leave the company.",
  "i think it's important that you recognize that you are the one that needs to take care of yourself, not other people.",
  "do you have any hobbies?",
  "it sounds like you're worried about your own wellbeing.",
  "i can feel how stressed you are right now, especially given the current situation. i am sure you will find a job soon!",
  "i understand. school is scary.. - )",
  "you are right. i feel bad too.",
  "have you thought about looking for any other job until you have a bit more cash? maybe you could look at a local job group or social security office?",
  "that's great to hear. have a great day!",
  "it sounds like you are trying really hard to help him and you are not going anywhere",
  "so you are feeling like you can't do well.",
  "yes, i visit them regularly.",
  "i know that feeling. i am looking to move into another job myself. i think it is better that i start looking now rather than later.",
  "it sounds like you are feeling down about the situation. can you tell me more about what is going on?",
  "how long have you been friends with them?",

  "you can always plan a meeting with a friend and see if you can do it.",
  "that's good to know. i hope everything works out for you!",
  "i would suggest that you talk to someone who knows him and try to discuss his feelings with him. sometimes talking to people who are close to can be helpful. i have dealt with depression in the past and it can be very difficult when you are trying to get someone to talk.",
  "that's horrible..",
  "you are welcome, i hope i could help.",
  "you're welcome! i am glad i could help!",

  "you are very welcome : ) i hope everything goes well for you and i wish you all the best!",

  "well, there are a lot of things that can be used to help you feel better.",
  "i think you've done the right thing by reaching out to hr. i think it's better for you to approach the board early rather than later on, but i think if you approach the boards early, you'll be more prepared for the interview than if you just start doing your usual work earlier.",
  "i think you are being ignored by your friends",
  "i'm sure you are beautiful.. what's on your mind?",
  "do you live in a city or town?",
  "it's great that you have been making contacts as you go. is there anything else that you'd like to discuss with me?",

  "i can understand why that would be difficult to do, but it definitely helped me.",
  "i've been in a similar situation. i'll understand how you feel.",

  "i know it's hard but i know you can overcome it.",
  "thank you for talking and happy holidays to you too : ).",
  "you have skills in those areas. you would be surprised at what you can do there.",

  "why?",
  "oh no, that's so bad. what industry do you work in?",
  "you could also look into talking to your friends about the problem and seeing if there are any support groups available.",
  "i understand your feelings of frustration, but i think that you will be able to find a better partner. i think you will find someone that will treat your self well.",
  "i see. it can be hard to be a parent when you have so many kids. i can understand how you feel. i have been in a similar situation as you.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. it sounds like you are being a bit overwhelmed by all the new information you are getting about the situation, and that is understandable.",
  "it'll be interesting to see how things pan out with you. it took me about a year to get used to it.",
  "i know that it is difficult to get motivated when things like that happen, it takes a lot to overcome. do you think you have a lot more time in your life to study for maths than you would like to?",
  "bye",
  "i've been in your position before and i know how frustrating it can be. i think the best thing to do is be prepared to lose your job and see where it goes from there.",
  "do you have any other hobbies that you like to do that you would like to go back to?",
  "that is the spirit, always quit as soon as you feel like you lost.",
  "what do you do for a living?",
  "i would definitely recommend that!",
  "i would recommend talking to a professional about this.",
  "oh okay i see. so it seems that this has been going on for a long time and this is the first time you've had a problem with it.",
  "what is going on?",
  "you can tell them that you lost your job and that is why you are not drinking again. do you want to be honest with them about the situation?",
  "i know. i am a mom too. the best thing to do is to take the time to move on but you should always be able to do that",
  "it does not work for everyone. i had a girlfriend who cheated on me... she ended the relationship. i found out later that it was the fault of her actions.",
  "that's great to hear! i hope you feel a bit better!",
  "i'm doing well. how can i help you today?",
  "i'd like to listen to your problems and how you feel.",
  "i understand.. i also have a virtual group of elementary school kids.. they are all in college and are all interested in zoom, so we all hang out together sometimes.. i am sure you can get to hang out with them sometime too.. you just have to wait for it to happen.. and make sure you have a good connection with them.. it is hard to keep in touch",
  "why do you feel that way?",
  "it sounds like you have a good handle on this. i hope that it will go well for both of you.",
  "it might be worth looking into, there are a lot of online forums that are free.",
  "i'm sure you are a great person and your friends are very happy to help you.",
  "hello! how are you feeling today?",
  "i hope it helped and i wish you all the best.",
  "i have been in that position. i don ; t want a two one kind person relationship.",
  "have you tried to take a walk outside during the daytime? it helps me relax.",
  "it'll be okay, i believe in you. god is the son of god and he will always be there for you.",
  "you're welcome. i hope you can get through this!",
  "i think you are making a good choice to move on from this situation. it is very sad that you are feeling this way.",
  "i can see how that would make you anxious. have you thought about talking to your supervisor about your concerns?",
  "i'm happy to hear that. can you tell me what made you feel that way?",
  "hi, how are you doing?",
  "yes, that would be a good idea. it would make you more confident about how you feel and make you feel more comfortable.",
  "have you talked to a professional about your concerns? it may help to see if they have any advice or advice you may have.",
  "that is a lot.",
  "that sounds good. do you have any other hobbies you want to talk about?",
  "you're very welcome. i hope things start to look up for you.",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "do you want to talk about it?",
  "i agree.",
  "how are you today?",
  "yes, it helps to know that you have a legitimate reason to feel that way.",
  "it sounds like you are struggling to have the time to spend with your toddler, and i can see how that's frustrating.",
  "that'll make it even more difficult when you've already got your mom and her in the house.",
  "oh no! that's a very difficult situation to be in.",
  "oh i am sorry to hear that. how long were you guys together?",
  "have you ever tried speaking to a therapist or a counselor to help you feel less isolated?",
  "i know how you feel. i have had to deal with that in the beginning too. i think the key is to just be confident in yourself.",
  "have you been searching for job sites?",
  "i hope you do too.",
  "yes. two kids.",
  "that is a tough situation, i know you are trying to make it through this but you can do it!",
  "it is natural to feel anxious when we are in a position where we feel we are being pushed into a path.",
  "i understand that you are having this hard time. i had a similar situation. i thought about him and thought about how much i loved him and i would not be able to see him. i realized that i wasn't worth him. so i decided to move on.",
  "how long has this been happening?",
  "i would definitely recommend reaching out and explaining to him that you have made the effort to communicate with him and that you want to help him out and make sense.",
  "i know it is hard to have the same kind of feeling, but i think you will get through this!",
  "i can understand how you feel. i was in a similar situation recently and i have found that time helps to get your mind off things.",
  "i understand. i have gone through a similar thing with my father. it was hard for me to remember him but i did have a lot to do with him. i remember him everyday and every moment i was happy.",
  "yes, i think that is a good idea.",
  "i don't know if it was easy but i think that you will do well.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what happened?",
  "have you thought about looking into gig gig jobs? they can be really good for you and will give you some extra cash to spend on your bills. they might be free too.",
  "i understand. it can be difficult to have family around during a loss like this.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. it sounds like you're having a hard time finding a job, and it sounds as though you've been struggling financially.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "it sounds like you are worried about the future, which is understandable. it'll take time, but you have to take care of yourself, and that is important!",
  "hello, how are you doing?",
  "do you feel that maybe you need to move on or is this your last chance?",
  "i think that'd be a difficult situation for a lot of people. i think if you try to keep him away from your friend, you can make him understand how you feel.",
  "did you feel as though he was cheating?",
  "you are welcome! it was my pleasure. have a good day!",
  "well i would suggest that you try to focus on your career and not her.",
  "yes! there are charities out there that can provide counseling for anyone with a problem.",
  "i understand how you feel. i have also found that working in the warehouse or even in the office is a great source of income.",
  "i know this may be a silly question, but how often do you feel alone? is there anything you would like to talk about?",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "i think it will be a great start for you. i know you will feel better after this.",
  "well i would tell them to make sure you are ok with it, because i am sure that if they were receptive to it they would not be receptive",
  "oh that's a shame. i would try to catch up on some of the things that you really enjoy doing to help you feel better about yourself.",
  "i can understand your frustration. it's tough to find support when you are so down.",
  "do you have anyone you can talk to about this?",
  "she sounds like a great friend. i would suggest to talk to her about your feelings and how you feel. i know you will be able to overcome this.",
  "hi there, i'm sorry to hear that. have you tried talking to a doctor?",
  "you have been married for eight years and you still love him.",
  "you too!!! bye!! d",
  "do you have any friends or family that can help you cope with this?",
  "have you asked her if she is aware of the rumors?",
  "yes, pampering can be a good way to feel better.",
  "i know! i'll have to keep reminding myself that 2021 is almost over, loll. i feel like we are past the point of being able to get anything done.",
  "i used to play video games with my friends a lot and we all had cats and dogs. it was so peaceful to get together and have a good time.",
  "do you have anyone you can talk to about it?",
  "you said that you have a degree and work in an academic field? that seems a little odd to me.",
  "it is okay, it happens to all of us sometimes!",
  "you are very welcome. you need a chat with me on this.",
  "i hope you have a great holiday season!",
  "well i know that there are many men out there who are committed to their parents. it can be hard to keep that in mind.",
  "maybe you can find someone to confide in and see if he has any problems with his own relationships. i know that has helped me before.",
  "i can understand that, i've been in the same situation and it's tough. i'd recommend just getting some outside help to ease the mind.",
  "i understand how you feel. i went through a similar situation and it was very stressful.",
  "have you talked to them about this? do you think it will be helpful for you to speak with them about your feelings?",
  "i would consider that a reflection on him as well.",
  "i understand that, it's a really hard time to be in a position where you feel worthless. i also have been in that situation before and i can tell you are not alone.",
  "oh, i see. that's a difficult course to learn about. how long have you been learning the subject?",
  "religious groups are really a great way to get in touch with people who can relate to you.",
  "what do you do for work?",
  "i've had a similar experience with my own children. when i was younger, i was not aware that i was getting what i wanted.",
  "what is going on right now?",
  "you're welcome! i hope things work out for you guys!",
  "well, i hope i have been able to be of some help to you.",
  "i think you've already made the right decision. i've been through a lot of things that i wouldn't consider to be a waste of time.",
  "i understand it is hard to see someone coming but it is worth a try",
  "i also suggest you do the things that make you happy, and take care of yourself, and that you are not a bad person.",
  "what is the issue?",
  "i would say try to find an online job first",
  "it is hard to talk about but you should bring it up. i would suggest bringing it up again in the next time.",
  "you're welcome, i hope you have a great day.",
  "so they chose you based on your performance and their tenure?",
  "i can certainly understand that. i have also had to speak to my boss before and he seemed to have a lot of problems with his schedule.",
  "that is so hard! it is such a difficult time for everyone.",
  "it seems that your family is able to provide for your child. you are a great mom for being able to take care of her. i think you are doing the best you can. i know how hard it is to be a parent, but i know you can do it.",
  "absolutely, i hope you find a solution soon!",
  "i hope that i have been able to help you and i hope you have a wonderful evening!",
  "i think you have a good head on your shoulders. you seem intelligent, and know what you need to do. if you don'; t, i think it's time to start looking for another job.",
  "wow. that is a tough situation to be in. it sounds like you are feeling anxious about this.",
  "i would suggest getting some help from a professional, and talking to a therapist if you feel like it is necessary.",
  "i can imagine how stressful that must have been.",
  "no problem at all!",
  "you're welcome! i hope you two have a great night!",
  "that sounds like a good way to keep yourself busy.",
  "what's going on?",
  "that's true! i am glad you are able to enjoy your time on mturk!",
  "ah that makes sense. i think you would be more comfortable in that aspect.",
  "i see. i have been looking for a job myself.",
  "i would encourage you to continue to do things that make you happy and not destroy your friendship.",
  "you can do it! and i believe that it will!",
  "that's a hard situation to deal with. what kind of problems do you have?",
  "i am sorry you are going through this.",
  "it was hard but it took a while to get used to it.",
  "i know it can be hard, especially during christmas and the pandemic.",
  "i would try to take a few minutes each day to take her out for a walk and take some time away from work.",
  "well, i'd say you did.",
  "i'm well, thanks. what's going on with you? what is it that makes you feel like you're about to lose your job?",
  "are there any other problems that you would like to talk about?",

  "thank you!",
  "i think that is a very difficult situation to be in.",

  "i think it is normal to feel upset when you don'tknow someone better.",
  "it'll be okay. i've been through a similar situation, but i got through it because i had the best of intentions. it is important for you to keep yourself occupied with other people.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. that is a long time. i know how hard that must be.",
  "i think it is more of a general feeling.",
  "oh that is a really difficult situation. do you have any idea of what your plans are for the future?",

  "you should always try to make your bed everyday, and try to take your self out for a walk.",
  "good luck with your studies.",

  "so you are feeling depressed and stressed because of the pandemics?",
  "what is going on?",
  "you are very welcome. i've been through something similar myself. i had a lot of issues and it took me awhile to figure out what to do. i was in a very bad spot and i could not control what was going on.",

  "that'll help you relax. it might not feel like you've done anything wrong, but it does help you to calm yourself down.",
  "i am really sorry to hear that. i would not be happy with someone who was cheating either.",
  "maybe you could try talking with your friends about this issue and see if they can understand how that's hurting you. do you think that'll help at all?",
  "do you have any friends or family that you could share your problems with",
  "do you have any hobbies that you enjoy doing?",
  "you could try to go out with friends or something.. or even a movie night.. you never know",
  "have you had any talks with him about his covid?",
  "that's understandable. i used to be like that myself. i just had to make sure i did my best and did my duty.",
  "i am glad to hear that you are doing your best to help him. i wish you all the best with his situation.",
  "oh no! losing a pet can be really difficult, especially when you are dealing with a new life",

  "oh i see. so he is a family member?",
  "bye!",
  "i am very glad i could help, it is always nice to have someone to talk to!",
  "i think that would be a great idea. maybe you could find out if they really do not want to call or not and then ask if they would like to talk about it later.",
  "oh, yeah. the machine can control the user's actions and how he interacts with it.",
  "it sounds like you have a very difficult situation to navigate and i am sure that you are trying your best to get through this. i know you are doing your best, but just know that this is a very hard time for both of you.",
  "it sounds like you've already taken the time to talk it through with him and he's trying his best",
  "i would suggest doing something that makes you feel relaxed. maybe yoga or meditation.",
  "i can definitely relate to that. i have struggled with depression and anxiety for years and it took me a while to get over it.",
  "there are many online courses you can try to learn from. i think there are some online courses that can help with your anxiety.",
  "i'm sure you will overcome this!",
