  "i had fun but i also found it hard to go out and spend time with people i loved.",
  "i think you may be having some anxieties and not being able to sleep as well as you used to. have you tried any other methods that might help you?",

  "i see.. so you are going to spend time with them and be yourself?",
  "you'll be fine.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. that is a really tough situation.",
  "i think that is a great idea. what kind of work do you have in mind?",
  "i am doing good, what is on your mind?",

  "you are welcome. i hope that i have been able to be of some help and i wish you luck in the future.",
  "hello. how are you doing today?",

  "it's important to make sure that you're working from home and that you have your own time. do you feel that your partner is not being enough?",
  "i would look into some online classes and maybe a book that you can read to help you get through your exam.",

  "well, i am sure your boss will understand",
  "i would try and talk to your manager about it. if they are not able to help, maybe you could try to talk with your manager to see if they can help?",

  "you're welcome",
  "have you thought about moving back home to the country where you are now?",

  "yes i understand. i think it is important to communicate with people when you are feeling down.",
  "is there anything you'd like to talk about today?",
  "you can press quit and then i will be done.",
  "i see, perhaps there is something in the way you feel that is affecting your mood, maybe a counselor could help you with that.",

  "i understand your frustration and it must make you feel lonely.",

  "bye",
  "i am very sorry to hear that. is there anything else you have done in the past that would make you feel anxious?",
  "so you are feeling nervous about the test and feeling that you failed it?",
  "i am confident that they will be able too - it is definitely a difficult time to be in a position to give up on yourself.",
  "i think she would understand if you texted first",
  "you are going through a rough time and i am sure you are feeling a bit overwhelmed.",
  "well for example i took some online classes on how to make money and make it into a career, i didn't know how to put together a list of things to buy, i just put them together, then i took one class to make it work and it took me about ten minutes to make the full one, i then went back and did the rest, i made it through the class and it was really helpful.",
  "i'd be really concerned if he was abusive to you, but that doesn'thing he would change. it sounds like you're really trying your best to get through this.",

  "you are welcome.",
  "wow! that'll make you feel like you are doing your part to help garbo out!! i'll bet she loves that!",
  "it sounds like it might be a good fit. i hope you can find something that works for you.",
  "i understand. you need to focus on your daily tasks and your days to get yourself to do them. you have to work hard to keep yourself busy.",
  "that is an unusual situation, do you have any idea what your company is going through?",
  "i can understand how upset you are. have you thought about just letting your dog go and asking her if she wanted to go alone?",
  "good luck with that.. hope you can get out in the big picture and get away from the chaos and mess that has created.",
  "that sounds like a difficult time for you. it sounds like you are very concerned about the safety of your children and their safety.",
  "i think you'd like to work from home then.",
  "i can understand how frustrating that must be. i have had managers who have been so different that they can't stand to hear the truth.",
  "how are things with you? is it a cold or something bad?",
  "yes, i have. i have felt that i could never be happy or happy. it was never easy, but i found that it was worth it.",
  "you too!",
  "yes, it does. i think it is normal to feel that they feel that way.",
  "are you doing your masters degree in a country with strict rules?",
  "i understand. i've had to do this before. it can be really difficult.",
  "hi how are you today?",
  "your fiancé is sick as well as being ill",
  "i understand that, i am also in the same boat. what kind of toys do you want to get your kids?",
  "that sounds like a really good idea!",
  "i talked to my loved ones about how i was feeling and how i felt alone and that it was making me feel as though i had no one to talk to. i tried to talk about the things that make me feel comfortable and that i could help others.",
  "oh i'm sorry to hear that. what is it you are feeling down about?",
  "i have been in a similar situation myself. i had a very bad experience with my ex boyfriend of 3 years. it took a lot of courage to get to know him. i didn'tknow him personally until he moved away. it was a very difficult time for me and it was really hard for him.",
  "it sounds like you're doing what is best for yourself. i believe you'll find a great career out there.",
  "that is certainly difficult to deal with. you have to be strong to do what you think is right, but you should be able to stand up for yourself.",
  "bye",
  "that is really gross. i can't imagine how hard that must have been.",
  "ok, let's talk about this",
  "of course! i find that a lot of people are unable to. i am hoping that your patience with the situation will help you get through this.",
  "i can relate to that feeling. i have done it before and i was very upset, but i found that it helped me get over it.",
  "i am also excited for those! i think it's great that we have christmas traditions.",
  "i think you are motivated and your trying hard.",
  "i agree. i am glad i could help you.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i have been through a similar thing in the past. i was able to get out of my funk after awhile and find a new hobby.",
  "i understand that you feel anxious and stressed about the situation, but i think you can handle it.",
  "that'sn't fair. i've had neighbors like that before too. i think you should be glad you were able to get your dog, and that you did something right.",
  "you are welcome. have a wonderful day!",
  "you're welcome!",
  "yes, it will. i wish you all the best.",
  "it sounds like you are trying your best. i think you will be successful.",
  "yes. i agree.",
  "it sounds like you are doing great.",
  "yeah it is hard to see all the changes in our lives in a month.",
  "oh i see. it is really hard when we're not being able to make out, even if we want to.",
  "yes, i'm sorry to hear this. i think you should take your mind off it and think about how to make it better.",
  "have you tried talking to her about it?",
  "it sounds like you have a lot going on in your life right now, so i'd recommend taking a few breaks from the activity you've always wanted to do. maybe take some time to think about things you'd like to do, like reading, playing with animals, or doing something else you'll enjoy doing more.",
  "i understand that feeling, it is hard to see our family members when we have so much trouble. i think you are being very selfcentered and caring for them. you are doing a great job, i think that you are making a positive impact on them.",
  "i can imagine how difficult that would make you feel.",
  "you too!",
  "i am doing well. how can i help you today?",
  "i am sure you will be fine. i know the feeling of not knowing how to make money, but at least you have a safe place to be.",
  "i am good. how can i help you today?",
  "what sort of pets do you own?",
  "i understand how difficult that must be for you. have you been able to get your resume together and look for another job?",
  "lol... well, i'll be glad to help if i can!",
  "it sounds like you are feeling down about your loss.",
  "i hope that i have been able to have helped you in any way i can, and i wish you all the very best in the future!",
  "what kind of classes are you taking?",
  "if you don'think you did anything wrong, then it is totally natural that you would want to talk about it. it is not like you are fighting for her, you are talking to someone else and they might not be able to help.",
  "i would start looking for jobs in your field, like in your major or your local field.",
  "of course, i wish you all the best!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i know that it can be difficult to deal with.",
  "do you think you could consider trying to get some new hobbyfriends? maybe just talking to them while you are there might help you with the loneliness.",
  "how are you?",
  "just remind them that they are not the same. they are different. they can still live with mommy and dad.",
  "i see. so you want an academic degree in excel?",
  "that sounds like a great idea! what kind of talents do you have?",
  "you are very welcome. i hope things start to improve for you soon.",
  "what is going on?",
  "have a great life ahead too!",
  "have you tried any other ways to get your attention and make yourself feel better?",
  "you are so welcome, i am glad you are feeling better.",
  "i understand. it has been hard for me too, but i know that it'll pass.",
  "well, you don'feel comfortable saying anything to your boss about it?",
  "that's great! is there anything else i can help you with today? maybe we can talk about how you are feeling?",
  "it sounds as though you have the right attitude about it and are looking for a better job.",
  "i am glad to hear that you are seeking help and that you have a solution. i think you will do great.",
  "hello. how are you?",
  "what career did you switch?",
  "you could try doing some online activities such as playing games with friends.",
  "i understand how you feel. it is a rough time for many people, especially in the pandemic.",
  "i can imagine, i would feel the same way.",
  "so it seems like you were putting your self first in order to make sure that she would be able to be a good support system?",
  "you as well!",
  "i have struggled with depression before. i had to seek out professional help for it.",
  "i've had friends do that to me too. i think that sometimes friends can be difficult to be around.",
  "i hope you find something that works for you too.",
  "how are you feeling?",
  "thank you! i'll be sure to let you know how it goes!",
  "that'll be a tough situation to resolve but i think you're right. i've had friends that made me sad and upset too.",
  "how are you feeling today?",
  "i would do that, take some classes and see what your best choice is.",
  "maybe you can look into a new hobby or activity you enjoy? there are plenty of free online courses that you could try.",
  "i hope i have been able to be of some help to you today.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "you've already moved on. you have learned a lesson. you deserve someone more than this guy.",
  "perhaps you could take a few minutes and talk to someone at home who could provide you with some support?",
  "do you have anyone in your family that can help you out?",
  "i have heard that there are some things out here to try to get your sleeping pattern in a better shape and try to keep it in better order.",
  "i am good. what are you doing?",
  "thanks for talking.",
  "how are you feeling now?",
  "you've got this!",
  "i know it can be hard to work harder, but remember that you've got this!",
  "i can relate to that. i'd try to find a group activity that doesn'ter you. if you can find one that helps, then you'll have a lot more success.",
  "oh no that is awful. i know how it feels to be treated that way.",
  "i was a yoga instructor, and i enjoyed reading and doing yoga.",
  "do you have any siblings or friends that you could reach out to?",
  "i am available. i am in charge of finding time to attend.",
  "have you tried to explain to your other coworker that your cocoworker is being aggressive?",
  "i've been good. thank you for asking.",
  "hi! how are you doing today?",
  "i understand that. i have had a similar fear. i think that is the root cause of anxiety and depression.",
  "i am sure you will get it soon",
  "it sounds as though this is affecting you more than it should.",
  "that's great that you tested positive! i am glad you are able to get some relief from this stress reliever",
  "it's really not that bad though. it'll take some time for him to forgive himself. i can tell you that it'd be a terrible thing to do to someone else though.",
  "i've been there, it is hard. how long ago did you lose your job?",
  "well, i do understand that. it's tough to be around people who aren't as supportive as you",
  "that'sounds like a really good idea. have you thought about seeing someone new?",
  "i would say talk to the cotherapist or some sort of counselor. it would be a good starting point.",
  "have you considered reaching out to a friend to help you communicate with her?",
  "i think she might be feeling overwhelmed by how much she's making you feel and that'll cause her to be upset.",
  "you are very welcome. i'm happy i could help.",
  "i've been thinking about a big dog like a yorkie or a chihuahua. they are such good friends.",
  "i am glad you are here",
  "oh no. i am sorry to hear that. is this something that has happened recently?",
  "its hard to see things from a distance, but once you get used to it, things will be better. trust me, i know you will get through this.",
  "i understand! you just need to take care of yourself and not feel guilty for anything!",
  "thank you!!!",
  "what seems to be bothering you today? is there something you'd like to talk about?",
  "you too, good luck.",
  "have you tried to get some exercise?",
  "i can completely understand how that is difficult for you. it seems like you are a great friend and you are trying your best to keep your friendship",
  "i can understand that feeling... i have had this happen to me and it is very difficult",
  "i have had friends that would hide their feelings when confronted. it's difficult to be able to do that when they aren't listening to you.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what has been going on?",
  "i've had a similar experience with a partner before, and it can make you feel like you're not being able to be with the person anymore. it can be hard to find someone who you feel comfortable with.",
  "i definitely recommend getting some good rest and eating well, i find it helps me to eat healthy too",
  "yeah, especially since you have a lot to do during the day. you can't just take the day off, though.",
  "it sounds like you are really upset that you aren't getting to spend time with your own friends. you are not being whiny or paranoid.",
  "what kind of work do you do?",
  "that is a good question. what would you say the criteria of success is?",
  "i am a real one, i have been doing virtual work in my spare time.",
  "have you tried to practice with other people?",
  "you can only hope. i know it can be difficult when you're on good feet, but you can also make it work.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i can relate to how you are feeling.",
  "i am okay, thanks. what's been on your mind?",
  "it sounds like you are trying to find a new job and it is making you feel low.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. are they older?",
  "i can understand how that would make you feel. it is hard to move on from something you have invested so much time into.",
  "i hope you are able to do that!",
  "if he does not commit fully, then what would he do?",
  "i agree, it is a great way to get through a situation. i am sure you will do great in the future.",
  "i'm well, how are things going with you? what is on your mind?",
  "what are some of your skills you are interested in?",
  "i am glad to hear it. i wish you all the best in your future.",
  "that sounds like a great idea, travel is always fun.",
  "i understand. i've had to be a bit of a quitter myself when it comes to that kind of stuff, and it's been a real tough time for me.",
  "you should make new friends, because you will be more social",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what's going on?",
  "ah i see, so you're worried about them?",
  "i know how you feel. i have been in a similar situation before.",
  "hello! how are you doing today?",
  "i'm glad to hear that. i hope you can find something to look forward to!",
  "it sounds like you've had a rough year with a friend you really care about.",
  "i've had my fair share of people tell me that i am not very motivated and i'll only write about things that i enjoy.",
  "that is a tough spot to be in. i would definitely try and make sure that you are able to talk to her about it and see if she would be willing to consider doing something differently.",
  "no, i am not saying that at all. i am saying that you could get rid off doug, and that you can get rid from this relationship as you would any other partner. you can still find someone who loves you.",
  "do you ever think about going out for lunch, or a movie?",
  "you can try to be more careful next time because you don't want to be in trouble",
  "you can try to talk to them..",
  "i understand how hard it is for you and how hard you are trying to cope with this. it is hard to be in that situation and know how to get over it. you have to figure out what works for you, and if you can't work on that then you should try to find a new hobby or something to help you overcome your depression.",
  "do you feel like you have a better understanding of what is making you feel this way?",
  "i would suggest you take the time to talk to a professional, i would recommend doing that if you can afford it.",
  "why are you feeling frustrated?",
  "i hope that things get better for you and that you can find a peace of mind with your ex.",
  "oh i see. i know that there are many charities that offer support for people who are in a hard time.",
  "i think you should use a cover letter to get a feel for your resume.",
  "it'll be easy, but i think you will feel better.",
  "ah, that sounds like a great idea. i would also like to go back to school after this pandemicacy has ended.",
  "i hope it helps you feel better. i think you need to start feeling better, so you can try to move on.",
  "that's great! i hope you feel better soon.",
  "well i think that it will too - it was a bad year but we will get through it",
  "do you think that you can talk to your boss about your feelings?",
  "i hope so as well. i really hope that you will be able to find some help.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. it sounds like you really need to be with your family to recover from this.",
  "i understand that, it is hard to have that kind of financial support during a tough time.",
  "i understand, i also have had to go through similar situation, but it was very helpful to me.",
  "i'm bob, my therapist and the helper of christmas night",
  "yes it is, but it is a good thing, your friends can help you if you need it",
  "i have had issues with the stimulus checks, but not with the gift card.",
  "have you tried to talk to her about the feelings you are feeling?",
  "i am glad i could help you. i wish you luck and your future.",
  "i am doing well, how are things with you today?",
  "it is nice to be able to go out and do something you enjoy doing. i hope you do too. god will not give you a gift that is not good enough",
  "do you think that your children would be interested in the exercise?",
  "oh wow! cheese curd sounds like a great idea!",
  "i am feeling depressed due to the pandemic",
  "you too : ).",
  "i am glad you feel better.",
  "i hope you get your feelings out of her.",
  "i think that you should be proud of yourself and be confident that you did nothing wrong.",
  "hello! how are you doing?",
  "well, its not easy but it is worth it.",
  "of course! i hope you all have a wonderful holiday season!",
  "group studies can be really helpful too",
  "wow. i would be so upset too.",
  "i'm sorry to here about that.",
  "have you tried any online tutor groups or online study groups?",
  "you as well!",
  "i think that would be a good idea, i think it would help you calm down a little",
  "that is great! it sounds like you are a great employee and are working hard for your future.",
  "i would recommend mts scripts for that. they can also help you find hits that you are really interested in.",
  "oh wow i am sorry to hear that. i think there is some free clinics online that could help her if she wants to go.",
  "you have a lot going on right now, but you have to take the time to think about your future and your relationship.",
  "i am so happy to hear that. please know that you have done nothing wrong!",
  "you are welcome.",
  "i would suggest trying to write a short story or something, then perhaps you could write about something else.",
  "i know it can be difficult, but it is important to be patient. you are a good parent, and i am glad that you have your children.",
  "that is wonderful! i am glad that you are taking care of your dog and that you can take care of him when he needs to go. it will be tough, but i am sure you will find someone who is truly loving and kind.",
  "i've felt the same way in the past. how do you feel about this?",
  "yes, it has made me feel better to talk about it.",
  "i can understand your frustration. when i was in a similar situation, i found myself wearing a lot of different clothes. i tried to help her and she understood.",
  "bye",
  "i see. so you are a member of a group of people who have been through a lot of hard times, and are trying to get through this as best as possible? i do not have a lot to say about how i feel, but i do understand how difficult this is for you.",
  "thank you, you too!",
  "you are not alone in feeling that way.",
  "oh that's so sweet. volunteering is a great thing to do.",
  "i can tell that you are feeling a bit overwhelmed by this situation and want to let go of it.",
  "i would bring it to him.",
  "i can relate to that, it took me over three years to be able to move on from a relationship. i found out that it was because i had been with someone for so long.",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. i've been in a similar situation. it's hard to cope when someone you love breaks up with you.",
  "i hope that i helped you. i am glad that i could help.",
  "that makes sense. sometimes we just need to vent and take the time to do things that we enjoy doing.",
  "what is making you anxious?",
  "you are welcome, i am glad i could help",
  "you are not as anxiety on video but it is still difficult to do it in person.",
  "yes, it was free. i took it out of my pocket and put it towards my skilling set. you could even do that online too.",
  "have you tried taking some deep breaths to help your mind reenergate? that'll help me to be more aware of things happening around me.",
  "i hope that i have been able to help. i am glad that i could be of some help.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i would suggest talking to someone who knows you well and who you can trust. even if they don't know you well, it may be worth a shot.",
  "i understand that. i've struggled with that myself. have you tried contacting a friend or family member for help?",
  "i think that would be a great first step, and i think she would appreciate that as well!",
  "you are a hands - on student, how does that make you feel?",
  "i've been in your shoes before. i know how hard it can be to find a job when there are so many opportunities out there!",
  "do you know how long it has been happening?",
  "sounds like that's the spirit! it'll be fun to take a day or two off, just to take your mind off of things.",
  "i'm glad to hear it. what seems to be making you feel this way?",
  "i hope i have helped. i know how hard it is to be in this tough time. i think you will do great!",
  "you've done your part to make sure that you don't end up hurting your family and friends. you deserve better than that.",
  "it sounds like you have a strong resolve to this, which is something that i've found helpful in the past.",
  "i think you can look at this as a reflection of yourself. i believe you are worthy of being treated as though you are completely cut off.",
  "i am really glad to hear that you have found something to help!",
  "do you feel like you can provide your own time off to yourself?",
  "is there any particular reason you are feeling overwhelmed?",
  "i understand that, it can be very tough to get a job right now. have you considered looking for a job in the future?",
  "oh i am sorry to hear that",
  "what happened with your son?",
  "you can also look into the tivational services available in your country such as amazon and other websites. you may find them helpful.",
  "i would be afraid too. i think if you are staying with your family and your boyfriend wants to move and leave earlier then it is a good thing to talk to them about it",
  "i've been in your shoes before. it can be a challenging time.",
  "oh i see. i know that there are many different types of migraine attacks.",
  "i think that that is a very difficult situation to be in.",
  "do you think you can try to find a new hobby or hobby to spend time with her?",
  "how does that make you feel?",
  "that sounds great! do you feel that you have any other options? there are some great resources out there like craigslist or ebay that might be able to help you find something.",
  "i've been in a similar position before. i had to learn a lot about how to make money and how to find work. it took a lot of work but i eventually found a job and found a better one.",
  "well you could always look into doing something like that with other people or possibly even with your partner. i know it can be very hard to move on from this situation, but you may be able too.",
  "do you have anyone close to you who you can talk to about this?",
  "is there anything you can do to try and help her?",
  "it sounds like you have a lot on your plate.",
  "have you tried talking to them via facetime? it may be a good way to connect with them.",
  "oh i see. so he didn't get sick at home? that sounds really tough, especially considering how he works from home",
  "try doing yoga",
  "it sounds like you are very thoughtful and caring.",
  "well it is a natural medication that is made by the brain. it is in a pill form that is regulated by the government.",
  "i am so glad i could be of help.",
  "yes it is. i think it's very useful.",
  "you too : ) have a great day!",
  "i write a journal every morning and it helps me keep my mind busy and keep my thoughts off of my kids",
  "that is understandable. you are still young and still trying to make yourself happy. you will get through this!",
  "it sounds like you are trying really hard, and i think that is a great thing to try.",
  "you could always put your feelings first if you're feeling comfortable.",
  "that sounds difficult. i know it must be very difficult to see someone you care about so deeply. i hope that you can make a plan to approach it in person sometime, even though it might not be easy.",
  "that's a great idea. it'll help you feel better about yourself.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what is causing your depression?",
  "that sounds reasonable.",
  "have you thought of possibly trying to find some work related activities that you enjoy doing?",
  "you are very welcome! have a wonderful night!",
  "it's definitely a tough time, but i believe you can overcome it.",
  "how can i help?",
  "i'm so sorry, i can tell how anxious you are.",
  "i used to be really close with my best friend when i had to lose my mom. i would just focus on the positive things and try to remember that this was a good time to be together.",
  "i can definitely understand how you feel. i have also been through that myself.",
  "i understand. i have had to be through this a few times myself - i know it can be very stressful at times.",
  "hello there, i am doing well. how are things going for you today?",
  "oh, i see. is that a large screen you have?",
  "okay, tell us about the problem.",
  "i have had to tell my friends i was unhappy when they acted like this.",
  "i have been in similar situations with my parents and they take it very seriously.",
  "what are your hobbiesinterests?",
  "i do too. i have a lovely sunset and a nice fall day to. i think it helps me to feel less anxious about things.",
  "that'll take time, i know it's hard right now, but i think you will find your happiness soon",
  "i am sure that you will be better than this.",
  "that sounds like a great idea",
  "that sounds like it would be a great opportunity to talk to her about your cousin's condition. if she is still able to live with you, i think you're doing a wonderful job for her.",
  "i understand that. sometimes it is best to just let the emotions out.",
  "that's a good point.",
  "i hope you can find a great group and i hope your family is happy.",
  "i hope i have been able to be of some help to you, and i wish you well in your future endeavors.",
  "you're welcome! i hope that you can overcome this and find a new partner soon!",
  "that'sn't a bad idea! i am glad you are able to stay healthy and stay strong!",
  "you are very welcome. i hope that i have helped!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. is there something specific that is making you feel this way?",
  "if you have any other questions feel free to reach out",
  "have you ever considered talking to a therapist about this? sometimes it'll help to talk through what happened and sometimes you can start to feel better about yourself.",
  "i can understand how you are feeling. i went through something similar and it was really hard on me.",
  "if you want to be a good friend, you need a good person in your life, that doesn't mean you have to be kind to someone you don'think is kind to you.",
  "you'are very welcome! i hope you have a great day and stay safe!",
  "do you have any other job that you would like to get back in touch with?",
  "i can understand how stressful that must feel to have to cope with all of this. do you think you can make a living doing this?",
  "i understand that it is hard to find friends when you are feeling lonely.",
  "i have, but i was able to do it again this summer and it was very nice.",
  "i feel like that too. when i think about how much i miss being a parent, i feel empty.",
  "i am sorry to hear that.",
  "it sounds like you are having a great time with your work, and that shows you are very interested in helping people in need.",
  "i can understand that. it's a difficult situation to be in, especially with such a big budget. have you considered reaching out to your advisor to see if they can help?",
  "i would ask them why, and see if they have any reason why they can't trust you.",
  "it sounds like you're frustrated at your child's lack of education. is that correct?",
  "you should not have an issue. just try to be positive and keep yourself safe.",
  "what is the problem?",
  "you are welcome. have a great day.",
  "so you feel isolated due to the holidays?",
  "that'll definitely make you feel better about it. what do you think you'll do with your time?",
  "that is a great idea! i am not sure that would be a good fit for you though. perhaps you could move to a city or state where you can have a more permanent career?",
  "is there anything you'd like to talk about?",
  "i know it is hard when you have to take care of a family member, but it will help you feel better",
  "you too!",
  "i think you should try to get some help with that. if you are doing your best to not let it get to you, it'll help you get through this!",
  "absolutely! it will help you to get through this and make you feel better",
  "what would you say your bad experience is?",
  "i can relate to that, and it can be stressful to work with such a large load on your thesis.",
  "if you are feeling low, you should take a deep breath and take deep breaths. you will feel better.",
  "you're welcome. i hope you have a great night.",
  "i'd definitely try that, i know deep breathing can be helpful.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, and yes it definitely is. i know it can be hard to keep yourself occupied when you are pandemifying.",
  "i am doing well. what is going on with you? i am sorry you are having a bad day.",
  "have you tried asking her if she is okay with that?",
  "i have been in a similar situation before and i found that the most helpful thing was finding a job that was offered by the company.",
  "that is great, it sounds like you've got the basics down.",
  "i've had a similar experience with a coworker. i think you deserve a chance to be valued and treated with respect and that you deserve the same respect as someone who doesn't treat you that way, which is what we all feel.",
  "it'll definitely help you get a better understanding of the subject.",
  "i am sure that you will find someone to talk with soon.",
  "bye",

  "i hope you'll be able to do the best you can!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, how long ago was this?",

  "i think writing it down is great. i think that would help you to write down things that will help you feel better.",
  "can you quit and you take the quiz?",

  "hello, how are you doing?",

  "that'll be a great start! i hope you feel better soon : ).",
  "i think that is a good way to approach it.",
  "you too!",
  "well, there are a few different things that can be used to help you, but i would recommend doing something like meditation, yoga, or even yoga with your family",
  "i think it depends on how much work you put in. if you put it all into one class, you could have a small break for one class. if i am doing it, then i would put it in a separate class, like one for each class and another for one, then you can just leave it at that one class until you are done with that one, and then when you're done with the next, you will be able to have the rest of the rest.",

  "i am so sorry to hear that. i know it is really hard to deal with, but i believe you will find something. you can do it!",
  "you are very welcome. i hope i have been able to help. i wish you the best in the future.",
  "i know this is a tough time but please take care of yourself and your health",
  "are you close to anyone?",
  "no problem : ) have a wonderful day!",
  "i am glad i could help. i know that it can feel lonely at first, but it can also be very liberating.",
  "it'll be okay, i wish you all the best in the future!",
  "well, a good haircut is always the best solution. and i know you are feeling a little down but it is totally natural. you never know what might come out of the blue!",
  "it'll be great to hear how your family is feeling about things. it sounds like you are trying hard.",
  "i see. you are dealing with this in a way that makes you feel lonely.",
  "hi, i'm sorry to hear that. what's going on?",

  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "you've been very welcome. thank you for the compliment!",
  "that'sounds like a great idea. i think you are going to feel much better when you open up and start writing again!",
  "i totally understand. have you ever tried to talk to your friends about it? it can help to have a conversation about what you are struggling with.",
  "i have been trying to get back into the gym as well, but i am finding it difficult to get motivated even if i want to do it.",
  "i would definitely recommend that! i know it sounds like it doesn't sound like you've been getting in trouble, but it can be difficult to lose touch with someone you care about.",
  "i'm here to listen, what's going on?",
  "oh, i can see how that would make you feel.",
  "so you are upset with him and he has anger issues?",
  "if you are not ready to accept the breakup, you should not be in a relationship. it is your choice to break up with someone.",
  "i understand how that can feel like that.. but i do think that the best thing to do is take care of yourself.",
  "i have been in that position before, i have found that when i drink i tend to feel bored and bored.",

  "wow that does sound difficult. have there been any talks about ways to communicate with deaf people?",
  "so he is blocking you from being around people who believe in different things. that's a very bad thing.",
  "are you working?",
  "i am sorry that you are going through this. i know how hard it must be to feel when your peers are struggling.",
  "i see. i wonder if you could do a bit of online learning online too? maybe you could teach your son some online classes?",
  "is there something specific happening in nashville?",
  "do you have any friends who can help you prepare for the test?",
  "i am sure that you are not alone. you are certainly not alone in this.",
  "have you considered finding a local career center to help with your resume?",
  "that'll be a shame. i am sorry. i don ; t want to be rude, but i think it should be a general practice. do you have a family member you can talk to? )",
  "so she has been cheating with your friend?",
  "i do like salsa! i am a pretty good dancer.",

  "do you have a computer?",

  "i think i have had a breakup a few times too, but it was pretty easy to get over it.",
  "what would you say is the best way to approach this situation?",
  "it'll be great to take care of those unknowings though. you're doing your best to make sure they know what you've got.",
  "you have to be strong and strong. i think you'll find someone.",
  "i can imagine that it is hard to see your friend in public these days and you really don't need to be at home. i would suggest that they take a little break for a bit and then get back to their families. i know that is hard but it will get easier.",
  "i am so sorry for your loss. losing a loved one is a really hard thing, but i know it will get better.",
  "that sounds very difficult to deal with, i would be very concerned about that.",
  "i can understand how frustrating that is for you. have you tried talking to your friend about this?",
  "what are you thinking?",
  "i hope you feel a little better and hope to be able to heal from this.",

  "i am glad i could help! i hope you enjoy your afternoon!",

  "i can totally understand that. i am also in the same boat. have you tried talking to friends or family members?",
  "therapy is a great place to start, and you sound like a very mature and mature person.",
  "i believe you will find a way through this",
  "it is where you sign up for a form to work. the town would be able to offer you a different type of work. i would do that.",
  "i hear you. i think it is important that you take care of yourself when you feel stressed.",
  "that'd be a good idea, i think that would help me. i think you have a great plan and i think it will help you find a better job.",
  "i understand, it'll definitely take time to get used to the distance but i know that it'd be a great idea to walk home alone while you are looking for jobs!",
  "yes, they can be a lot, but you have to think of all the benefits of the therapy you are getting.",
  "it sounds like you have a good relationship with your husband, and i think you are trying your best to find the right one.",

  "i think it is a personal choice. you have a right to your own feelings.",
  "you too!",
  "how are you doing today?",

  "i am sorry to here that, you are really struggling with the same thing.",
  "haha well, i think you should try looking into other kind of job sites and see if they offer any job options for you.",
  "i can understand that. this is a very difficult situation to be in. i have found that it helps to talk to people who have been through the same thing.",
  "try to keep busy with the things you want to do.",
  "that sounds like a very valid decision.",
  "that is really frustrating. i'd definitely cut her out of my life first.",
  "yes i am a real human being and i feel the same",
  "that's tough. have you considered looking for a new job? i know many people who are in the same situation as you and are making great money.",

  "i think that you are making the right decision to say yes, but it is hard to be sure.",
  "it is difficult to get through these times.",
  "i'd be afraid to ask for help if you were worried. i would just reach out to the people who care about you.",
  "well, i know that i have gotten many jobs that i didn't need and i am still in it.",
  "i am sure you will be able to keep your head on straight.",
  "what kind of actions have you taken?",
  "i can understand that. i think that is a very tough situation. i would definitely consider a call to a support system such as a local unemployment line. it would be much easier to talk to someone about your situation.",
  "i've been trying to find something to do with my life. i have been working in my career field all day, and i'd love to help people get back to where they were in their normal days. i hope you can find something soon.",

  "you are welcome. it is a tough situation but you are trying your best to get through it.",
  "i see. are you getting the same results as you expected in your test?",
  "i think you've already made the right decision.",
  "i would suggest that he seek out professional help to cope. there are a lot of free therapy available online that could help.",
  "that is really horrible.",
  "you are welcome! have a wonderful day!",
  "you are welcome! have a wonderful summer!",
  "i am here to help you",
  "you should do what you think is best for you.",
  "i know it can be tough to make decisions that don't benefit us, but you can do it.",
  "i think it is a great idea to be a bit more active in your hobbies. i think that you will get through this!",
  "i understand that feeling, especially with covid coming on. do you have any friends or family that you can talk to?",
  "i have two cats! they're both rescues and they've been my babies. i feed them all the time, and they keep me company, too.",
  "if you feel you can help with your frustration, i would recommend breathing exercises, as they help me clear my head.",
  "i know that its a hard situation to be in, but it will get better for you eventually.",

  "i would recommend doing that, i have been able to do that.",
  "i've had to go through similar situations myself. it's a really hard situation to be in. do you think that maybe she was just jealous of your actions?",

  "you sound like a great person, and i wish you all the best.",
  "you are welcome.",
  "i think that'd be a great idea. it's not like they're going to be jealous if you approach someone you know well. it might be a little more personal but you can't be so quick to judge people's opinions or opinions.",
  "you should ask them about it, it is normal to be left out of plans.",
  "if you like someone, you will always be there for them, you just have to get over it.",
  "i understand. i'm in a similar situation, but i think that i'll just wait and see what happens.",
  "i think it really helps to take the time to reflect on your options and maybe see if there is something in particular that you really like.",
  "oh wow, drugs... i have a friend who lives in california that lives 5 hours from her fiance, and she lives five hours away.",
  "have you tried to find ways to distract yourself with more study work?",
  "i've been in a similar position before, and it'll definitely take some time to get used to the change, but i think that'll be easier for you to deal with now. it took me a while to find what i wanted, too.",
  "i am glad you reached out and have been able to talk with me!",
  "great! it is very calming and relaxes me. i hope you enjoy it. you can do this!",
  "i've been in your position before, i have been there and it's hard to get the necessary skills to succeed. i'd suggest talking to a tutor or a counsellor if you have one around.",
  "i am an american. i have tried a few languages and they are very difficult to learn.",
  "you too!",
  "have you tried to talk to your friends about how much you drink? maybe they would be able to give you advice on how to manage the amount.",

  "i understand, i have struggled with that myself as well, and its not easy to move on from that. it took me awhile to find a good career.",
  "you sound like a strong person and i can understand how you feel. i know how difficult it must be to be in that situation.",
  "if you are able to do so, you can also look online for jobs that you have applied for.",
  "i understand that. it is also hard to get a job when you are not able to find one.",
  "i've been through something similar. the first step is to find a way to stop the guilt from your friend.",
  "i would definitely recommend it. its a very good idea to get professional help from someone you trust.",
  "yes it did. i found it very helpful.",
  "why did you stop talking to your best friend?",
  "maybe she just needed some space and wasn't ready for a relationship. she could have been a better partner than you are.",
  "i think that you have the right idea! i am glad that you feel that you could be involved.",
  "i think that you are not alone in feeling this way. i think it is important to be positive.",
  "hello! how are you?",
  "you may feel overwhelmed and anxious and stress free. i know this is a difficult time for you but i believe you can overcome it.",
  "happy moments are the best, and that is why you can overcome this situation with time.",
  "i understand that trust is hard to get through. but, i do think you should have that 2 years to feel comfortable enough to make sure that you two people are not cheating. if you truly trust them, you should not feel that they are cheating. i am happy for you that you are able to make a decision about how to deal with these issues.",
  "you are most welcome, i hope you find a better job soon.",
  "that is the goal. the goal is to get the small tasks done.",
  "i am doing well, thank you for asking. what is going on?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. it sounds like you feel isolated and your academic pressure is making you anxious. is that correct?",
  "i know how you are feeling, i also have a child and i feel that i have never been able to go out as much as i would like to.",
  "it took me a while to realize that i wasn'' t supposed to trust others, but i did start to trust myself.",
  "you are self aware. it sounds you are not.",
  "i will take my time.",
  "i've been in that position before, and it really helped me learn a lot about my career.",
  "i've had trouble with that too.",
  "oh i see, so you are in a very rough spot at the moment?",
  "you too!",
  "i can understand your anxiety about that. it is not easy to get into a career when you are so down on yourself.",
  "i think that you should try to have a more open conversation about your feelings and maybe that will help them understand why you are having this issue.",
  "what has been going on?",
  "wow that is a lot. i can understand how stressful that must be.",
  "i'm sorry to hear you feel that way. it sounds like you are suffering from depression. is that right?",
  "i've been in a similar situation before, actually. it was very difficult. but i got through it, and it helped me to get through it.",
  "oh okay, well, i would suggest looking into online groups that could help you out.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, is the new year getting better for you?",
  "that'll be great to hear! it seems like you're trying to keep yourself busy. i know you'll get through this!",
  "i know it's tough, but the first step is to build on your best!",
  "bye",
  "what kind of job do you want?",
  "do you have any hobbies or hobbyinterests?",
  "i love football, just don'tbe overwhelmed by the challenges..",
  "i hear you! it'll be nice to be able to work remotely now though. i know it'd be a lot harder with a lot of work, but it'sn't impossible to make ends meet!",
  "yes, i have. i spend a lot of time online.",
  "have you tried to talk to your friends about this?",
  "ah ok, well i hope you are doing okay now.",
  "why are you sad?",
  "have you ever talked to anyone about it?",
  "so you were having a good time with her?",
  "it sounds like you are feeling as though your relationship has failed, is that correct?",
  "i hope i was able to be of some help to you today! i hope you feel a bit better.",
  "i am good, how can i help you? what would you like to talk about?",
  "oh no. why is that?",
  "i understand.. i was never really interested in playing board games.. however, i started playing a lot more with my kids.. it is very relaxing",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. can you tell me more about what's been going on?",
  "that sounds like a great plan, it will help him come around eventually.",
  "that is understandable. i know that many people are afraid to talk about their depression because they fear that they will be let down.",
  "it sounds like you have a lot of people in your life who are not able to take care of themselves, and that is sad.",
  "how are you feeling?",
  "i am glad i could help!",
  "exactly! and it'll take time. people should be more open to change.",
  "i am so sorry. i am glad i could help you. i hope you can get some sunshine soon.",
  "i have found that telling myself how i am doing is a very good way to help me feel better.",
  "you're welcome.",
  "you'd probably feel like you've already put yourself at risk, but there is no harm in trying. the only thing that would be hurting you right now is the fact that you'll be in a better place without doug.",
  "that makes sense. have you tried talking to a supervisor? they may be able to help you out.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. what happened?",
  "hi how are you?",
  "that'd be a good idea. you could even give him a call and let him know you are upset and want to talk to him again.",
  "maybe you can try a video chat, or try to schedule a meeting with your coworke; there is a group of people you can chat with that may be able to help you out.",
  "that'll be a very big family. i would imagine you're really proud of them.",
  "that sounds like a great plan!",
  "you are welcome. i hope that you feel better soon.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "that is very hard.",
  "i'm so sorry. do you have any friends or family that you can talk to about it?",
  "hi there, how are you?",
  "thank you!",
  "that sounds like a lot of stuff to be into. is there a way you could spend time away from your family during this time?",
  "i can see how that would be hard for you. i would feel the same way.",
  "so you were laid off due to a pandemic?",
  "i've been there too. i'd be too.",
  "i would also suggest talking to a counselor or therapist. there are a lot of free resources available for mental health care.",
  "it'll take some time, but just try to focus on what's going on right now.",
  "i'd be happy to help if you could - it'd really help me to hear from you!",
  "you too!",
  "i have two children as well! it can be a challenging time!",
  "i can understand how you feel, it has been a really tough year for everyone.",
  "yes, i have noticed when i am feeling stressed i tend to fall into a panic attack.",
  "it's not about getting over someone. it'll make you feel better.",
  "so, you feel you have been hit by a wave of new challenges?",
  "you can always ask your professor for the details and see if he can provide them.",
  "that is really difficult, i am sorry to here that you are feeling that way. have you tried talking to anyone about this?",
  "i can imagine that you felt that way.",
  "i understand that feeling, it took me awhile to get over my loss too.",
  "yes, you said you are unhappy with your self motivation. i don ; t think you should be taking that gamble.",
  "yes, it was hard to publish. i had to write in english. i was afraid to write any other language in the us.",
  "i'm doing well thanks, tell me about yourself?",
  "it sounds like you are trying to do a lot of work but are not being able to pay bills. it sounds as though this is a very difficult situation to be in.",
  "i understand how you feel. it is so hard to see someone who has been through something so difficult.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. how long ago did the break up take?",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "have you considered looking into getting a nanny or counselling? i hear that helps a lot.",
  "hi, how are you today?",
  "i would definitely talk to the upper manager about it. you are a great employee.",
  "i've also had friends that were similarly toxic, and it'd be hard for them to have someone they were close to who was as well. i think it might be best to find a new friend that you can trust more.",
  "i think that's the right way to look at it.",
  "that is understandable. i can understand how anxiety can make it difficult to talk with people.",
  "i know it can be a very difficult situation to go through especially when you are in a relationship that is so uncertain but i know you can make it through it",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i know that sometimes it's best to look at the positive in someone else's life, whether it be a family member, a friend, a loved one, or even a stranger.",
  "what kind of work do you do?",
  "i know it can be very hard to feel alone right now. i know there are plenty of online groups for that. i personally found that a lot of people were having a lot more fun at the park.",
  "hello",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "it might be best to let them talk about it with you",
  "that'll definitely help you feel more relaxed!",
  "i am sorry to here that you were laid off, it sounds like you have a lot of resources available.",
  "yes, you have to be well rested to do well on tests.",
  "i think it would be good to talk about your feelings. maybe you can try and discuss your feelings with your friends and family.",
  "hi, how are you feeling today?",
  "but i know you will get through this and i am sure you will be able to find someone that is willing and able to be the same for you.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "you should talk to your partner, it is their fault",
  "i can understand where you are coming from. my daughter is a very toxic person and i know how stressful that is for her.",
  "pampering is really good! i am sure you will feel great in a bit : ) i hope you have a wonderful day!",
  "i hope so too.",
  "i'd say that it'd be a good start!",
  "i am hoping you will find something soon!",
  "ah, well i think the best thing you can do is take the time to write out a list of tasks that you'd like to do. perhaps you could make a list for the companies that would be interested in hiring you for those tasks.",
  "have you tried to tell them that you have been trying to get some sort of payment?",
  "you've got this. you'll be surprised how nice you can be when you'get to know your family. i've been in a situation like this before.",
  "that's great! hope you have a great rest of the holiday season!",
  "i would definitely look at things like this as a learning opportunity. if you feel you can help your family, then i think you should definitely look into that and make sure that you have every option available.",
  "yes that might be a good place to start. it might be helpful to ask him if he has any other problems or problems that you would like to talk about. i know that sometimes people are just feeling that they need someone to vent to, and that is normal.",
  "i'd suggest setting up some zoom calls with people you trust. maybe even go to a park or a cafe.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. it is hard to go into the turmoil when we are in a relationship.",
  "have you considered talking to them about how you feel?",
  "if you don't feel comfortable mending it, i don'think you should try to force it on him.",
  "i've been through similar feelings. i had a lot of depression after i had my first child, and it took years to get over it.",
  "is this a part of your studies or is this one of your previous studies?",
  "i think that is a good start!",
  "have you considered looking for an online job? i have found that online work can be more helpful than in person.",
  "that'll definitely make things difficult, especially when you have a child who seems to be the bigger one.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what has been going on?",
  "you are most welcome! i wish you all the best, and i wish your friends and family the best of luck!",
  "i agree. it'll help you feel better.",
  "you don'feel alone, but that'd be a great way to feel that you'd feel good in another way. it'd also help you feel more empathetic to yourself.",
  "it can be hard, but i think if you reach out to someone you trust and they will understand and be more open to talking to you again",
  "okay, good luck",
  "so it's not something you can do during the day?",
  "i found a job on craigslist. i also did some freelance work online.",
  "i would bring up that you saw his photos of christmas party and how he put people at danger and see if he could help.",
  "you are welcome! i hope you enjoy your day!",
  "that's really bad, i've had that happen to me before.",
  "i understand. i had a boss that did not produce enough money for his employees. it was really frustrating.",
  "that's a lot of work! i understand how you feel!",
  "it is always nice to talk with people who are facing the same issues as you.",
  "no problem. i hope you have a great day!",
  "i think that you should feel confident that that you will be the right person for her.",
  "that'll be a good start.",
  "so, you are saying that your wife is interested in having sex with your best friend?",
  "well, i think that you should seek professional help if you are feeling as though you are unable to cope with the situation.",
  "what is your husband's problem?",
  "i know it sounds like i am a little short but i know that you can get a new one.",
  "no problem, i hope you can figure out a solution.",
  "i understand how you feel. there are so many issues that are being discussed and the news is just really not a place for it.",
  "hi, how are you doing today?",
  "oh nice! that sounds like a great way to make money. have you thought about reaching out to your local mturk group or any other social media sites?",
  "it sounds like you're a little hesitant about getting a private care, given that it would be difficult for you to find one.",
  "you said you've worked in the business field for several yyears. is that true?",
  "if you are feeling as though you are protecting your friend from the virus then i would suggest talking to her about this.",
  "i think that if you take the time to do things that make you happy, you can always make them fun again.",
  "is there a specific problem that you are having?",
  "do you have any friends that could help you out?",
  "it was like a pandemic",
  "it could make you feel any different if you are not able to talk about it",
  "you can also try to make some new memories and maybe spend time with her in a way that will cheer her back up.",
  "i think i would be more upset if i was you.",
  "i'm doing well. thank you for asking. how can i help you? what's on your mind?",
  "what do you think your work is about?",
  "i can see how it would be stressful if you were not able to find work, especially since the pandas are so closed. i would suggest reaching out to the government, or the police, for any help you might need.",
  "it sounds like you are having a lot of stress. is there anything that might be causing this?",
  "you're welcome, i hope you have a wonderful day!",
  "it sounds to me that your boss is being unfair to you. i would not want to work with someone who is unfair to me either.",
  "i would say that it is good to talk to people who understand your situation and are concerned that you may be able to help.",
  "i understand that. i have had to deal with it before and it is hard to get through.",
  "riya is a beautiful name.",
  "oh i've been there too, i had a friend pass away a few years ago and it was really hard. i understand your feelings, i lost a loved one recently and it took me a while to deal with it.",
  "ok... so you don't want to share what you have..",
  "have you tried reaching out to friends or coworkers that you may be able to talk to about this?",
  "it sounds like you are a mature, strong person.",
  "i know how you feel, it is hard to find someone who loves you the most.",
  "that is a long time. i'm sorry to hear that.",
  "i would suggest to watch those you are close to and keep your distance. i know it may be hard for you but i believe you can do it.",
  "i hear you, i've been in that position a few times. it's tough when you have to put your life ahead of everything.",
  "i think that you should definitely be careful about that. it's not easy to be alone in this situation.",
  "bye",
  "you too!",
  "sometimes it helps to build up a habit, like taking a small break from the routine, and then reorganizing it.",
  "i'm glad i could be some help. good night!",
  "maybe it'll help you to get to know upper management better. it sounds like you're dealing with an upper management who doesn'; t take feedback very well.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have you tried to talk to your doctor about it?",
  "it sounds like you have some issues right now. is there anything else you can think of?",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "i started feeling sadness at age 40",
  "i am doing well, thank you for asking. what happened?",

  "i am sure you will be fine, i have been there before and it is very tough.",
  "so it sounds like you are working part time and looking for new jobs?",
  "you can always do it! it's never a sure thing, but it'll help you find someone else.",
  "i've had a lot more problems with my supervisor than i thought before. it'll be nice to get some rest.",
  "you're very welcome! i wish you all the best!",

  "i hope you have a good day!",
  "i can understand how you feel as i've been in a similar situation before. it can be a stressful situation to not be able to manage both your studies and your career. do you think that the amount of time you'd be putting into it would be worth it?",
