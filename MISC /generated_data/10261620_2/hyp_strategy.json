  "you're welcome. i think you'll be able to.",
  "it sounds like you are not a very good parent. have your children tried to talk to you about how to help them financially?",
  "how long does it take to be sad?",
  "do you think you could join a new activity? perhaps you could take a walk outside, or go for a hike or something.",
  "it is very true that there are problems with our teeth and they are getting worse.",
  "i think that you should really be prepared for him, because if you don'feel he is not being listened to, you are going to be so sad and angry.",
  "you're welcome.",
  "well, if you like to play sports, you might want to try to find something you can do while you go.",
  "and i think that you are doing your best!",
  "it sounds like you are not feeling good for your ex. i am sorry.",
  "i am so happy to hear that and i wish you the best.",
  "oh i'm so stressed out right now... i don't know what to do..",
  "i don't think that's a problem. i've been a professional therapist for many years. i think you'll be fine.",
  "you're welcome! i hope you feel better.",
  "i think that'd be a really good reason to move on.",
  "it sounds like you're really putting yourself first and trying to do what's right for you. i'd suggest setting aside time to pay them off, even though it's not something you'd be comfortable doing.",
  "i am also a mature school student and struggled with my school. do you think you can seek professional help?",
  "i think it would be!",
  "it sounds like you are ready for a break up with him and i am sure that you will be able to.",
  "you're welcome! i am glad to help.",
  "what happened?",
  "just think about the good times. i am sure he will come around.",
  "bye",
  "just try and talk to them about it. tell them that you love them and want to be with them.",
  "i think that's a valid argument. did you say that you think that he was manipulation, or that you were just concerned that he might take that as a challenge?",
  "that's good...",
  "volunteering is a good way to keep your social life going.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. have you tried talking to her about how you are feeling?",
  "that sounds like a great plan!",
  "i understand. have you tried contacting unemployment?",
  "you too!",
  "ok. is it that that you would feel that he may not be willing to give you more time?",
  "that is very understandable. but the fact that you can share your feelings shows you care and that you are caring for your friends. you are a great friend and they deserve you.",
  "he doesn t want to sleep in your bed or sleep with you, he wants you to sleep without him",
  "i think that would be a great idea!",
  "i think you should try to find a new hobby that you enjoy. i'm sure you'll feel better in a while.",
  "that's terrible. i can definitely relate to your feelings. i have been in a similar situation and it was hard.",
  "i think if you are talking to your husband about how he feels, you may find that he is probably right.",
  "did you speak to your supervisor?",
  "i think you need to be more aware of how you are feeling and how you can't control it.",
  "well, that'll give you plenty of energy. it'll be great to get a good rest, and you'll feel a little better.",
  "deep breaths can help when you are stressed out, and they are great for closing your eyes. you can also start by practicing breathing, and then continue to do so.",
  "oh that sounds terrible. how long have you had it?",
  "i can imagine how disgusted you must feel. i would be too. have a talk with her about how you feel and see what she has to say.",
  "you need to go to a professional, because they are there for you, and you need help with everything else",
  "i see, so you feel you feel that you cannot live with your mind and not your feelings?",
  "you are a great person. i hope that you can find something that helps.",
  "i understand that, but it is better than not knowing how to do things.",
  "it sounds like you are upset with him because he is ignoring you",
  "i think that you have accomplished something! it is a great idea!",
  "have a great day!",
  "what do you think your business will recover from?",
  "i've been in your shoes. i think you will be okay. i believe you will find someone.",
  "you have to see that you have done everything you can do to help him out. i think you should recognize that.",
  "i know it's a tough situation, but i think that there are a lot of things that you can do.",
  "i have had my fair share of issues with academic, but i think we all are facing the exact same situation. we all have to learn the same thing and do everything to make it through.",
  "that's really unfair. i think you should be more careful.",
  "i have been in a similar situation before. it took a while to find a new job, but i am confident that i will get it back eventually.",
  "no, i don't think that you have any idea of what is going on. i think you'll be okay.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. it sounds like you are really worried about your safety.",
  "have you tried looking online for a job?",
  "i think that you should have a plan for this, and i think you'll have a great opportunity to make it through.",

  "are you able to talk to him and get help?",
  "and what do you think the chances are of you being able to find a new job?",
  "of course! i'm happy to listen!",
  "i would suggest finding someone who will be willing to listen to your feelings and help you find the right person",
  "i know it is difficult, but i think you are able to find some new friends that you like and are willing to share your feelings with.",
  "wow, that is a lot. i would be concerned too, but at least you have a plan.",
  "i think that's a good start..",
  "of course. i am glad you are starting to feel better about it.",
  "i think you might need to try to find someone who has a better understanding of your issues.",
  "i think that is a great idea. cooking a good food is so important and also getting yourself a good home for christmas.",
  "thanks.",
  "i am sorry. i have been there before. it is not an easy thing to do.",
  "bye",
  "what do you mean?",
  "i think that is a great idea! it will really help you to reach out for help and encourage you.",
  "you seem to know a lot of things about yourself and how you are feeling. i'm so proud of you for wanting children.",

  "i am so happy to hear that. i wish you all the best and hope you get to talk with your partner.",
  "i think you should try to focus on yourself.",
  "i think it is great that you are willing to be open to learning new things and listening to someone who doesn'tt want to change their way of life.",
  "i think you should do it. you have a lot going on and you're going to feel much better after that.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. have you been able to talk to your family about this?",
  "yeah, that sounds like a plan.",
  "you are welcome.",
  "i know that's very hard to do. i think that you are doing the right thing though. you don't need to travel for the rest, you can travel with your kids and family.",
  "i think you are absolutely right, i've been in a situation like this myself. i'd like to suggest you seek professional help if you can.",
  "merry christmas!",
  "i understand. it's not easy to get hold of people you don't know. i think it might be worth asking for a hold on your own though. maybe you could ask your boss if you can talk to him about the situation?",
  "have you tried looking online and applying for jobs?",
  "that is a great idea. i think it would be a great time to try and get a raise.",
  "i think it is important to know that you are an american and you will be happy with that!",
  "i am glad i could help.",
  "i think it'd be a great idea to talk to your friends and see how it is affecting your mental health.",
  "exactly. i've been in a lot of situations where i'd be able to have more than one account with my credit cards, and i'll be able too.",
  "i understand, i would too. it's not a very good thing to be having someone who is not your friend.",
  "it will be okay, your girlfriend will understand",
  "you are very welcome! best of luck to you too!",
  "have you talked to her about this?",
  "i'm glad to hear it.",

  "that sounds like a really terrible situation.",
  "have you tried meditation? it is a great way to release some extra sleep.",
  "im so sorry to hear that. have you tried contacting a local counsellor?",
  "i have had some hard time expressing myself myself and it has been a difficult time for me. but, i have learned that i have to let go of the emotions and the fact that i am a woman and i can be rejected.",
  "i would suggest ubering if you're not able to, as it's far more risky.",
  "i can relate, i had a friend who was gone for almost a year as well. it was a very scary time for me, but i'm glad that we were able to get some help.",
  "i can understand why that would be difficult. it sounds like you are a very positive person. are you able to recognize that you are not doing everything right?",
  "that is great! i think it is very helpful to be open with people and seek help.",
  "i can understand that, i have been in a similar situation when i was struggling with sleep issues.",
  "i think you are on the right track. i think we can all be proud of you.",

  "so you are saying that you are still having problems with your family?",
  "i understand that, what is the situation?",
  "that's a good idea! it sounds like you've had a great shot at getting a b.",
  "you could always try to look into getting a large gift for christmas. maybe a small gift for yourself and a small party for your family.",
  "i can relate to that, i am not in the south but live in canada. i try to focus on my work and do research papers.",
  "i think you are going to do great!",
  "it sounds like she has some issues.",
  "you are welcome! i hope you feel better.",
  "glad i could help.",
  "i think it is best to let them get a sense of how you feel and their expectations, and that you are open to them.",
  "same to you! have a wonderful day!",
  "i am so sorry, meditation is not for everyone. i can relate to that, it does not help me either.",
  "you too!",
  "you are welcome, i am glad i could help.",
  "you too!",
  "that'll be a big deal. i am glad that you're still friends. i think you will be able to find support during this difficult time.",
  "so you can't pay any extra money but it still feels like you don't make enough money",
  "it's ok, i understand.. i have been in that position.. it'll get easier.. but i can tell you're not alone.. you've got this",
  "i know that you are a great person. i hope you can find some solutions and be a good person",
  "that sounds like a really difficult situation. i'd suggest talking to them and seeing if they can help. it's good to have someone to talk to!",
  "i think that's understandable. but it'll pass. i'm sure you will find someone!",
  "i think you are doing the right thing. you can only control yourself.",
  "i think that your parents are not going to be able too go by your standards as you are only 17",
  "i understand. i know it can be hard to let go of people who don't want to join a group. do you feel that you are not being able to join?",
  "if she has been covering people for the past year, how can you tell she is lying?",
  "no problem! good luck!",
  "that sounds like a really selfish thing to do.",
  "it is! i've been there before. i have a 99 percent certain it will be again.",
  "you're welcome. i'm glad i was able to help. i hope you have a great trip to europe and enjoy it!",
  "i am sorry. i am not a professional, but i do understand. i think it's very hard to learn to say virtually. i also have a bad history and practice rehearse.",
  "it'll be nice to have someone to talk to, but at the same time, i think you should be the first person to reach out to.",
  "i suggest a book or two each day, it is a great distraction.",
  "try playing games you enjoy that will help",
  "you too!",
  "i would start by looking for job online. you can search online and see what type of jobs you want to try.",
  "i know it'll be difficult, but it sounds like you have a plan. i know you will get through this!",
  "that's a good idea! i think you should leave now, then just take the honeymoon, then come back home.",
  "that's a great idea! maybe you can find a way to confide in her and explain to your friends that you have a problem and you don't really want to be with her. if she does not want to talk to you, she will never understand that you are being honest with her and it's not her problem.",
  "have you tried to talk to her about how you feel?",
  "it sounds like you have been trying to find a solution to your problem and the people around you have just been telling you to stay calm and stop the business that is going on.",
  "yes, i do not have any suggestions but i do know that there are many charities that might offer counselling services.",
  "i can imagine how difficult this would be for you. do you think this is due to the insufficiency of the teacher?",
  "you're welcome. i hope you have a great day and i wish you all the best!",
  "it was very hard financially. but i know that you can overcome this!",
  "it's true. we all have to worry about the unknown, but it'd be nice to have a little more control over it.",
  "i think you need to be firm with her. i don't know if it is possible for you to talk to her now, but it seems like you are being selfish and not considering the friendship.",
  "you are welcome, i wish you all the best and hope that you get to talk to her.",
  "i think you are doing the best you can. it's nice that you've reached out.",
  "that's terrible. i'm so sorry you have to go through this.",
  "yes, i think you should do that. that way you can take care and do care of yourself and your kids. and they are your children.",
  "you are very welcome. i am glad i could help.",
  "i am so sorry, it sounds like you have a lot of problems, what is your job?",
  "i have been in a similar situation. i know how difficult it can be.",
  "you can also try taking a vacation somewhere that you enjoy, and see if it helps.",
  "just do your best and dont let them get to you, just let them know you need to do your study and study and then give them the phone.",
  "i am sure you will be successful.",
  "you've got this!",
  "it sounds like you have a great support system and are doing a great job staying positive. i know you can feel a little down, but i think that you will find someone to talk to and have a really good time.",

  "you're welcome. i wish you well.",
  "have you thought about doing some exercise or reading a book?",
  "yes it does. it's been nice to be able to meet people online.",
  "i think that is a good idea!",
  "well, it is not like it is gonna rain or snow, but it is still going to happen. the only thing we can do is try to make sure it stays safe.",
  "you're welcome! i wish you all the best.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i am so sorry.",
  "yeah, cheesake is a great choice.",
  "i'm glad i could help!",
  "is there anything that she is doing that is bothering you?",
  "have a great day!",

  "i understand how you feel, it is a hard situation for everyone.",
  "yes try to find a new activity you enjoy and try to focus on that",
  "so you are saying that you feel that he does have a problem with you and that you are working towards it.",
  "is there anything you want to talk about that would help you feel better?",
  "i understand that, but it might be worth trying to find a new hobby to distract yourself with.",
  "yes, i can feel how stressed you are.",
  "it sounds like you are concerned about the relationship with your girlfriend and you are worried about taking action to take care of her happiness.",
  "i understand. it is understandable. i have been in the same position as you. i had to quit after leaving, but i just kept on trying and trying. i realized that i needed to be more self aware and i could not give up, but it did not feel as though i was being ignored or ignored as much as i thought.",
  "i do like books, especially when i read with a friend.",
  "have you tried to talk to her about the issue?",
  "you'r welcome!",
  "no i am not. i have a daughter and two boys",
  "you too! have a great new year as well!",
  "i can understand your feelings..",
  "you are welcome. have a great night.",
  "you too!! i'm so glad you are feeling better.",
  "thank you!",
  "if you don't want to tell them, then you've got your choice and you'd be right to do that.",
  "what did you say?",
  "i think you are correct. college is a stressful time for everyone. i think that you should try to remember that you have a responsibility and that you cannot be blamed for things that you don't need to be.",
  "i know this is hard, but i think that you should try to find a new hobby or get a new job.",
  "i see.. i have a lot going on with girls.. and i think it's normal to want to wear make up.",
  "that's good to hear. have you looked into any other job opportunities that might have helped you in the past?",
  "that's really old.. but you deserve someone who can be patient and caring",
  "yes, i agree.. i would say that if you pay attention to what you buy, you will find something you like : )",
  "have you talked to anyone about this?",
  "oh wow that's terrible. i'm so sorry. i have a friend who lost her parents recently and her children had suicide thoughts too. i know that it's so hard to deal with, but i can empathize with it.",
  "i am very sorry, it sounds like you are feeling a little overwhelmed.",
  "i'm glad. i've been having trouble with my anxiety, but it's been getting easier.",
  "oh i am so sorry. what happened?",
  "i have been doing it for 11 years now",
  "i understand that completely. i think it's very difficult when you don't have a lot of options. but i think you can do it!",
  "it's good that you are making the right decision, and you don'tthink that you should leave them. you are a very positive person.",
  "maybe try to talk to her and tell her that you are not happy with her being obsessed with the politics of the pandetrix. maybe she will feel more comfortable with you staying home with her.",
  "do you think that perhaps you are depressed because you don't have a job or a job that you'd like to work?",
  "that's great! i'm glad to hear that. i think you'll do great.",
  "that'sounds like a great idea! i would recommend that you look into it. i know it's hard right now but there are lots of people in need right now and it'll be okay to start a new life.",
  "i am so sorry. do you have any other pets?",
  "it seems like you have a lot of feelings for her. have you tried to talk her out of it?",
  "just remember, you need to do what is best for you.",
  "i think that's completely normal! we all struggle with our own problems at some point.",
  "it'll probably be a good idea to do some research on how to get around.",
  "search online and find a job that you like",
  "is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "you are welcome.",
  "i think you will do great. i wish you the best of luck and i wish for you the very best of hope for your future.",

  "oh my goodness! is there any way you can talk about it?",
  "that sounds like a great idea!",
  "yes, i can understand how that feels. i have been in a similar situation myself and it really is hard.",
  "that sounds like a great idea. do you have any other thoughts or concerns that you would like to talk about?",

  "sure!! goodbye",
  "it is a local book club. it is great for finding people who are interested in your interests.",
  "it sounds like you are feeling a little bit disrespected. is that correct?",
  "i would be worried too. it might not be the best time to talk to someone about it.",
  "i think that'd be a great idea. we've all been there, but it'll be good to have someone who can listen and listen.",
  "you are very welcome!!",
  "it sounds like you are trying a lot of things to work through this.",
  "no problem, happy holidays.",
  "that is understandable. it sounds like you are feeling a little overwhelmed. you should definitely talk to a professional. it's not easy to get a job that is so uncertain. i know that you are going to make it through this!",
  "i hope that you have been able to find peace with your situation.",
  "i would suggest looking for lists online. there are a few different types.",
  "how long have you been together?",
  "i know that it'll be a good opportunity to talk to her and try to understand why you want to break up with your friend.",
  "you are welcome dear, take care.",
  "i have been to medium before and enjoyed it, i also have been on that forum many times",
  "that's very sweet. i know that you are going through tough times and i can see how you are feeling. but do you think that your daughter is being selfish?",
  "i love it too!",
  "do you think you can talk to your teacher about how you feel? you seem to be having a really hard time finding a way to do this without worrying about schooling.",
  "oh good!!!",
  "thats good! do you think that wearing a masks will help?",
  "i am very happy to hear that. happy holidays to you too.",
  "that's completely understandable, it's hard to let go of feelings when someone is feeling down.",
  "he will",
  "i can imagine that would be very frustrating. do you have a friend or family member who might be able to help you out?",
  "you too! have a good night.",
  "i think it would be wise to speak to them. do you think that they might be able to give you some sort of support?",
  "i'm glad that you have some support. i think that you will be able to find a great time to chat with others as well!",
  "yes, and the other person needs to realize that she's not your friend. she'll be your friend forever.",
  "yes, but please take your time",
  "do you think it would be a good idea to seek out new advice?",
  "i can understand that. when i was younger, i felt that way too. i had no idea that we were in the exact neighborhood.",
  "that's great! is there anything else you'd like to talk about?",
  "i understand, it is very difficult. do you think it is worth trying to talk to her about it?",

  "so you are saying they are trying your best but they are not being honest?",
  "i am sorry, what do u need help with?",
  "what do you mean?",

  "do you think you could make some new friends to keep you company?",
  "i am happy to hear you are so open to learning new things!",

  "i think it is hard but i think you are on the right track. i think that you will find that you are doing the right thing.",
  "i see. i have a daughter. i think that it might be a good idea to make her name frank, then you could set clear boundaries.",
  "i think you should try to talk to someone with a clear head.",
  "i can feel your anxiety, but keep trying.",
  "i don'tknow, but i don ; t think you should worry. you can always cut your meal intake down to maybe 2 or 3 cups a day and see if that helps.",
  "you too!",

  "yes, you can play games with people on skyp. i'm sure you'd be great!",

  "i think you are going through a lot. i have been in a similar situation. i just can't imagine how you are feeling.",
  "i can understand that. i think that'd be a difficult thing to do. but i think it'd make sense to have more time to have a good relationship with your child.",
  "you've already reached out! you are welcome!",
  "i am glad to hear that. i hope you are able to talk to your manager and feel more positive and at ease.",
  "have you thought about talking to your boss and asking him to give you more time?",

  "i think it's worth a shot. it'll give you something to look forward to and if they like you, they'll do it too.",
  "dogs are so sweet. dogs are great companion, and they are so loving. you have a wonderful dog!",
  "i think you should be more careful with that. i think it'd just be a matter of time before you start acting toxic again",
  "you too!",
  "i think that if you don'try to talk to him, he will see that you are being a supportive friend. i think you should try to see if he is doing his best to help you.",
  "i can understand how you feel. i've had a hard time letting go of my ex's mistakes. i had a difficult time accepting that my fault was my own and that i was the ones who should've taken the blame.",

  "i have been in a similar situation with a coworker and it is extremely stressful. it took me awhile to figure out why the problem was going on.",
  "ok. i think you need to go and talk to your friend and let her know how you feel.",
  "nice! that sounds like a great plan.",
