[contxt]	0 0 13 Yes I've been dealing with my son's addiction and recovery and relapses for the last three years.  EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I can relate to being close to someone who is addicted. It can feel very sad and lonely at times. I would want to change the person in my life but just has to learn to let go instead. It is a process that takes years to learn.  EOS 0 0 15 I am realizing that more every day. If it wasn't my son and just a good friend I would probably end the relationship but a mother can't do that to her own children, you know what I mean?  EOS 0 0 16 And you are so right. I can't change or control him, I can only change and control myself and my responses to him. That is so difficult to do.  EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, I understand how it can feel like our children are always our babies and we want to fix everything for them. Sometimes it feels like we can change them or re raise them if we just do more for them.  EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Have you had the chance to speak to a close friend or pastor about this situation?  EOS 0 0 19 Not really. Most of my friends haven't dealt with that so they don't really understand what I am going through, or even what my son is going through.

[contxt]	0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Feeling down after an experience like that is certainly understandable, and I suspect that might be the main cause of your depression.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Regarding losing your job, I wouldn't worry too much. New businesses are opening each day as the pandemic slowly goes away. You will have plenty of job opportunities. Similarly, you will also regain your confidence and social status as you interact with society more.  EOS 0 0 7 Yes, but its a vicious circle.

It's really taking a toll on all of us emotionally to be distant.

[hypothesis_response]	[Providing Suggestions] i think that you should look into meditation and getting some sort of exercise.
[comet query]	Yes, stress is terrible for chronic illness. I had goals to get back in check with myself, I've been worried about everyone else for so long and not really about me. The pandemic haulted a lot of that. I used to take rides and go out and enjoy nature or something simple by myself to rejuvinate but it's harder now being worried to be around people. I also have an 8 and 1 year old. While they are my world, it's taxing having littles depend on you 24/7 without a breather :)

EOS 1 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah, I mean it's never easy going through a breakup, but people change as they get older and mature, and they aren't necessarily going to still be compatible the whole time.

EOS 4 0 6 I did and they respond by saying that they are just joking and that I'm handsome. But it's starting to get on my nerves because it's all they make fun about every time they see me!  EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure you are very handsome! They could just be jealous. 
[reference_response]	[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure you are very handsome! They could just be jealous.
[hypothesis_response]	[Affirmation and Reassurance] i can understand that, but i think it'd be better to sit down and talk to them and say why they're being bullied.

[contxt]	0 0 11 Sorry to hear that.  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Time heals all wounds. While that doesn't sound helpful now it is true. I also found focusing on the good experiences I had with my father (or in this case your best friend) helps. Remembering the times where you both were happy.  EOS 0 0 13 I will try to do that. How can I handle this sleepless nights?  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That's a tough one. I personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons. Some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed. I have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines. The biggest thing is to not use your bedroom for anything but sleeping; so don't read a book or play on your phone in bed, you have to train your body that when you go to bed it is time to sleep.  EOS 0 0 15 Sounds like stuff I can try out.  EOS 0 0 16 I have a strong attachment to my phone. Will be a tough one to try leaving it off while I try to get some sleep.  EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] Having a bedtime routine is also another tip. Try to do the same thing every night before bed. Have a consistent bedtime, wake up around the same time everyday, even on days that you don't have to go to work.  EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, phone's are tough to give up but soooo many studies show how bad they are for your sleep. 
[reference_response]	[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, phone's are tough to give up but soooo many studies show how bad they are for your sleep.
[hypothesis_response]	[Providing Suggestions] i think you should try a few things to keep yourself busy, or to talk to your friend and talk to them about how you are feeling. sometimes talking to your best friends can help to clear your mind.

EOS 5 1 13 [Others] If you don't mind me asking  EOS 5 0 14 i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn't strong enough.  EOS 5 1 15 [Question] Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can. Has she been in contact with you?  EOS 5 0 16 no. she hasn't done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her  EOS 5 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Seems like a good idea.

[contxt]	3 0 4 I know i'll be safe.. but I have depression and it affects me the most at night, every night. I feel like i can't escape it.  EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. I have struggled to deal with depression most of my life, so I know it can be debilitating, but I have found ways to help myself.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Is there a specific problem making you depressed, or life in general?  EOS 3 0 7 I'd love to hear them. There is one problem in general i'm having that i seem to have always had because of the Depression. I have an extremely difficult time falling asleep.. and whenever I do manage to fall asleep.. i wake up always feeling like crap. I never feel rested no matter how long i sleep.  EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I have had trouble sleeping in the past and sometimes I still do, usually if it is when I'm nervous about the future.  EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] The number one way I have had to help my depression is to pray and read scripture. I don't know if you are a Christian, but that has helped me a lot. The second way is to have a good friend who will listen, not someone who will TELL me what to do or judge me, but someone who can empathize with me. A good listener is worth her weight in gold.  EOS 3 0 10 I've learned that mines not really an emotional thing. I feel like my sleeping issue causes my depression. Because no matter what- i always feel exhausted. Nothing has helped it besides medication. It just sucks always feeling fatigued and energyless. I actually did take up religion here this year to help with the coping that comes with this. It was very helpful for a while there  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If I didn't get good rest, then I would definitely feel tired the next day and over time, it would wear me out. I believe medication will help with the symptoms, but it is important to get the root of the problem, why exactly you find it difficult to sleep.

EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] before you take any action, i'd ask myself what are your options?  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you know that his actions have very little to do with you and more to do with him, right?  EOS 3 0 10 Well, I could move out but I can't afford to rent a flat on my own. I'd have to move in with my parents, realistically.  EOS 3 0 11 I keep telling myself that but I feel really betrayed. I keep wondering what she is like and whether she is prettier and more successful than me.  EOS 3 1 12 [Question] are your parents supportive of that idea?  EOS 3 0 13 I have not really talked to them about it. I feel a bit ashamed having to admit to them that my relationship has not worked out.  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it's not about her or you. it's about him. 
[reference_response]	[Affirmation and Reassurance] it's not about her or you. it's about him.
[hypothesis_response]	[Providing Suggestions] i think you are doing a great job, but i would suggest that you have some time to think about it before you decide to move back in with your parents. i think it would be helpful to take deep breaths and then make a list of things you want to do and you can talk to them over and over.

[contxt]	3 0 5 So i guess the point of this is for me to talk about what it is that I'm facing?  EOS 3 0 6 I have to have a brave face for everyone because I'm in charge of young people. I have to be strong for them, but it leaves me feeling exhausted  EOS 3 1 7 [Information] Being a father of two girls makes my skin cringe. Young people can be very challenging. Tell me more about this?  EOS 3 0 8 I teach special needs students, and they definitely make me happy. It's a very, very rewarding job. However, with political division and COVID, it's hard to reach this population. Parents are not supportive. I feel like I'm being stretched so thin.  EOS 3 0 9 I'm also a parent, and my son is doing virtual learning, so he's just as isolated.  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I remember a time where learning crisis management that taking a deep breath and meditating in the positive work that you are doing can open up your mind to suggestions from your inner self. Have you ever thought that you superb skills can transmit in your home as well?  EOS 3 0 11 Getting to that mindsight is challenging when the overwhelming feelings of 'failure' loom so heavily. I was seeing a therapist and making great strides, then he informed me that he was moving to a private practice. I cannot afford his sliding scale, and I feel let down. It's just that when one thing starts to go wrong, other things follow. Most of the time I see myself as a positive person that can work through challenging situations, but like you said it's a tough time for everyone  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So now that you understand that you have a awesome skill and that is being positive, build on this.

EOS 4 1 42 [Others] I don't think a huge change like that is neccessary, maybe just looking into options. Unemployment and government help until something else comes up.

EOS 1 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It's definitely frustrating to feel that your support system could possibly become a source of stress and competition anxiety. Especially since it's where we're supposed to feel safe and unjudged.  EOS 1 0 8 Exactly. They are supposed to be the people I can go to with my problems.

EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Do you think the anger you are feeling is directly a result of the situation? Do you feel the anger is manifested from somewhere else? I think it is important to get to the underlying source of the anger and take care of that first and foremost.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That's concerning, but very understandable. Are you able to financially seek additional help? Sometimes it's just what you need, as hard or embarrassing as that may seem. No one needs to know what you seek, but it is important not to disregard additional help, be it mental health, physical therapy, or just general prevention and detection from a PCP.  EOS 3 0 15 I feel that I am having trouble dealing with the fact that I am not able to do all the things I want to do. It is not an easy thing to lose your abilities when you feel so young but your body says otherwise.  EOS 3 0 16 I was in physical therapy but could not afford it any longer. So instead I purchased my own hot tub to be able to soak in and do some water exercises that may help me.  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] I think that's a normal way to feel and a frustrating part of growing older. I think focusing on positives and things you enjoy will help keep your mind away from thinking about "what used to be" or "what once was" - finding passions and joys in new things could help revitalize you. Can I help you find new hobbies or passions?

After the age of 10, I ended up living with my mother but I would spend most of my time with my friends because I enjoyed their company more than anything. I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well.

EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Very true, and it would likely be better with someone no quite so close to the situation. But you also don't have to attack him to her, just lay out the facts. I understand the frustration, it's hard to see your kids hurting or feeling like they're not enough. Is this the biggest issue you guys are dealing with in your marriage?

[contxt]	0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] For me, when I start getting overwhelmed and need to "debrief" my mind, and "declutter" the stresses, I use a notepad. I jot down every detail I can that pops into mind. Every upcoming task, everything that has caused anxiety or similar, and then I prioritize them in an agenda. It seems tedious, however once you get a handle on scheduling, in my personal ex perience, it is easier to hold yourself accountable and slowly work your way through accomplishments, even small tasks, which is encouraging to continue.  EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Sometimes, something as small as an accomplished task can uplift a mood greatly. Especially when listed and checked off to see the progress.  EOS 0 0 9 Thank you. That seems helpful. I tend to make excuses for myself when I feel like this and allow myself to slip in other areas of my life. For example if I am stressed, I tend to eat unhealthy food. Overall its hard to juggle all things I want to do and be at once. I will plan to make a list and check off some small things.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] When you visually see your success, I hope it will help like it does for myself. I personally believe that it is a useful tool, depression runs deep and anxiety pushes it over the edge with deadlines. Life and Personal are very complicated situations. As is living, in itself. Small accomplishments, maybe with minor rewards to yourself as you go, boosts confidence and tends to fade out the overwhelming heavy feelings.  EOS 0 0 11 What do you consider to be a minor reward that would be a good tool for me today?  EOS 0 0 12 I have created a list and was able to check one thing off already. This has helped some and I feel a little more relieved.  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] A punch card. If you have one handy, a note card/index card. Draw maybe, 15 circles around the edge, and call it "My rewards" In the middle, choose one thing you enjoy, for instance, if you like an ice cream sundae, put that in the middle. For your first task, just jot all that is on your mind down, and also use that as the first task to yourself. Check off one circle, and once you hit 15 get that sundae!  EOS 0 1 14 [Others] Awesome! I am happy to hear that it has already helped a little! 
[reference_response]	[Others] Awesome! I am happy to hear that it has already helped a little!
[hypothesis_response]	[Information] that sounds like a great idea, i think it would help to have a list of small tasks to remember for yourself. i also like to pick up a large cookie in the background, and i also pick a snack, and it's a good way to keep myself busy.

[contxt]	1 0 5 Yes it is and then she began avoiding me while we were in the same house, so we started arguing again and I found out she's been lying to me since I've known her and I'm very upset.  EOS 1 1 6 [Self-disclosure] That's definitely very upsetting. I know how it feels to have that sense of betrayal from a friend I was close to for many years. However, I was able to discuss the issue I had with my parents and other friends. Do you have anyone else close to you that you can talk to?  EOS 1 0 7 I don't think so, my parents think I was too harsh by deciding to end the friendship, it as if my own family doesn't understand.  EOS 1 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] That can definitely add to frustration. What about your other friends? Do you have anyone who either shares the same opinion as you or does not know your friend that you can talk to?  EOS 1 0 9 My other friend believed that it wasn't too harsh to end the friendship as they know I value honesty but it makes me feel angry that I was being used for so long and constantly lied to.  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] You have every right to be angry, but the most important thing you can do is find a good support system with your other friend. It will take some time to heal, but I'll tell you a paraphrased version of one of my favorite quotes: "Resentment is like swallowing poison and expecting the other person to die." It's important to find support in your other friends and heal properly.  EOS 1 0 11 I really love that quote, it's absolutely true; I think I will talk to my friend about the situation some more so I can fully get over it.  EOS 1 1 12 [Others] That sounds like a wonderful idea. Is there anything else you would like to discuss?

EOS 2 0 4 Yes, I have a lot of coursework but I have no help from from my advisors. A few of my peers feel the same way. Not sure what to do. I don't believe remote learning is helpful in a master program because the professor/advisor are not always available.  EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see how this can be stressful for you and your fellow peers. Have you tried other steps besides the one's you tried before by contacting the professor?  EOS 2 0 6 I tried, but the coursework is difficult and the other solution is tutorials on youtube but there is so much you can do on your own. Plus I have a job as well, so limited hours  EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I can relate to this because it is hard to work and do school as well.

EOS 1 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] I think rather than ask her that question directly, you could start the conversation and ask her why she is feeling this way. This would show you care and are prepared to listen without jumping to conclusions.  EOS 1 0 27 I think I do need to calm down a bit and maybe talking to her would be the best way to start. I don;t know what I'd do though if she ended it.  EOS 1 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] The best thing to do would be prepared to have the conversation, stay calm and listen. She may just want to talk but also be prepared as it may not go the way you plan.  EOS 1 0 29 Ok well maybe if I show her that I can stay calm and strong then she will stay with me?  EOS 1 1 30 [Information] Be prepared that she may end the relationship but getting angry is likely not to change her mind. Getting angry does not improve difficult conversations.  EOS 1 0 31 I suppose I could go into it and listen as you have said, there could be other reasons like the new job or maybe morning in that is causing some of it. I'll try and keep calm but it is hard when emotions run high.  EOS 1 1 32 [Providing Suggestions] Take a deep breath and try to relax beforehand.

EOS 0 0 22 Yes, and both of those are major goals of mine. But the stress sometimes feels inevitable.  EOS 0 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] Sometimes stress is inevitable.

EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I like going to the gym alone but that's just my personal preference. There are fitness groups like bootcamps that you could join and meet new people. Who knows, you may meet a new friend.  EOS 3 0 13 That is a good idea. I need to be around other people who have goals like weight loss. My boyfriend never wanted me to join groups and only wanted me to be friends with his family. That is why I am so alone right now. I made bad choices.  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds hard. You deserve to have friends of your own.  EOS 3 0 15 I agree with you. Do you think that I should try calling his friends and asking for his new number?  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] there are lots of different kinds of groups you can join, not just fitness. and you can choose how much you want to actively engage with them. I would suggest taking time for yourself. Maybe give yourself some distance from him. If you both decide to reach out again in the future that may be an opportunity, but definitely take care of you.  EOS 3 0 17 Yeah, I can see your point of view. I have been obsessed with our relationship. We had a fight and it was a verbal war between us and he wouldn't forgive me afterwards.  EOS 3 1 18 [Others] sometimes you just need some distance. I hate that old saying but as it goes "there are plenty of fish in the sea". 
[reference_response]	[Others] sometimes you just need some distance. I hate that old saying but as it goes "there are plenty of fish in the sea".

When I was in school same thing happened with mw. They know us very well I realized now. Try to talk to them everyday for a while. It might work.  EOS 0 0 12 Maybe you're right!

[situation]	My set of friends with include 6 close women are falling apart because of not communicating often and not being physically close to one another. It is really weird how being apart from one another can really change strong relationships. I am still close with everyone but I can not say the same about everyone else. We have all known each other for 25 years and it makes me sad and anxious that when we come out corona it won't be the same. Specifically, two of my besties are arguing with each other over a piece of sensitive gossip that was shared outside our group. Someone feels betrayed and I want to help them both without taking sides.

She also told me I need to get tested because her sister told her she and my fiance has been having an affair. I didn't believe her or the whole situation so I confronted my fiance. I knew he would tell this was all a lie but why was he there and before me? He didn't deny or confirm anything he kept saying he was Sorry.

Dealing with uncertainty during the pandemic is extremely difficult, as there are so many unforeseen circumstances.

[contxt]	1 0 0 Hello there.  EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Good evening . How can I help you  EOS 1 0 2 I'm having a problem with one of my friends.  EOS 1 1 3 [Question] So you are having issues with your friend? That is upsetting . What is the issue?  EOS 1 0 4 She has been having a problem with a different friend for years. I have been listening to these problems for all of that time. And even though it's so frustrating, because it's the same problem over and over again, I keep listening because she's my friend. But lately I have been going through a lot, and I haven't had as much time to sit and listen to these same problems, and she gets so angry telling me I don't care about her. The problems I've been going through are very serious, and I just don't have time to sit on the phone listening to the same stuff I've been dealing with for years.  EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand how angry unappreciated and burnt out you must be feeling. I would feel that way too  EOS 1 0 6 It's been really rough. I've tried so hard to be there for her, and I feel like she just doesn't even appreciate it.  EOS 1 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I don't think she is a place to be able to see anyone but herself. She is self centereed self asbored and self pity party and doesn't care about anyone but herself right now . Is that accurate? 
[reference_response]	[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I don't think she is a place to be able to see anyone but herself. She is self centereed self asbored and self pity party and doesn't care about anyone but herself right now . Is that accurate?

I don't do anything bad with them.  EOS 1 0 17 Some of my friends are so good they even inspire me to be better everyday.  EOS 1 1 18 [Self-disclosure] My mom told me similar concerns before. It is understandable.  EOS 1 0 19 All I need is to find a way to show her that I can make some good decisions as well and that she can trust me to make good friends. I have never gotten into trouble before with my friends  EOS 1 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] My suggestion is that tell her these facts and she can make a better decision.

EOS 3 0 9 The child is with us every other week and maybe that is why he treats him differently but my husband knows that it is causing problems in our relationship and refuses to change those behaviors. I just do not know what to do anymore.  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Is there someone that's close to both of you that you could talk to, that way they can help him see that it's very apparent that he's treating him different?  EOS 3 0 11 I suppose I could talk to his mother. But, I have reservations because I feel like she will side with him since it his her son.  EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Very true, and it would likely be better with someone no quite so close to the situation. But you also don't have to attack him to her, just lay out the facts. I understand the frustration, it's hard to see your kids hurting or feeling like they're not enough. Is this the biggest issue you guys are dealing with in your marriage?  EOS 3 1 13 [Others] Or is it just another thing you're not getting along on?  EOS 3 0 14 That is very true. This is our main issue. I suppose I need to find someone who is close to us both but not necessarily a family member.  EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Someone who has seen you interacting as a family and maybe has noticed it as well.

Are there any clubs or groups associated with your major? That way, you have some common ground to work with.  EOS 7 0 12 I'm honestly not sure, I guess I've always been too nervous to reach out to anyone. I'll have to have a look.  EOS 7 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] That sounds like a good idea =) Even if you can't hold club meetings on campus or have any gatherings, maybe they hold their meetings over video calls. One plus side to that, is that you don't need to have your camera on to participate.  EOS 7 0 14 That's true. I also feel a bit nervous about my final grades, I've done well so far but just feel like this year might mess everything up.  EOS 7 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's understandable, especially with how the past year has been. Everyone is on edge and everything feels so uncertain, but that's okay, because you're not alone =)

[situation]	Ever since the insurgent of Covid-19 ,I was hit hard when I was relieved from my full-time job for a non justifiable reason. I blame it to Covid because business was slow and it affected production. I was so frustrated and I didn't know what next to do as I had past due bills and family to take care of. I started applying for government benefits none was fast coming forth and requires a lot of processing time. I later got a part-time job that the pay was low and i could not put up with the bills .it was really tough. I almost went into depression but I did not give up home. Recently I got a full-time job but I have been scared and anxious because they keep laying off employees weekly. I wouldn't want to go through the terrible situation I had last time.

It's epidemic in our society now. However, you can pray for them and look for ways to keep your life on track so you don't get lost focusing on them and not where you want to go.

Maybe you can write that on your list -- perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that. That way you open up yourself to make new friends.

Most of the time I see myself as a positive person that can work through challenging situations, but like you said it's a tough time for everyone  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So now that you understand that you have a awesome skill and that is being positive, build on this. What building blocks can you write down that has helped you pushed through the fire and keep it some where close to you to always give you piece of mind and reinforce your habits of pushing through the fire.  EOS 3 0 13 Well, I am not one for journaling or anything. I try to stay active. I am about 6 months into remission from stage 4 HL (cancer) and it's been quite the emotional journey there. With that said, the mental and physical overhaul left quite a dent in my overall feelings about myself. I'm just now able to run again and in the past week I ran 2 5k's. To me, this was monumental and made me feel great. I'm also learning how to not overextend myself. I just keep hoping for continued improvement in all areas. The reinforcement is just that I can get through this, these feelings are only temporary.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] I totally understand that you are not for writing things down to keep. Yet, you have gone through a alot of events in your life where other would have given up. The key is transmitting your successes regardless of the situations. COVID is not going anywhere and as a person who has beaten stage 4 cancer, it is scary to be living in these times. You are doing monumental things, never forget that because your feelings and stamina for living will bind everything together. Politics, is the dirtiest and no government can solve and will solve the problems in the world.  EOS 3 0 15 thank you for listening. It helps to sometimes just get it out there.

I have been excelling in my role and went from part time employee with no benefits at 40hrs a week, but since I have a applied for our security team I was denied because I took the full time position and have to wait another 4 months.

EOS 1 0 6 Correct, when I took the position my manager said that I could transfer after six months.

This might be a non-threatening way to test out how they are feelng about you. You might be pleasantly surprised, and find that goes well.  EOS 2 0 18 One friend offered me to go for a drink tonight but I haven't replied yet. And also I don't want to talk about my ex at all, that's what I am afraid he can ask.  EOS 2 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] the other thing is these common friends might feel a bit awkard too about the situation. They have to figure out how to relate to you both on your own, it's a change of dynamics, so might take a bit of time to settle out. Can you tell your friend that you'd like to go out for a drink but that you don't feel comfortable talking about your ex at all? Would your friend respect your request if you made one do you think?

[contxt]	4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love  EOS 4 0 18 That's exactly it. So do you think I should just talk to her and tell her how I feel? The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience.  EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just "kicking her to the curb." Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard  EOS 4 0 20 Yes, I think I need to emphasize the friends element of it and potentially support her to move on. I suppose I'm fearful that it will never end but I'll need to face into that and stay strong, and obviously avoid being intimate as this would really hurt her if I continued to sleep with her. I need to be careful about that I think!  EOS 4 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, I can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it. But I think you are going to be able to do that just fine!  EOS 4 0 22 I must say, you have been fantastic to talk to about this, we have had a similar experience so I think the advice is coming from experience. Thanks for that!  EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] What I've gathered about you as a person, makes me confident that you probably chose a partner that will be able to have this talk with you and you both will come to an understanding.

EOS 2 1 12 [Information] I found that spending less time on social media and less time watching the news has helped my anxiety level to an extent. I don't think you should completely stop listening to what's going on as it's important to stay informed, but for me, limiting the amount of time that I spend engaging in these activities really helped.  EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about limiting how much time you spend tuning into news sources and especially on social media? I know it's hard because there isn't much to do.  EOS 2 0 14 yes but what can i do if am not spending time on it  EOS 2 0 15 there is not much option now i can't go out also  EOS 2 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] Have you considered spending your time engaging in other hobbies? I've been doing a lot of arts and crafts (one in particular called diamond painting that can be ordered directly from Amazon) and also reading novels that I can also have delivered right to my door. This also prevents me from having to go out in public.  EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Talking to me about how you're feeling is a great start!

EOS 2 0 7 I think the biggest problem is that I keep wondering what his new girlfriend is like and if she is prettier or cleverer than me. I do not know what I did wrong.  EOS 2 1 8 [Others] You did nothing wrong. It's something wrong with him, if he did this to you, he'll probably do it again to her. Do you really want to be with someone that disregards your well being like that?  EOS 2 0 9 That is a very sensible way to look at things .. I do rationally realise that.

EOS 1 0 13 I think he will be apologetic. He has always treated me fairly. It is difficult for me to put my anger aside sometimes, which is why I have not said anything yet. I am afraid I will not remain calm and might say something mean to him. That would be terrible.  EOS 1 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are nervous about saying something mean.

[contxt]	3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You're absolutely right that sometimes there is a need for medication. My mother suffers from depression as do I. She has to take Effexor everyday for her condition. I, however went through COUNTLESS combinations and never found a relief as helpful as when I write and talk to people.  EOS 3 0 17 I also went through a lot of different combinations before ending on on Prozac. I think that different things work for different people. I do not find it very easy to talk to people.  EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Have you explored other theraputic avenues to synchronize with the medication?  EOS 3 0 19 No, I am rather way of 'natural' or homeopathic medicine. Are there any kinds that you could recommend?  EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You're doing VERY well talking to me! Had you not said anything, I would have assumed that to be the best choice! But if you're an introvert, then my first suggestion is to journal.  EOS 3 0 21 I do do a lot of that but I would feel too shy to show anyone my journal. Your help has been invaluable though and I do feel more receptive to other forms of treatment now.  EOS 3 1 22 [Question] That way you can reflect on what you've written and possibly learn patterns, triggers, moodswings and other information that would help the problem.

EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] That is a good idea. I would go over your resume and spruce it up before talking to them on Wednesday to add in anything pertinent that you might have learned or achieved during your time with the company these last two years. Make sure the day you approach them that you're well rested, clean and put together. Google some confidence stances and pay attention to your posture. Even if you're feeling nervous there are ways to hide it and appear confident.  EOS 0 0 7 Wow, that's really good advice. Thanks. I didn't think about updating my resume, and I really should have thought about it.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] No problem, I hope it helps.  EOS 0 0 9 Should I talk with my coworker about it?

[contxt]	3 1 7 [Question] Well I had to sit down and think about why I was stuck and tried to come up with as many options as I could to be unstuck, then i put them in order based on which I thought would work best. It took quite a few of them, but I did finally get unstuck.  EOS 3 0 8 I can try doing that.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Every one is different, but it is worth a shot, might help the rut your having, might also give you new ideas that will help you decide on how to not feel like your in a rut anymore. Sometimes just talking to someone can help too, bouncing ideas off of each other can help in some cases.  EOS 3 0 10 True, I have been avoiding most people.  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Its hard to talk about certain problems, so I can't blame you, however you can get some good ideas from others. You might have just needed some space to evaluate your situation, nothing wrong with taking a break from things or people if it helps you.  EOS 3 0 12 I will try reaching out to my sister tomorrow. maybe she can help.  EOS 3 0 13 I also feel embarrassed that I feel so unhappy.  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] From chatting with you I can tell you might be ready to start talking and maybe get some help or advice, family is a great start they are typically a great support system. It is okay to feel embarrassed but being unhappy will eat at you, sometimes its good to set our pride aside so that we can figure things out. In my situation of feeling stuck I was ashamed that I sat and let people treat me so badly but it wasn't until I seen it as a problem that I started making my lists and getting advice. Some things we do on our own and some its good to have people to help. I think reaching out to your sister would be worth a try, she might also have different ideas and suggestions you haven' t thought of yet.

Even if you begin by doing it robotically, eventually your mind and heart will want to be more sincerely grateful. I have in the past challenged myself to find five things to be grateful for in the morning and write them down. Whether those things are "I have hot coffee and electricity" or "I won $1000 for free", they will begin to start a small fire of joy.

[contxt]	3 0 15 That's a good question. My state is still one of the ones that's mostly shut-down. Part of my depression surely stems from the fact that all evening/weekend activities ended a year ago as well.  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] True. It might be easier to work at home when you have a chance to get out of the house during your free time.  EOS 3 0 17 That's true. And your suggestion of improving my work space is a good one. I've been working in a modified walk-in closet. I've tried to make it inviting, but there are no windows/etc.... it's kind of a dark cave.  EOS 3 1 18 [Information] Most people didn't plan for the long term because nobody thought that this was a sustainable way to work. By the way, if your company wants you to stay home, then it might help buy the equipment you need to be productive.  EOS 3 0 19 That's a good thought. My computer is set-up on a folding card table. (I tried finding a desk a while back, but there was a huge shortage since everyone suddenly had to buy them for themselves, kids, etc.). I hadn't thought of asking my company to buy me one. Plus a more comfy chair could improve my attitude.  EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] I think if you talk to your co-workers, they'll have ideas for upgrading your workspace.

You received lessons from both the past relationships and can take that forward knowing what you wish for and deserve.  EOS 4 0 20 Thank you for letting me talk about this. It is a touchy topic, affairs. My heart was so loved during that time but I always told him that if he needed me to step back, I would. It has been difficult on both of us.  EOS 4 0 21 Being a parent, having the families meshed together, homes, work, etc.... I can understand why he feels he should try again.  EOS 4 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] Sometimes talking about why you are feeling is the best way to find closure. Keep the memories of the love and good times but know that in the end you were destined for something so much more. As adults we try so often to find happiness in others. He is a good person for wanting to try to resolve the situation for his family but that does not mean he did not love you or that your relationship was not a bright spot in his life as it was yours.

[contxt]	1 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I would certainly agree with you. That kind of work is unsustainable. Let me ask you this. What would happen if you told your employer you simply could not do these hours?  EOS 1 0 13 hah - i dunno. im on a team of 2 people - and i guess if i dont do it, the other person has to. or it just doesnt get done, and i dont know what happens?? nothing? LOL.  EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] The worst that could happen is that they fire you. But that doesn't seem too likely as they seem to need you. But I have learned in life that if I don't care for myself, hardly anyone does. We need to be kind to ourselves. Set boundaries.  EOS 1 0 15 agreed - i dont think they would fire me, maybe get reprimanded or more likely a guilt trip as to why I cant do it. Im just not sure what kind of boundaries I set when we have things due, and just literally no time.  EOS 1 1 16 [Information] Setting boundaries can be difficult if you haven't done that a lot. When we think we don't have the ability to say NO, then we feel trapped, worn out, depressed, taken advantage of. People need to know that we reasonably can say no.  EOS 1 0 17 Well, I have to set boundaries, because working till 11pm most nights is not sustainable. and who on earth is going to view, let alone sign a contract at 12am  EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I think that would be the first step. Determine how many hours you feel you COULD work. Then advise them that is what you will do. Find out what kind of timelines there are, and if you can't do it, don't go beyond your boundaries. It is obviously destroying your life. It really isn't healthy for you.  EOS 1 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] Exactly. It isn't working for you. Something has to change. And you sound intelligent, so you can determine what will work for you -- perhaps a range of hours, but definitely not 14 hours. Unless you are a young kid. lol Even then, that's a lot.

[hypothesis_response]	[Providing Suggestions] if you think that it is unhealthy, and they are going to see your efforts as negative, they need to see that you are doing what you need to do. they need you to be able to make a list of how many people you should hire, and that is your first step, and you need them to see what kind you want to do and not push yourself back.

EOS 3 0 14 well, it's only today they brought the limit to social gatherings from 10 to 5.  EOS 3 1 15 [Others] have you tried reaching out to mayor's office to see if there is any way you could request for more restrictions. most of the cities do have a hotline or a channel for residents to give suggestions or request something  EOS 3 0 16 too slow and they don't believe in shutting down essential businesses when that will stop it once and for all after two or three weeks. They did that earlier this year for the first wave and that pretty much did the trick.

[contxt]	1 0 4 My friend created a group chat for planning activities and did not include me. She included people who are closer to me than to her. Almost like she is trying to steal my friends.  EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. So when she did this, it gave you the feeling of almost being replaced or abandoned by your own social circle?  EOS 1 0 6 In a way. I was disappointed by the rest of them but mostly angry at her. It almost feels like she wants to be the leader of the group and feels like I am her competition.  EOS 1 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It's definitely frustrating to feel that your support system could possibly become a source of stress and competition anxiety. Especially since it's where we're supposed to feel safe and unjudged.  EOS 1 0 8 Exactly. They are supposed to be the people I can go to with my problems. Now I feel like they all had a secret which I wasn't privy to and it made me feel disconnected and untrusting towards them.  EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds that you're a person who really does care about keeping the relationships they've invested in healthy and open. That care level can definitely cause natural anxiousness in situations like this, when the place you stand with them and what they're thinking suddenly feels uncertain.  EOS 1 0 10 I am a bit of an idealist. I like for everyone to be in harmony, to be nice, supportive, caring, open and honest. I don't know how to move on from this.  EOS 1 1 11 [Information] Right, and there are endless possibilites the mind can create outside of ideal. But funnily enough, the imagination of an idealist that lets them visualize great things can also create equally strong fears before getting answers.

First of all, can I ask if he is just your friend online or if you hangout with him in person too?  EOS 5 0 9 That's correct. He is actually a close friend and I wonder what has changed recently to make him like this. I've known him for over 20 years.  EOS 5 1 10 [Others] Okay I see. From personal experience, the best way to confront someone who likes to do most of their confrontations online, is in person. Since he is so used to almost "hiding" behind a screen, his feelings will be more vulnerable and real if you discuss your concerns in person.  EOS 5 0 11 Actually I've never thought of it like that. Perhaps a couple of us can have a conversation with him in person. Honestly some off his views are disgusting. I think this needs to stop.  EOS 5 1 12 [Information] A suggestion I would make would be to hangout with him in person, and bring up the issues that you and your friends have been seeing. But it's important to not make him feel overwhelmed. Almost like he is being "ganged up on."  EOS 5 0 13 Yes that's good advice, I think we need to be tactful and raise it in the right way. Have you ever experienced something like this with a friend yourself?  EOS 5 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you care about this person as a friend, but you are worried that the way he thinks and talks may ruin that in a way.

[hypothesis_response]	[Providing Suggestions] yes, i have experienced it in a similar way! it is hard to move on, but i think it is worth trying. if he knows how to work around the issue, he will come back to his normal behavior. if the other person doesn't want to talk to him, then i would suggest that you sit down and tell them that you have been talking to you, but they will want to work through things with you first.

I'm trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won't ever find anyone.  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you're doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another.  EOS 3 0 13 Thank you! Exactly. But it is scary. I am guessing from your name that you identify as male (please forgive me if that is incorrect), so you might not understand what it feels like to be an older woman when your ex starts dating someone a lot younger. Men only get better and more desirable with age, not so for women.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] I might not understand that particular aspect, but self worth is still self worth no matter the context. I'd say try not to pay any mind to what he's up to. The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence, but if you just focus on watering your grass (making yourself happy) then you'll have a much more fulfilling life.  EOS 3 0 15 Haha, watering my own grass. That is a good way to put it. Thank you for talking to me for a few minutes.

EOS 4 0 13 yes i've been in a relationship with her for three years  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] If she has moved on from you, as painful as it is, you should move on from her. But that will take time, and it will help to slowly and methodically find a way forward from her. You should not feel like it will happen overnight or that quickly, but distractions and creating a new path for yourself are imperative.

They are certainly not any reason to be angry with yourself. If I may bring up another cliché: "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me." I would say you're in the "fool me once" stage and it is your friend's actions that have brought you pain. I think you're unlikely to trust her again.  EOS 1 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Also, hindsight is 20/20. What you might see now in ways that your friend might have used you are things that you might not have seen then.

I started applying for government benefits none was fast coming forth and requires a lot of processing time. I later got a part-time job that the pay was low and i could not put up with the bills .it was really tough. I almost went into depression but I did not give up home.

Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health  EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] I also recommend making an educational plan.

[contxt]	3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] My husband and I actually have worked with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. We are retired now, but still volunteer. Sometimes we have to let go of our loved ones - they have to hit rock bottom. Very hard to do, but unless they see their behavior as destructive, they don't want to change.  EOS 3 0 10 I agree, I'm afraid that's what I have to do. Another one of our mutual friends passed away recently to an overdose. I don't want to lose another friend.  EOS 3 1 11 [Others] Have you seen the serenity prayer? Knowing what to do, what not to do and accepting life really is a great thing to ask God for. We can't change others. Yet you have to find a way to have peace.  EOS 3 0 12 Yes. I know I have to let go. I've punished myself trying to stay in his life.  EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] It's very hard to lose friends to addictions. It's epidemic in our society now. However, you can pray for them and look for ways to keep your life on track so you don't get lost focusing on them and not where you want to go.  EOS 3 0 14 all drugs are bad, but meth is a truly evil drug.  EOS 3 0 15 It's just rotting his soul and body. He believes he can't stop and you're right, letting go and just sending prayers is all i can really do now  EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] very evil, I agree, I like to write out a list of things I can do to distract myself from overly being concerned, if that makes sense. Like I take time to think about them and pray for them, then I have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where I want to go and how to get there. Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol

EOS 4 0 9 I have never tried because I'm too anxious to stay still for longer periods of time.  EOS 4 0 10 I mean I have tried but its not easy.  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Having high anxiety makes it very hard to concentrate on meditation. I take a medication for anxiety that has helped me a lot.

EOS 4 0 13 I know its hard to help me, I just feel better by talking to someone.  EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm really sorry you weren't able to get relief with medication.

EOS 2 0 16 Yes, it is really much more easy to write my problems down than to actually talk to people about them face to face.  EOS 2 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] One suggestion is for you to write down all the reasons that you love microbiology. It can be any format, I love a bubble chart (mind map), it could be in list form or just doodles, would this be something you would find useful?  EOS 2 0 18 Yes, that is a fantastic idea!

EOS 0 1 28 [Others] I am so incredibly sorry that you have to deal with all of this at all but especially at the start of the holiday season. My heart absolutely breaks for you.  EOS 0 1 29 [Self-disclosure] Yes, we have a daughter. He spent the first eight years of her life in prison. I gave her the choice as to whether or not she wanted to get to know him. He had plenty of opportunities to speak to her and chose not to call or show up when he was supposed to. The last thing she said about him was, "All he does is lie to me and break promises. I don't want to see him or talk to him anymore."  EOS 0 0 30 And no I haven't thought or going to therapy. I'm not the one who cheated on anyone and this just happened Friday.

I left the store and rushed to the hospital. When I got there my friend’s family members and my fiance were already there. My best friend sister greeted me and she told me my best friend has AIDS and has not been taking her medicine. I'm her best friend and I can't believe she didn't tell me. She was fine Thursday when I last saw her. The sister also told me the doctors said she could die at any moment because she has advance Kidney failure. She also told me I need to get tested because her sister told her she and my fiance has been having an affair. I didn't believe her or the whole situation so I confronted my fiance. I knew he would tell this was all a lie but why was he there and before me? He didn't deny or confirm anything he kept saying he was Sorry.

[contxt]	6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] A lot of people I know benefited from talking to an advisor or counselor for some direction. Have you done that recently?  EOS 6 0 16 I talked to the school counselor. They laid out some options. It's really about money and time. If those weren't concerns, I would switch in a heartbeat.  EOS 6 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] What about meeting with the counselor with your parents, since it seems they would need to support you financially over any extra time it might take?  EOS 6 0 18 That's a good point. Maybe we could have a Zoom meeting, even for just 15 minutes. I need to get my parents to understand my feelings.  EOS 6 0 19 The counselor might help me with that.  EOS 6 1 20 [Information] It's been shown that healthy communication can help people listen and respond more considerately when things seem difficult at first.  EOS 6 0 21 I hadn't thought of it that way. I'm so worried about schoolwork that I hadn't stepped back from the whole situation of school itself.

EOS 4 0 15 No I am stuck going into work, we are essential enough to stay open  EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Ah, I also know some essential workers who must physically attend work. I am lead to believe that the pandemic inadvertently causes a lot of stress in places that we don't commonly associate stress with. For example, wearing a mask everywhere for us in the United States can become a pain sometimes like when I forget it in the car or the house  EOS 4 0 17 Yes honestly covid has definitely been exhausting. masks have been mandatory here for quite some time so I am never without one  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I don't blame you, its impossible to keep this composure especially with a pandemic breathing down our necks. When I worked, I found that smaller problems that wouldn't normally phase me began to have a greater effect when the pandemic hit  EOS 4 1 19 [Others] Thus my stress went up as a result and wearing a mask didn't help the problem  EOS 4 0 20 Honestly I wear a mask 8 hours a day and its not a big deal  EOS 4 1 21 [Question] Hmm I guess we all deal with the precautionary measure differently.

EOS 2 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] the other thing is these common friends might feel a bit awkard too about the situation. They have to figure out how to relate to you both on your own, it's a change of dynamics, so might take a bit of time to settle out. Can you tell your friend that you'd like to go out for a drink but that you don't feel comfortable talking about your ex at all? Would your friend respect your request if you made one do you think?

EOS 0 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind.

I have felt stuck many times, so i can understand that.  EOS 3 0 6 What did you do to get out of the rut.  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Well I had to sit down and think about why I was stuck and tried to come up with as many options as I could to be unstuck, then i put them in order based on which I thought would work best. It took quite a few of them, but I did finally get unstuck.  EOS 3 0 8 I can try doing that.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Every one is different, but it is worth a shot, might help the rut your having, might also give you new ideas that will help you decide on how to not feel like your in a rut anymore. Sometimes just talking to someone can help too, bouncing ideas off of each other can help in some cases.  EOS 3 0 10 True, I have been avoiding most people.  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Its hard to talk about certain problems, so I can't blame you, however you can get some good ideas from others.

I think a lot of people are not getting the medical help that they need because of the virus  EOS 5 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Please do not beat yourself up over this - it does sound as though you have done absolutely everything you could to help.

And tell her that you want to work with her to have the most efficient partnership possible and use each of your talents to the best of your ability. Then you can lay out how you work best and see where it goes from there.  EOS 1 0 14 Thanks! I will try that. You made me feel so much better!  EOS 1 1 15 [Others] I'm so glad, these can be frustrating situations but sometimes it's worth looking at the other person's perspective.  EOS 1 0 16 I agree. Sometimes you just have to take a step back and have a conversation with someone not in the thick of it.  EOS 1 1 17 [Information] Absolutely, I have no emotional stake in this.

[contxt]	3 0 4 Does that really help? How do you start?  EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions] I am glad you asked. At first, it can seem a little difficult. But the key is to start small and build as you go. For example, allocating 10 minutes after lunch or borrowing some time off of social media.  EOS 3 0 6 What exactly do you? How can it help me make decisions without getting anxious?  EOS 3 1 7 [Information] From what I know, you can try to relax before making any decision. I usually follow my intuition and decide. I deal with the outcome later. But meditating has really helped me avoid anxiety.  EOS 3 0 8 I often feel like I'm just going to mess up anyways so I don't see the point in even trying sometimes.

I was thinking about talking with them Wednesday this week. They are meeting on Thursday.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] That is a good idea. I would go over your resume and spruce it up before talking to them on Wednesday to add in anything pertinent that you might have learned or achieved during your time with the company these last two years. Make sure the day you approach them that you're well rested, clean and put together. Google some confidence stances and pay attention to your posture. Even if you're feeling nervous there are ways to hide it and appear confident.  EOS 0 0 7 Wow, that's really good advice. Thanks. I didn't think about updating my resume, and I really should have thought about it.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] No problem, I hope it helps.  EOS 0 0 9 Should I talk with my coworker about it?

I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I'm too scared to do anything about it as I don't want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can't help it  EOS 6 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through.  EOS 6 0 5 Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I'm a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are.  EOS 6 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well.

I had to break down and talk to him about it  EOS 6 0 7 What happened out of interest when you had the conversation?  EOS 6 1 8 [Others] Ignoring this will NOT help things.

[contxt]	0 0 2 I've been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn't go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction.  EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint?  EOS 0 0 4 Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don't have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions.  EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.  EOS 0 0 6 Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products.  EOS 0 0 7 I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract.

EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Just think of all of the ways our kids are learning to adapt to different life situations as well. That's worth just as much as their formal education. Your concerns are valid, and hopefully finding another safer school works out and this whole thing is over soon.  EOS 4 0 17 I have been trying to do projects at home I normally wouldn't to try to help everyone fill time. Things like creating websites, art projects, and such. Those skills will help tremendously.  EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] That's a great idea, helping fill time with things to distract is a good way to relieve stress as well.  EOS 4 0 19 So, I guess I'll just keep doing what I can and try to stay away from media and the state's tracking site.

If you like the individuals' personality and if they seem genuine then you can seek a stronger connection.  EOS 4 0 8 I think it's because I like anime. Maybe people hate me for it. You know, they call us "weebs" and make fun of us...  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Anime you say? I love anime as well!

But, I am worried that they may insist on me attending as we get closer to the holidays and in some ways I feel guilty because it isn't just the pandemic that makes me not want to go. I usually don't feel great during holidays with my family and I think they are harmful to me overall  EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you feel.
