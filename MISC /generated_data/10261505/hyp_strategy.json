  "and worse cases scenario, you might have a better time...",
  "it sounds like you really want to stay motivated and keep positive. i'm sure you can get by with a little bit of time to yourself.",
  "good luck!",
  "i hope you are able to get it done. i have a lot of faith in you!",
  "i think that it would be a good thing to have a support system for people like this. it might help to have some sort of support system in place.",
  "that is great. it seems like you have been getting a lot more help with your anxiety.",
  "you're welcome. i hope you can get through this!",
  "have you considered seeking a job until you get one?",
  "you may have to do some research on how to get them to the schools.",
  "i can tell you're stressed about everything right now but keep yourself busy!",
  "thank you. i have a lovely day as well!",
  "i have been doing online school for the past two weeks. i have a few friends who are doing online work too.",
  "no problem, i hope that i have been able to be of some help for you and i hope you can overcome this.",
  "that is a very tough situation. you should try to stay positive and keep yourself optimistic.",
  "i've been there, i can tell how difficult it is to make our own lives go away",
  "i hope you will feel better soon.",
  "i have been to a lot of tour dates. i like to go for a walk and do some shopping.",
  "it sounds to me like you've been very controlling.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i hope you find a way to cope and do not let it get to you.",
  "i'm glad i could help, i've been in a similar situation and i know how hard it is.",
  "i think you will get better",
  "i understand how that feels, especially since this is so close to being over.",
  "what do you think you'll do differently if you have to work from home?",
  "that's a great idea! you can meet new people with the same interest as yourself.",
  "i know what you mean about feeling overwhelmed. you are doing everything you can to get through this.",
  "you too!",
  "i would just say that you should try to focus on yourself and how you feel about them. it will make you a better person.",
  "i know that it can be stressful, but i think it is worth trying to put away the stress and take care of yourself.",
  "i think it might be helpful to start with a journal of how youre feeling and see if you can reach out to other people. you will not have to go into a ruhole or even go through the process of finding a new one, but if you want to be able to write a journal, you can do it with your own words.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i have felt this way myself. i took a long time to process everything in my life and i felt overwhelmed. i could never be there for my partner. i thought i would be alone, and i couldn't imagine going through that. how long have you been together?",
  "oh no!",
  "it is great for managing anxiety, i believe it is a great tool for the mind.",
  "it sounds like you have a really strong heart and will not take that kind of thing personally.",
  "i'll bet you'll have a great night. i hope you've had a wonderful day!",
  "well, you could also tell her that you are going to help her in a way that you think is good for you and that you do not think she would be hurt if she had to leave you alone.",
  "i've got a few questions for you...",
  "i think that's a great idea. i would also recommend trying to look online. they may have some free information on jobs you might be interested in.",
  "i know that you will have a great night. have a good rest of your day!",
  "well, i've been studying to be a doctor. i'd like to work on some kind of science. i have always wanted to be an expert in it!",
  "i hope that you have a wonderful day and i wish you all the best!",
  "oh yes!!! you are a good person and i believe you will find someone in the future",
  "i tried to find a job that was close to my work, and try to find the job that is more suitable for me.",
  "i know that is hard right now, but i believe you will get through this.",
  "that is a good idea, i think you are doing the right thing.",
  "you are so brave to say that. i can understand that you feel embarrassed about how you treated your cowerkers during the party, and that you really want to make the right choice for yourself.",
  "you could talk to her about it and tell her that you don't want to talk to you and you have a lot of issues with her. maybe she can give you some suggestions on how to address her issues.",
  "if you have anxiety about things, there are many strategies that can be used to help with it.",
  "it's been a great year for everyone!",
  "do you have any friends who can help you out?",
  "do you have any other hobbies that you can try to engage in, or do you think that maybe this could have been something that you could try to get to?",
  "i am glad you are here for her. i know how difficult this is, and it is a great thing that you are taking care of your daughter and that you recognize that you can support her in this difficult time.",
  "is there any way you could talk to her about the issue?",
  "it was my pleasure to help.",
  "i know, i have had a lot of hair cuts over the past couple of weeks and i have been getting them cut. i can't wait to get it done!",
  "i have been feeling a bit depressed myself. i would suggest seeking professional help.",
  "that is great! it's good that you are starting a new relationship and in your choice of guy.",
  "that is very good. you are very smart and very kind. i think you will be successful in the future",
  "i think that's great to hear.",
  "i have been there before",
  "i understand completely. i also have been in a similar situation. i had a lot of trauma and i was in a really bad place. i can relate.",
  "i pray that things will be better soon, but i think we will have to wait and see.",
  "i am not sure what that means?",
  "wow! that is a lot of time to spend with your new partner. i bet you are feeling a lot better.",
  "i have not tried any hard questions, but i have tried to wear a mask before and i had issues.",
  "yes, you can take walks or go to the park.",
  "you're welcome! i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.",
  "i would be upset too. i think bringing it to him would help.",
  "yes, i have an american accent. i love my american friends!",
  "i can see how that might help you a lot.",
  "i can understand how you are feeling right now. it seems like you're not feeling well.",
  "oh wow! that's a terrible feeling! i have been in a similar situation myself. i read a lot of old messages and found that it was really hard to come to terms with. i found that there was no need for a relationship at all. i thought it was going to be a good thing that i was able to make a better life choice.",
  "it sounds like you are very smart about it. i know it is difficult but i am sure you can do it.",
  "i am a professional in counseling. it was helpful for me when i was feeling depressed and couldn't do anything to myself and felt like i was doing everything i could to help others.",
  "have you tried any kind of medication that is helpful?",
  "i'd recommend trying to go out for a walk. you'll feel accomplished and have a good time.",
  "i would be furious too. i would not have been able to be around your mom.",
  "that's really hard to hear, i am so sorry to hear that. have you tried talking to your doctor or counselling about this?",
  "that's great! i am glad you are reaching out to help.",
  "bye.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what is your plan for the future?",
  "i'm glad to hear that. it sounds to me that your parents are taking good care of you and want you safe.",
  "oh i see, i am sorry you are feeling that way.",
  "i can see how that would be hard, i would suggest talking to her about these problems and explain why you feel that you are not being able to see her.",
  "it is a great way to release stress, i think it is one of the best ways to deal with stress.",
  "sometimes gift is better than not gift.",
  "i think it might be worth reaching out to your husband and seeing if he has any support from his family. it'd be easier to talk to him about his issues and his life and how he'll cope with them.",
  "if you do, i would end the conversation as quickly as possible.",
  "it definitely does. but if you know how to do it, it will all work out in the end.",
  "you're very welcome!",
  "glassgate is a good place to start, it is a free form of online learning.",
  "bye",
  "i use facebook myself, but i also use instagram and twitter.",
  "you are very welcome! i hope you feel better soon.",
  "how is it complicated?",
  "that'll be great. i've also heard of some people who were obese and felt the need to talk about how they felt. i think it's great that you found a way to see yourself through the bullying.",
  "i would try and make sure to bring up how you feel to him. if he does not respond, it could be a sign of depression.",
  "oh my! that is a long time. how have you been feeling?",
  "you are welcome. i wish you all the best.",
  "yes, i have a job right now. i have been working at home since i was 5. i also have a dog and cat.",
  "i've been in a similar situation. it'd be nice to have some support but it'll be tough. i'd suggest doing some research on scholarships and grants that you can apply for and see what kind of scholarships you'd like to use. you could find some counselling programs that might help.",
  "what are some things you would like to talk about?",
  "i can understand your frustration.",
  "yes that is a great idea. there are lots of online classes that will help you build your resume and get you a job.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "no problem. i hope i was able to help.",
  "i understand that you dont want to be hurt, but you should try to talk to someone who does not feel that way",
  "oh that is so hard. are you able to work from home?",
  "that is understandable. do you feel that you are being too hard on yourself?",
  "you sound intelligent and have a great head on your shoulders. i believe you will do great.",
  "you're welcome. i hope you can find some relief in the park.",
  "i understand that feeling. it seems like you are feeling a bit overwhelmed right now, but i think you can do this. keep your head up and look for another job.",
  "you've been through this before, and it is a really tough situation to be in.",
  "i think you have a good handle on this. it sounds like you have been able too!",
  "you can start again!",
  "i can understand that. i know i had a similar experience, however, when i was younger, i also had to look into a lot of options that i didn't have in life. i used to be able to control myself in the short term, but it is a bit harder now.",
  "i can tell that you are stressed and anxious. i would suggest talking to your professor about your anxiety. i think that would help.",
  "i can tell you have a lot of confidence in yourself, you will be fine.",
  "i'm sure he is nervous, but there are lots of people who are.",
  "i know you've got your head on straight. you can do it!",
  "i am glad you are seeking help!",
  "i think it would be a good idea to get a good counselling.. i went to a local mental health counselling and it was great... i recommend it.. you can find a great therapist there.. or you could use the online therapy program there are a lot of resources out there that help you with the tough times. )",
  "well thank you for listening! i hope you have a great day!",
  "i understand that, it sounds like you are having a hard time getting back to normal. it seems to me that you are feeling really bad about this, but it'll get better, and if you keep trying, you'll find someone who will appreciate your strength, and you will find someone that will treat you as well.",
  "yes it really is. it's great that it'll be coming back to the normal, and hopefully we'll see a vaccine soon.",
  "well i would be upset too, but it's good you are aware of what is going on",
  "do you have any other family members who might be able to help you with your financial situation?",
  "is there a way you could get a part time job at a grocery store or grocery store that would be able to provide you with some extra cash for your grandson's school?",
  "you can do it!",
  "well, i'd recommend that you try and do some outdoor activities to help you relax and get yourself back on track. maybe even taking a walk outside.",
  "i understand that. i am a student, and i know how difficult this is.",
  "you sound like a great person.",
  "i think that is a good start!",
  "have you tried talking to your school counselor about your issues?",
  "i think that you should do that.",
  "it sounds like you are doing great and that is good news! i have been studying and having a great time. i think you will be able to find something you really like!",
  "it is normal to feel that way. it will take time to find out.",
  "of course! we can't change the past",
  "no problem! have a great rest of your day!",
  "i am sorry. it sounds like your situation is very difficult. i am sure that there is someone out there that can provide you with information.",
  "you've got this!",
  "i've had that happen to me too, it's a really hard time for sure.",
  "you too! i am so glad that you have someone to talk to!",
  "do you have any other hobbies that you like to do?",
  "i've been trying to find a few online that have been helpful. there's also a great youtube video called \" mindcare \", which is a video about how to treat a cat to a treat.",
  "i understand. you are very fortunate to have such a supportive wife. i think that you should talk to her about it.",
  "i understand, i have been through a similar situation myself, i can tell you that this is a very difficult time.",
  "ok. i can understand how upset you are about this.",
  "i can imagine that you feel a little bit lonely with your friends, but i am sure that it has been very hard for you.",
  "that'll be a great way to get out of the house and get some fresh air. i think that'd help you a lot!",
  "you are very welcome. i am glad i could help.",
  "i understand that you have struggled with depression since childhood. have there been any talks you can make about it with your doctor?",
  "i can see how you are feeling and i understand that you have such a positive attitude.",
  "that's understandable.",
  "i can relate to that feeling. do you have any hobbies that you could try doing outside?",
  "i hear you.. i have had a couple of friends in the past who were in the same boat.. they are very worried about the future.",
  "that's a tough one, but i think you can find something you like.",
  "i am not sure what the actual answer is but i think it would be a good idea to get a therapist to talk about it. it can be helpful to be able to talk to people who can relate and provide advice on how to get through this difficult time.",
  "i think you are really doing great and doing great things on this year, and i know you will be proud of your success.",
  "you're welcome!",
  "i am sure you will be fine. i believe that the government will help you out in time and you will have some support.",
  "no problem! i wish you all the luck in the future!",
  "i have been in the same situation, and i think thats the case with most people. i try to be as calm as possible, and keep myself occupied with my work.",
  "i like to play online games, or read. i am a fan of strategy games, and i like reading games.",
  "that would be a good start.",
  "i understand how it feels. i also have been in a sorority home and i am not sure that i would trust that someone would be telling me that. but i know that in this world there is no harm in telling people that. i would think that it is very unlikely though.",
  "have you tried any different places that you could try to go?",
  "i hope everything works out for you and that you have a great christmas season.",
  "i think that is a good idea. you can always take them out if you feel like it.",
  "i can understand why you would feel this way. i'm sure you have a good plan and you are not alone in feeling that way.",
  "do you have anyone to talk to about it?",
  "i think that you should go for it and see if he is interested.",
  "you are most welcome. i hope you stay positive!",
  "i hope your friendship works out.",
  "you too!",
  "i am glad you are starting to be more positive. i think you are doing great. i am proud of you.",
  "i have been feeling the same way for a long time. i have a lot of friends who are going through the same thing as you and it is very hard for us to have a good relationship.",
  "i completely understand. it is hard to keep motivated when we are struggling with school.",
  "that is a great idea! i know it'll make you feel better to take a break from your daily life and play a game like that.",
  "you are very welcome. i hope you feel a little better soon.",
  "do you have any close friends?",
  "that sounds like a really good idea!",
  "i hope it will be helpful to you to get some help from the people who need it. i know you are doing great!",
  "you as well.",
  "that's a good idea!",
  "i think that is a great idea. you will get many more ideas",
  "well there's no harm in asking. i hope you find a way to get out of this situation.",
  "you can do that",
  "i know you are feeling a bit lonely right now but i believe you can find a new job",
  "if you are not feeling well, i suggest that you tell her that you think you are going to need a break from her and that you have to leave her behind.",
  "i think that's what's important, not what people think. the way you are feeling, that'll be a good thing.",
  "i've had a similar experience. i think it'd be good to be able to talk to someone about it, even if it'll take a long time. i'd suggest trying to talk with a therapist, even a professional. there is a lot of help out there.",
  "so she is taking advantage of you and you are being ignored.",
  "i can imagine that is very hard to do, but i really believe that things will work out for you. you have a great day!",
  "yeah i have two and they like playing with me. i also love star craft.",
  "is there anything else i can help you with today?",
  "good, i hope you will find a job soon!",
  "i think you have your head on straight, even if you dont feel confident about it",
  "i think you have got this. i wish you all the very best in the future.",
  "that sounds really hard, is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "yes, you should try it.",
  "that sounds like a great idea!",
  "i understand that feeling. i am also in college right now and i'd like to go back to school but have no time.",
  "i can understand that. it's always a good idea to let your parents know.",
  "it sounds like you're feeling very sad right now.",
  "it sounds like you are working hard for yourself, and your doctor will be able to help you too. i am sure that you have a great doctor who can offer you some useful advice and support.",
  "it is great to talk to you! i'm glad you are feeling better!",
  "i am in my 30s so i know how you feel.",
  "what did you say when they stopped talking to you?",
  "i am currently working at the office and have been wanting to do some online work.",
  "no problem! i am glad to have been able to help.",
  "i hope you have a great day and i wish you all the best!",
  "it sounds like you're really feeling guilty about this. have you had an affair with your girlfriend?",
  "that is great to hear. i'm sure you will be able to make it through this.",
  "have you tried to get some sleep? try taking a few deep breaths before you go to bed and try to relax as much as possible before you get up.",
  "oh, i am sorry to hear that. i would say you need to get out of the house and get a new hobby.",
  "just do what you can to get yourself out there. you can do it, and it's good for you.",
  "what do you think?",
  "absolutely! i hope you have a great rest of your day.",
  "great! i've been trying to make some friends as well. i also have 2 brothers who are both at college. they are very supportive of me and have helped me.",
  "i can see why that would be a challenge. i would try to remember that you are not the only one who has to deal with that situation. it might be best to talk to your friends first, and let them know how you are feeling.",
  "yes you can do it with your friends and family",
  "that is a very difficult situation to be in. it sounds like you are in a good place though",
  "you're welcome, i am happy i could help.",
  "thats great! i wish you all the best and hope that things will get better for you : ) )",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i know it'll be hard to be around people who aren't social distandactive, but i'd be willing to bet you don'' t have a lot of friends who will be around to help you during this time.",
  "do you have a family?",
  "ok good",
  "i can understand where you are coming from, but it is important to stay calm and remember that they will always have feelings that you do not have.",
  "i know that there are a lot of issues at church, but there are always opportunities for local help.",
  "when i was in covid i was worried and kept thinking about the bad things going on and sometimes that helped me to deal with them.",
  "what do you mean by not having a home?",
  "so you feel like you need to get things done and do something about it?",
  "i can understand that, and i can relate to that feeling. i've been in a similar situation myself.",
  "i am glad i could help! i hope everything works out for you and your wife!",
  "yes, but there are videos on youtube, like from the app",
  "i think you should try it. i think it will help her.",
  "thank you for sharing! i think that's great that you've tried to stay positive about your situation. i'd love to have you read my book, diamond painting!",
  "you are so right. i would be worried about what people think about me. they think that i am lazy, that i have poor hygiene, and that i should be ashamed.",
  "well lets see, what are your plans today?",
  "wow.. i bet that is addicting..",
  "yes, that is a great idea",
  "i hope that you are able to find someone.",
  "oh that's great! i like to play videogames, as well.",
  "it is best to tell him that he has the right to be upset with you and your relationship with your ex.",
  "i understand that. have you tried talking to your boyfriend about it?",
  "i have been in a similar situation. i was married and living with my husband. we met at a church. we had a very hard time connecting with each other.",
  "i have a lot going on in my life that i really want to talk about. i feel that you have a healthy head on your shoulders. it sounds like you are on the right track to getting back on track and managing your family.",
  "i think it is a great idea to take some time off from school, and also take some rest during the semester.",
  "i know it can be difficult, but i'm glad i was able to be of help and i hope i could help you.",
  "that'd be a great first step!",
  "oh dear... so you feel that this person has abandoned you?",
  "that sounds very hard. i would suggest you speak to your parents.",
  "you too!",
  "i completely understand. i also know how hard it is to be in a relationship.",
  "have you thought about going to a different job?",
  "i think you should tell her that this has made you feel uncomfortable and perhaps she is being unhelpful to you. have you considered that maybe she may be taking advantage of your feelings?",
  "i am glad that i could help!",
  "you are very welcome.",
  "bye",
  "i hope you have a great day!",
  "i understand. it sounds to me like you have been drinking too often and that is making you feel stressed.",
  "it sounds as though you have realized that you have reached out to others and are seeking to improve on yourself. i believe that this will help you to get through this rough time.",
  "i think that would be a great way to convey that you are happy with the job.",
  "i'm sure they do, but it'll take some time to get used to it. you can try to put yourself in their shoes as you try to improve.",
  "i am glad i could help! sometimes we all feel angry, and it is a great way to help make a difference in a situation. i hope that you have a great rest of your day!",
  "i am happy that you are happy and i hope that your problems will get better.",
  "do you think that perhaps you could find a place to vent to your friends? you could even try writing in journal, and sharing your feelings with them.",
  "i know that is tough but you can do it",
  "i think you should definitely give it a try. i know that it's hard to lose patience but it'll be worth it. i think if you continue to be confident you'll get through this!",
  "no problem! you need to keep your head up and take care of yourself and your family.",
  "it sounds like you're very concerned about your relationship with your boss. maybe you should talk to your boss about the situation and let him know how you feel.",
  "that is too bad.",
  "i know it can feel intimidating, but you can also just start slowly looking for new friends and try to learn a new activity that will help you get through this.",
  "ok, so you are not having fun with your friend?",
  "i have had some really tough times too. it is hard.",
  "it sounds like your partner is doing a great job.",
  "i've been in the same position before. i was almost sick for a week, but the doctor took me home and i was back to normal.",
  "i think that is a great idea. i think it would help to learn about the different aspects of the world and what is causing the pandeification.",
  "you are very welcome. i wish you the very best of luck.",
  "i think that is a great idea",
  "what do you think is making her behave?",
  "i can definitely understand how stressful this can feel. do you have any friends or family that can help you out with the course?",
  "i can understand that, do you live alone?",
  "you are very welcome.",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "i know it'll be hard to get back into touch with your family members, but you're doing the right thing.",
  "so you are saying that it can cause depression?",
  "you are very welcome. i am glad i could be of some help. i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.",
  "have you tried talking to your friends about this?",
  "i try to make sure to take my dog out for a walk when i can. it is so much easier to get him out than it is to get to work!",
  "i am so glad that i was able to help you today!",
  "no problem. i hope things get better for you soon!",
  "you are welcome! have a wonderful day!",
  "that sounds like a good idea. it will help you relax and clear your mind.",
  "try to talk it out with her. if she is not understanding, maybe you can try to make her feel better about how you feel.",
  "you as well!",
  "it seems you have made the right choice and i think you will be a great partner.",
  "you too!",
  "it was very difficult for me. i had to go to my local counselling and take my mind off of it.",
  "you are very welcome. i am glad i was able to help.",
  "i understand completely, and i know how you feel. i myself have been in a similar situation, and it is definitely important to find ways to express your feelings in a positive way.",
  "i'd definitely go back there too! i think the weather is beautiful here right now, and there's some great food.",
  "i have, and i found that reading a book or doing yoga helped me too.",
  "i hope that they do, it's important to remember that you are also doing what makes you happy.",
  "i can see that you are frustrated with the friendship but i think that you need a better friend to talk about the issue and how you are feeling.",
  "i was in the same situation before i was married. it was helpful to talk to my spouse.",
  "that is an excellent way to spend your time and the one you love the most.",
  "that'll be a great start. i am sure you will get a job soon.",
  "i wish you the best of luck and i hope that you get a real job soon.",
  "i know how difficult that must be. it's hard but i'm sure that you will find the right person soon.",
  "thank you!",
  "yes, that is a great idea",
  "you're welcome. i hope it was helpful.",
  "you too!",
  "well if they dont care about your plans then maybe they dont want to hear your answer",
  "you should definitely do that! it is also great that you have someone to talk about this with. i bet you are really getting through this and that is a great idea!",
  "i hope that you are able to get this situation solved.",
  "i think you should be able to get them gifts. you could give them to them and see if they like it.",
  "i can understand how you feel. it's hard to talk about the past when you're in a position where you've been affected by this.",
  "i understand that, but if you bring it to mind, it might help to start with something small to be honest.",
  "you are very dedicated to your work and you can do it!",
  "i understand that completely. i can tell you are anxious about it.",
  "i understand that. it may be time to go to the gym for a new hobby",
  "you should try it out, it is a great relaxing music, i like to listen in the shower, i find that relaxing. you can find some good music on youtube.",
  "yes i'm sure it will be fine",
  "i hear you. i myself am also struggling with sleeping issues. i have found that even though i do have sleep issues, i have noticed that when i have a good night's sleep, i can relax more.",
  "have you tried any other ways of being self employed?",
  "do you have any friends who you could talk to about it?",
  "yes, i do recommend you do that as well.",
  "you are welcome. i wish you the best of luck with the rest of your life.",
  "have you thought of looking into a job search? perhaps your partner might be able to help you out.",
  "do you think it would be possible to get them back?",
  "yes, i see how that would be hard. i think that it might be worth talking to your professor about the situation. i also think that you could make a plan for when you will be able to graduate. perhaps even a day or two before you are ready to start your career.",
  "have a great rest of your day.",
  "you're welcome!",

  "have you tried contacting a local company or community group?",
  "do you think that you've been able to get through this without worrying about what other people think?",

  "have you ever considered doing something like that in order to get a little bit of time for yourself before you go to bed?",
  "i think that should help with the problem.",
  "your welcome. i hope you have a great night.",
  "it'll be okay. i think you will get through this!",
  "i think you should focus on the good things in your life. i think that this is a big step in the right direction for you.",

  "oh dear. that's a lot of work. i think you should consider a second job. maybe start with something you really enjoy.",
  "i used a lot of tools that made me feel better and i also tried to connect with people i knew and had a support system.",
  "we all want to be part of the community. and as we get older, we want to see the world in a better light.",
  "it sounds as though you are being too hard on yourself. i know it can be stressful. is there anything else you could do to make yourself feel better?",
  "you are so very welcome : ) have a good day!",
  "yes, i think that would be a great idea. i also love walking, i love being outdoors and being outside as well.",
  "oh wow that's so nice of you. is there anything else you would like to talk about?",
  "i am so sorry that you are facing this.",
  "do you think you can take some time to process this situation?",
  "you'll do it!",
  "it's not a surprise. i think it'll work out for you.",
  "have you tried to talk to your manager about this?",
  "i can understand that. i have been married 10 years and it'd definitely be a challenge to wake up for one woman. i would definitely feel that way too.",
  "i'm glad i could help!",
  "i'm glad i could help.",
  "have you tried talking to your boss about this issue?",
  "that's a lot of work! i'd be worried too, but i've been married for ten years!",
  "i can definitely understand how difficult that would be. i know it must be difficult to have such a difficult time getting through this.",
  "thats a great idea! i know that will help to get through this",
  "i see, i see. i'm sorry you feel that way. i think that you should try to find a way to connect with your cat.",
  "i'm glad you are feeling better now!",
  "if he does that then he will get banned from you",
  "you too!",
  "i think that you should be honest with him, that is a good thing, maybe he will understand,",
  "i am very sorry to hear that. i know it must be difficult for you to hear about this, but i can tell that you are doing all you can to keep in touch with your family. i hope that you will get through this!",
  "you are very welcome. have a great day.",
  "wow, that's a long time! do you think you would be able to get a new job if your boss was open to it?",
  "that is a bad situation. i would tell your friends that you really like them but that you guys are really close",
  "that sounds like a great idea!",
  "you should do some research on how to reduce the amount of hours you have to work, and see what your options are.",
  "i think that the government should not be concerned with the situation as long as it is legal.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that - i've had a similar situation with my partner.. we have been together for almost 15 years now and i'd love to say that we were close and now we have a good relationship, but i have been in a lot of situations where we have gotten into an argument over trivial things.",
  "i'm sure that will be helpful for you.",
  "that is very hard. i know you are feeling very strong though.",
  "well, i've had anxiety before and i found that it helps me to take care of myself and then take a day or two to relax and get my mind off things.",
  "i'm glad i could help. i hope i have been able to help you today!",
  "yeah, you can also try and write on the internet and earn money from people.",
  "that'd be a great start. i would definitely look into that.",
  "i am glad i could be of some help!",
  "you're welcome!",
  "i'm glad to hear that. i've been through a lot of difficult times with my children, but i'll take it you're feeling better now than before.",
  "i'm glad you've been able to talk to someone about this. i know it's difficult, but you can do it.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that.",
  "i understand.",
  "have you spoken to any of your co workers about this at all?",
  "i have, but i was not able to get into it.",
  "bye.",
  "i think we all have our own lives, but revenge is not the only option.",
  "are you afraid of your job?",
  "no problem, have a nice night!",
  "you too!",
  "that is understandable. it is hard to talk to people when you are in a stressful situation.",
  "i can see that you are feeling sad and want to be alone.",
  "you too!",
  "i am so sorry to here that.",
  "that sounds like a really difficult situation to be in.",
  "that'd be quite odd. perhaps you can ask your friend if they would like to come over and have some lunch?",
  "yeah that's true, it'll definitely help you to get your mind off things and then you can start to focus on other things that you can't control",
  "i think that your father is an amazing person and i wish you all the best.",
  "do you enjoy any other activities besides christmas?",
  "i would suggest taking a day at a time, and taking one hour at a week. you can get it done, and you can take it easy.",
  "you too! i hope it goes well for you! it'll definitely take some time, but you sound like a great person and i wish you all the best!",
  "well, i'm hoping the vaccine works out for you. there's no way to tell what will happen with the current vaccine.",
  "thanks!",
  "i know it is hard but i believe that it will get better.",
  "you too!",
  "have you tried any activities that could help you connect with other people? like exercise, reading, reading?",
  "it can be hard, but sometimes it is a good idea to reach out to people who can give you advice.",
  "yes, you should try to let the pandemics go.",
  "i think that is the right thing to do, it might be good for both of you to try and see what works for you.",
  "i hope that you do not feel that you have lost your self worth.",
  "i think you are both very strong and will be able to make the difference in this situation.",
  "i think you should just let her know you are upset and that you feel it might be a good idea to move on from this situation.",
  "try to get your mind off the stressful situation and focus on your breathing. i have had this happen to me a few times.",
  "i hope i have been able to help and help you in the least.",
  "i am so sorry to here that. i have been through that too. i felt so alone. i was in a bad place for a long time. i think it has to do with your depression and the way you are feeling.",
  "that sounds like a great place to meet new people. i know how hard it is to connect and not get connected with someone you really love.",
  "i understand! i also got mine fixed recently so i can relate.",
  "i see. i have been in a similar situation. i had to cut out some friends and i was upset with them too. i found that it was best to let them know that i was feeling this way and to try to work through the anger and let them learn from me. i also let them find out that i really do care about their feelings and that they are doing the right thing and that if they didn't want to help them then they should have gone to school or something to help themselves.",
  "have you tried to talk to your parents about this?",
  "i can tell you are really hard on yourself. i know it's hard to get through this but you are doing your best to get this through. i am proud of you and i think you can do it!",
  "i think that would be a great idea.",
  "i have a lot going on right now, but i have to do what i can to help you, because i have had a lot to go through, and i know that you will get through this.",

  "there is no need to change anything if you are not sure what type of job you want.",
  "have you considered moving to a new place?",
  "i am glad i have been able to help you today",
  "no problem. i hope you feel better soon.",
  "i am glad to hear that!",
  "it's so much easier when you just do it and don't worry too much about the exams.",
  "it is important to stay positive and keep looking for new opportunities.",
  "thank you!",
  "do you feel like you've done anything wrong?",
  "yes you should tell her that.",
  "i am glad i could help you today!",
  "i think you should look into local unemployment.. there are companies who will pay you based on your hours.. you can even get some sort of benefits.. if you have a good job you can get it paid less.",
  "you are so welcome. i wish you all the best.",
  "that sounds like a really hard situation. is there anyone at your doctor that can help him with his medication?",
  "have a good day",
  "try to do everything at once.",
  "i am sorry that you were crying.",
  "that is a great thing to be feeling guilty about. it is a good thing to know that you are doing your best.",

  "writing a note would be a great place to start for a paper.",
  "i wish you all the best!",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. i can tell that it's a very difficult situation.",
  "that'll make things very difficult for you.",
  "i think that might be a good way to approach it. i think you could get a chance to talk to your coworkers about it, and if they think you'll be a great fit, you can do it. maybe you could ask him if he's available to work with.",
  "it is true that you have to be there for him and you need to stay positive. it's important to know what is best for you and that you are there for each other.",
  "oh, that is very bad. i would be furious too.",
  "it sounds as though you are struggling to stay connected to your family and friends. is that correct? it seems as though this is the case for you as well.",
  "there are lots of restaurants near me that are open. there are a few in my city.",
  "oh, so you're afraid of everything going south.",
  "have a great holiday and be proud of yourself",
  "that's understandable. i can see why it is difficult for you to press the quit button.",
  "i've also been in a similar situation and i'd say that i'll be happy to share my experience with you. i'v had some very bad situations in my life too, and it'd be great to share your experience with others.",
  "you can do it! there are many companies out there that are hiring",
  "i understand your frustration. i am going through the same thing. i feel like i have to do my best to stay positive in order to get through this.",
  "bye!!",
  "i know it's hard to say that, but i know how you feel.",
  "i don't think she will do that, but i think you should talk to her first",
  "do you play any sports? i've done that a few times myself.",
  "that'll help you to be more supportive of your friends. i'd definitely talk to your friends about how you feel and maybe you could find a solution to the situation.",
  "have you tried to go out for a walk or walk? maybe it would help you a lot to get out of the house and see some friends.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i know it can be really difficult but at the same time you can do it.",
  "i think you should be proud of yourself and take pride in your work and be proud that you are doing what you believe is right for you.",
  "no. i never had a similar one. i had to take the same class for 3 years. i ended up finishing it and never came back.",
  "i'm glad you are doing this. you have got this!",
  "you too",
  "of course. i hope you feel better soon.",
  "i've been in a similar situation myself, but i found that if you have some sort of positive attitude and keep trying to make new friends, people will come around!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have your friends talked to you about the situation?",
  "i know you can do it, i'm sure you will do it!",
  "i am glad i was able to be of assistance.",

  "you'll get it. it'll take some time. you'd definitely get a better grade if you put your head to it first.",
