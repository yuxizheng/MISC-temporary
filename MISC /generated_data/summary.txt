We learned a lot even in just a few short months. We set goals, achieved them and then years passed and went again.  EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] That's too bad that he won't go again.

EOS 1 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah, I mean it's never easy going through a breakup, but people change as they get older and mature, and they aren't necessarily going to still be compatible the whole time.

EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thanks, I hope the same for you.  EOS 0 0 11 I go out pretty much only when I have a purpose and personal admin/errands. I work about one or two days a week out of my home. So with the rising cases, I just feel anxious having to get out of the safety of my home. I was a lot more anxious earlier this year though. I am much more used to it at this time.  EOS 0 0 12 And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after March. My life has been on hold and I am just surprised that it's even november now, because it feels like I am still stuck in March.  EOS 0 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yeah, that makes sense. When this was all new, the uncertainty probably made for more anxiety. Now that we know some more about what is safe and what isn't, maybe less so. But it doesn't mean the anxiety is gone, of course.

[contxt]	0 0 11 Sorry to hear that.  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Time heals all wounds. While that doesn't sound helpful now it is true. I also found focusing on the good experiences I had with my father (or in this case your best friend) helps. Remembering the times where you both were happy.  EOS 0 0 13 I will try to do that. How can I handle this sleepless nights?  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That's a tough one. I personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons. Some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed. I have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines. The biggest thing is to not use your bedroom for anything but sleeping; so don't read a book or play on your phone in bed, you have to train your body that when you go to bed it is time to sleep.  EOS 0 0 15 Sounds like stuff I can try out.  EOS 0 0 16 I have a strong attachment to my phone. Will be a tough one to try leaving it off while I try to get some sleep.  EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] Having a bedtime routine is also another tip. Try to do the same thing every night before bed.

EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. I have struggled to deal with depression most of my life, so I know it can be debilitating, but I have found ways to help myself.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Is there a specific problem making you depressed, or life in general?  EOS 3 0 7 I'd love to hear them. There is one problem in general i'm having that i seem to have always had because of the Depression. I have an extremely difficult time falling asleep.. and whenever I do manage to fall asleep.. i wake up always feeling like crap. I never feel rested no matter how long i sleep.  EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I have had trouble sleeping in the past and sometimes I still do, usually if it is when I'm nervous about the future.  EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] The number one way I have had to help my depression is to pray and read scripture. I don't know if you are a Christian, but that has helped me a lot. The second way is to have a good friend who will listen, not someone who will TELL me what to do or judge me, but someone who can empathize with me. A good listener is worth her weight in gold.  EOS 3 0 10 I've learned that mines not really an emotional thing. I feel like my sleeping issue causes my depression. Because no matter what- i always feel exhausted. Nothing has helped it besides medication. It just sucks always feeling fatigued and energyless. I actually did take up religion here this year to help with the coping that comes with this. It was very helpful for a while there  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If I didn't get good rest, then I would definitely feel tired the next day and over time, it would wear me out.

Tell me more about this?  EOS 3 0 8 I teach special needs students, and they definitely make me happy. It's a very, very rewarding job. However, with political division and COVID, it's hard to reach this population. Parents are not supportive. I feel like I'm being stretched so thin.  EOS 3 0 9 I'm also a parent, and my son is doing virtual learning, so he's just as isolated.  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I remember a time where learning crisis management that taking a deep breath and meditating in the positive work that you are doing can open up your mind to suggestions from your inner self. Have you ever thought that you superb skills can transmit in your home as well?  EOS 3 0 11 Getting to that mindsight is challenging when the overwhelming feelings of 'failure' loom so heavily. I was seeing a therapist and making great strides, then he informed me that he was moving to a private practice. I cannot afford his sliding scale, and I feel let down.

Most of the time I see myself as a positive person that can work through challenging situations, but like you said it's a tough time for everyone  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So now that you understand that you have a awesome skill and that is being positive, build on this.

EOS 0 0 5 It's a lot that is on my plate on top of the other things that I'm responsible for.  EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Alot of parents are experiencing the same difficulty, even I am experiencing trouble with my child. It is a lot of alien stress to us when, in the past, we were only responsible for ensuring that homework is done.  EOS 0 0 7 I agree with you there. It would be nice if they could be in school, but I understand that they shouldn't be.  EOS 0 0 8 I'd like more help and understanding from my husband, but he seems to be incapable of that.

EOS 1 0 4 My friend created a group chat for planning activities and did not include me. She included people who are closer to me than to her. Almost like she is trying to steal my friends.  EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. So when she did this, it gave you the feeling of almost being replaced or abandoned by your own social circle?  EOS 1 0 6 In a way. I was disappointed by the rest of them but mostly angry at her. It almost feels like she wants to be the leader of the group and feels like I am her competition.  EOS 1 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It's definitely frustrating to feel that your support system could possibly become a source of stress and competition anxiety. Especially since it's where we're supposed to feel safe and unjudged.  EOS 1 0 8 Exactly. They are supposed to be the people I can go to with my problems. Now I feel like they all had a secret which I wasn't privy to and it made me feel disconnected and untrusting towards them.  EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds that you're a person who really does care about keeping the relationships they've invested in healthy and open. That care level can definitely cause natural anxiousness in situations like this, when the place you stand with them and what they're thinking suddenly feels uncertain.

EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Ah I hear you - I think that there is a lot of that going around during this pandemic. Did you ever have a problem before?  EOS 3 0 3 No, this all actually started about 3-6 months after the pandemic really hit and things shut down.  EOS 3 1 4 [Others] It has been horrendous hasn't it? Have you been able to at least speak to your doctor, even if you could not see them in person?  EOS 3 0 5 Yes! So horrible! And yeah, I have a therapist I see once every two weeks. Although that only helps so much.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] It might be time to get some more help? Do you think it is bad enough that you might need inpatient treatment?  EOS 3 0 7 No, I'm not quite that bad off. It's sort of a mix of too many rough things. My wife and I are separating right now, I'm in the middle of a PhD program and living far from home, and covid really made it more challenging. I think it's a bit more circumstantial.  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] It sounds like you have had a really hard time the last eighteen months.

Can you think of anything else that would help you to keep your mind off everything going on?

EOS 4 0 4 He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia.  EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough, both for you and him.

[reference_response]	[Self-disclosure] I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy. In fact, it's confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on
[hypothesis_response]	[Providing Suggestions] sometimes just trying to think of things that you can do to help yourself out of your sadness is a good thing. i think it helps to think about what you really want to do and that's something that'll help you get out of the dark, not just for the sake of your own happiness. i mean, you already mentioned that you're struggling with depression and it'd be nice to have some time to think things through, but maybe you could find some time for yourself to think positively. i really don't know, it'll take time to process the pain and emotions, but we've come to learn that we're all living in this together and that we need to be able to try to move forward to help each others. i just try to try and enjoy things and not think about each other than we's the things. i's like we'cause we can's we't really, but not be ourselves, but it

[contxt]	3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] That sounds like a great start. Self care is vitally important in this difficulty time with COVID and the pandemic. I recommend any little bit of time that you can contribute to yourself, this includes reading, relaxing, meditating, exercise, or just resting. Anything that can help you repair so you are better prepared to help your grandson.  EOS 3 0 11 I will try my best to get more time for myself and try to relax more often that I currently am.  EOS 3 0 12 I am also trying to accept that my medical issues are getting worse and I can not do all that I use to, and that truly frustrates me as well.  EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Do you think the anger you are feeling is directly a result of the situation? Do you feel the anger is manifested from somewhere else? I think it is important to get to the underlying source of the anger and take care of that first and foremost.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That's concerning, but very understandable. Are you able to financially seek additional help? Sometimes it's just what you need, as hard or embarrassing as that may seem. No one needs to know what you seek, but it is important not to disregard additional help, be it mental health, physical therapy, or just general prevention and detection from a PCP.  EOS 3 0 15 I feel that I am having trouble dealing with the fact that I am not able to do all the things I want to do. It is not an easy thing to lose your abilities when you feel so young but your body says otherwise.  EOS 3 0 16 I was in physical therapy but could not afford it any longer. So instead I purchased my own hot tub to be able to soak in and do some water exercises that may help me.  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] I think that's a normal way to feel and a frustrating part of growing older. I think focusing on positives and things you enjoy will help keep your mind away from thinking about "what used to be" or "what once was" - finding passions and joys in new things could help revitalize you. Can I help you find new hobbies or passions?

I'm just fearful that if I try something new I won't be able to support myself financially, do you know what I mean?  EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] For sure.

I think I want to try something new and you have helped me realise this. I don't think I actually want to be happier in my current position. The question is how should I approach it?

EOS 3 0 82 yes I think those are mostly big goals that's why I don't know where to start  EOS 3 1 83 [Providing Suggestions] Weight loss is quantitative. Pick a number.  EOS 3 0 84 pick a number?  EOS 3 1 85 [Information] How much weight do you want to lose? How much can you lose this week, this month? It doesn't have to be much, but it must be measurable. How much less do you want to eat? It doesn't have to be much but it must be measurable. How much do you want to exercise? It doesn't have to be much but it must be measurable.  EOS 3 0 86 that's really good advice to break down that goal  EOS 3 1 87 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Great! I'm glad I was able to help.

[contxt]	0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] For me, when I start getting overwhelmed and need to "debrief" my mind, and "declutter" the stresses, I use a notepad. I jot down every detail I can that pops into mind. Every upcoming task, everything that has caused anxiety or similar, and then I prioritize them in an agenda. It seems tedious, however once you get a handle on scheduling, in my personal ex perience, it is easier to hold yourself accountable and slowly work your way through accomplishments, even small tasks, which is encouraging to continue.  EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Sometimes, something as small as an accomplished task can uplift a mood greatly. Especially when listed and checked off to see the progress.  EOS 0 0 9 Thank you. That seems helpful. I tend to make excuses for myself when I feel like this and allow myself to slip in other areas of my life. For example if I am stressed, I tend to eat unhealthy food. Overall its hard to juggle all things I want to do and be at once. I will plan to make a list and check off some small things.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] When you visually see your success, I hope it will help like it does for myself. I personally believe that it is a useful tool, depression runs deep and anxiety pushes it over the edge with deadlines. Life and Personal are very complicated situations. As is living, in itself. Small accomplishments, maybe with minor rewards to yourself as you go, boosts confidence and tends to fade out the overwhelming heavy feelings.  EOS 0 0 11 What do you consider to be a minor reward that would be a good tool for me today?  EOS 0 0 12 I have created a list and was able to check one thing off already. This has helped some and I feel a little more relieved.  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] A punch card. If you have one handy, a note card/index card. Draw maybe, 15 circles around the edge, and call it "My rewards" In the middle, choose one thing you enjoy, for instance, if you like an ice cream sundae, put that in the middle. For your first task, just jot all that is on your mind down, and also use that as the first task to yourself. Check off one circle, and once you hit 15 get that sundae!  EOS 0 1 14 [Others] Awesome! I am happy to hear that it has already helped a little! 
[reference_response]	[Others] Awesome! I am happy to hear that it has already helped a little!
[hypothesis_response]	[Others] that sounds great. i wish you the best of luck, and i'm sure you will find that small accomplishments are a blessing in disguise. i think that the fact that you are doing this at all means you are at least getting some relief from your anxiety and depression, which will help you get to know yourself and not worry so much about how you are feeling.

EOS 4 0 23 I was thinking about reading self help books or journaling but I was so down on myself.  EOS 4 1 24 [Information] Reading and journaling are also great tools to use.

I however am devastated that the whole relationship wound up a lie and the whole thing has me really in a bad place mentally.  EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I felt the same way when I broke up with my friend for some pathetic things which she did. The good part is girls are safe now. Give some time to yourself.

[contxt]	1 0 5 Yes it is and then she began avoiding me while we were in the same house, so we started arguing again and I found out she's been lying to me since I've known her and I'm very upset.  EOS 1 1 6 [Self-disclosure] That's definitely very upsetting. I know how it feels to have that sense of betrayal from a friend I was close to for many years. However, I was able to discuss the issue I had with my parents and other friends. Do you have anyone else close to you that you can talk to?  EOS 1 0 7 I don't think so, my parents think I was too harsh by deciding to end the friendship, it as if my own family doesn't understand.  EOS 1 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] That can definitely add to frustration. What about your other friends? Do you have anyone who either shares the same opinion as you or does not know your friend that you can talk to?  EOS 1 0 9 My other friend believed that it wasn't too harsh to end the friendship as they know I value honesty but it makes me feel angry that I was being used for so long and constantly lied to.  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] You have every right to be angry, but the most important thing you can do is find a good support system with your other friend. It will take some time to heal, but I'll tell you a paraphrased version of one of my favorite quotes: "Resentment is like swallowing poison and expecting the other person to die." It's important to find support in your other friends and heal properly.  EOS 1 0 11 I really love that quote, it's absolutely true; I think I will talk to my friend about the situation some more so I can fully get over it.  EOS 1 1 12 [Others] That sounds like a wonderful idea. Is there anything else you would like to discuss? 
[reference_response]	[Others] That sounds like a wonderful idea. Is there anything else you would like to discuss?
[hypothesis_response]	[Others] i'd definitely recommend that. it sounds like you have a good handle on this and i know you can heal through this friendship, but you're also going to heal through your friendship through healing, and you'll be able to make new friends who appreciate you as well.

[contxt]	1 0 25 So do you think I should try and talk to her and ask her outright if she has met someone else?  EOS 1 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] I think rather than ask her that question directly, you could start the conversation and ask her why she is feeling this way. This would show you care and are prepared to listen without jumping to conclusions.  EOS 1 0 27 I think I do need to calm down a bit and maybe talking to her would be the best way to start. I don;t know what I'd do though if she ended it.  EOS 1 1 28 [Providing Suggestions] The best thing to do would be prepared to have the conversation, stay calm and listen.

EOS 1 1 30 [Information] Be prepared that she may end the relationship but getting angry is likely not to change her mind. Getting angry does not improve difficult conversations.  EOS 1 0 31 I suppose I could go into it and listen as you have said, there could be other reasons like the new job or maybe morning in that is causing some of it. I'll try and keep calm but it is hard when emotions run high.  EOS 1 1 32 [Providing Suggestions] Take a deep breath and try to relax beforehand.

EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I like going to the gym alone but that's just my personal preference. There are fitness groups like bootcamps that you could join and meet new people. Who knows, you may meet a new friend.  EOS 3 0 13 That is a good idea. I need to be around other people who have goals like weight loss. My boyfriend never wanted me to join groups and only wanted me to be friends with his family. That is why I am so alone right now. I made bad choices.  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds hard. You deserve to have friends of your own.  EOS 3 0 15 I agree with you. Do you think that I should try calling his friends and asking for his new number?  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] there are lots of different kinds of groups you can join, not just fitness. and you can choose how much you want to actively engage with them. I would suggest taking time for yourself. Maybe give yourself some distance from him. If you both decide to reach out again in the future that may be an opportunity, but definitely take care of you.  EOS 3 0 17 Yeah, I can see your point of view. I have been obsessed with our relationship. We had a fight and it was a verbal war between us and he wouldn't forgive me afterwards.

When I was in school same thing happened with mw. They know us very well I realized now. Try to talk to them everyday for a while. It might work.  EOS 0 0 12 Maybe you're right!

EOS 0 1 3 [Question] okay, that is valid, do you have an idea what is causing the confusion?  EOS 0 0 4 So I've been dating and my parents are aware. But recently after I said I want to go on a trip with my boyfriend, my parents have all sorts of opinions about it. And all their traditional beliefs that I did not know existed are now on the surface and they are kinda forcing me to follow it.  EOS 0 0 5 For say they think "bad types of woman" go on trips with their boyfriends and I need to save myself.  EOS 0 0 6 They have been guilt tripping me and I feel very confused.  EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your feelings are valid and it is okay to feel confused in this situation considering you love your boyfriend and parents 
[reference_response]	[Affirmation and Reassurance] Your feelings are valid and it is okay to feel confused in this situation considering you love your boyfriend and parents

EOS 3 0 14 2 years  EOS 3 1 15 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating.  EOS 3 0 16 What do you mean exactly?  EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it.  EOS 3 0 18 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily.  EOS 3 1 19 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations.

[contxt]	5 0 10 The kids are pretty smart, they found out and was mad at first, but now they are accepting, which is making me even more disgusted. I have even started to resent my kids for it.  EOS 5 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I think it would help to sit down and have a conversation with them about it. It is important that they know how you feel and that you are there for them, and that they aren't the reason for the issues.  EOS 5 0 12 I did at least sit down with the kids about it, told t hem how I felt, explained the nature of the situation. But they weren't on my side, they acted like they were on my side at first but then switched up on me, made me feel like I was the one wrong!?!  EOS 5 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about seeking a group of people who have been through this same situation that you are going through now? It often helps to talk to people who have been through the same things and get their help to get through the situation.  EOS 5 0 14 Apparently that's you smh lol.. How did you feel? What did you do?  EOS 5 1 15 [Self-disclosure] This is true I suppose. I made sure to have a conversation with her first in order to get some closure on the situation. After that I focused on more of my hobbies that I hadn't been able to do in a while in order to keep my mind distracted and off of the situation.  EOS 5 0 16 I'm still not ready to have that conversation with him. He's acting like I made him cheat on me. Maybe I should find some hobbies to distract myself until I can myself to that point.  EOS 5 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I think that would definitely help! 
[reference_response]	[Self-disclosure] I think that would definitely help!
[hypothesis_response]	[Providing Suggestions] i think that that is a good idea. it may be difficult to get back into your head but i think you are doing the right thing. maybe you should talk to your husband about how you are feeling. sometimes talking to someone else will help you feel more connected to the situation and make you feel better.

EOS 2 0 10 I can try, but I don't see how it will help me to find a job. I barely can sleep at nights  EOS 2 1 11 [Information] Getting a lot of rest or releasing stress will improve your fear and anxiety, which will lead to a more positive attitude to finding a job. Having a more postiive attuide well help you find a job.  EOS 2 0 12 Do you think interviewers see that I have a fear and anxiety and that's why I don't get a job?  EOS 2 1 13 [Others] Of course they do. They can sense those emotions and take that into consideration when they are interviewing you.  EOS 2 0 14 Oh ok I will try yoga then.

So I called here  EOS 0 0 31 Are you or your daughter in therapy?  EOS 0 1 32 [Self-disclosure] I'm a great mother and I always put my daughter's feelings first. She made the decision not to see or speak to her father. Him and my now ex-best friend are on drugs and don't have custody of their own children. It's in my daughter's best interest that she doesn't know him.  EOS 0 1 33 [Self-disclosure] Yes, we are both in therapy. It helps immensely.  EOS 0 1 34 [Providing Suggestions] I know that you weren't the one who cheated, but I would still highly recommend talking to someone about what happened. This is going to be very hard to get through. Again, I am incredibly sorry that you are going through all of this. Our chat session will only last for a total of about 30 minutes. This is meant to be a one-time task, unfortunately.  EOS 0 0 35 I'm not sure if you can help me because I've never did drugs.  EOS 0 1 36 [Self-disclosure] I never did drugs either.

EOS 0 1 25 [Others] Oh for my situation it was 100% my fault i was in a bad place during that time. I spent my time couch surfing til my friends got tired of me. Bounced around shelters after i sold my car. Washing up and brushing my teeth were the least of my problems.  EOS 0 1 26 [Information] May i ask what state you are in?  EOS 0 0 27 I rather not say.

EOS 7 0 7 No, because time management I feel is something that I have to resolve on my own, and I have enough courses on my plate right now.  EOS 7 0 8 But I guess for time management, I tend to be distracted easily or spend too long on other stuff outside of my studies  EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh ok I see. I have actually been in this type of situation before, and I took those classes and they actually helped.  EOS 7 0 10 I see. So would you be able to share some tips on time management?  EOS 7 1 11 [Others] Yes sure I can . 
[reference_response]	[Others] Yes sure I can .

I like the idea of using supplements and seeing how they work for me before moving onto heavier antidepressants.  EOS 3 0 30 That's true, I'm just hoping the end of the tunnel isn't too far away. Can't face another summer locked inside with nothing to do!  EOS 3 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sounds good! Enjoy your coffee and the rest of your day! :)  EOS 3 0 32 Thanks, I will do.

EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I had this same problem in school and as I grew up I learned how to speak up and defend myself when people were rude and mean to me.

[contxt]	2 0 20 Yes that's true. I believe he might understand me and accept my request. Would be quite challenging if we will meet my ex wth other friends in same pub. I live in a small town.  EOS 2 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] oh I see, yes that could be awkward for sure.  EOS 2 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] i think it's important you go out with your friend, but can understand your reluctance to run into your ex. Could you go out for coffee or lunch instead?  EOS 2 0 23 Well that's would be quite strange as we usually meet only for drinks.  EOS 2 1 24 [Question] Ah gotcha. So do you think you will accept or not? Or still need time to think about it?  EOS 2 0 25 I will give it a go and see what happens. I will text you tomorrow to let you know how it went  EOS 2 1 26 [Providing Suggestions] i hope if you go that you have an enjoyable time, and that your friend respects your boundaries. And worse case scenario, if your ex is there, you could leave early...if it were me I'd warn my friend that I might have to  EOS 2 1 27 [Others] I'm glad you are going!

[reference_response]	[Others] I'm glad you are going! Take care of yourself and have a good time. Was there anything else?
[hypothesis_response]	[Providing Suggestions] if you're planning on going out with friends, i think you could make a plan for yourself if you decide to go out on your own, and if you feel that you've done enough to make it worth it, you can tell your friend that you are prepared for that, and you'll want to be prepared for the challenge that comes with it. i think that is a big step of getting to know your friends better.

EOS 2 1 19 [Question] It would be a really good place to start. Then you could be really kind to yourself and take some pressure off. Would you like to talk through some ideas to help with the work itself?  EOS 2 0 20 Yes I really would. I already feel more motivated! Half an hour ago I felt that I had no place left to go and felt defeated.  EOS 2 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] That's really good, sometimes it is about finding a direction and small steps. Often when we are studying the work seems really big, especially essay questions. One thing that helped me was to break it into really small chunks, sometimes physically covering up some of the question. Would that be something that would help?  EOS 2 0 22 I have not really tried it but I ought to. I often feel that I am just overwhelmed. Then I know that I got something wrong for definite and I just want to give up.  EOS 2 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] It could be something you can try, remember , it is not always about ought to, simply how can I make it easier for myself. It is okay to get things wrong too. If you decide to write your list of reasons why you love microbiology, maybe you could keep it in a place you see every day, a mirror or fridge and keep seeing where you are trying to get to.

[contxt]	4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay  EOS 4 0 6 She had a desire to do marine biology and I wanted to pursue law enforcement as a police officer, however due to my back injury that fell through recently. She would spend most of her time doing field work, which would require her to spend time out at sea. She was working in a nursing home at the time and was not a marine biologist.  EOS 4 1 7 [Information] She did not like your career path?  EOS 4 0 8 I am thinking that would be the case, however we dated for 3 years and then reconnecting about a year later which at this time was a distant relationship. She now has a boyfriend which she started date about 2 months she broke up with me. I found out that he works with her at the nursing home. I am unsure what to think, but she did say that she just didn't see how our career paths would work out and that was that.  EOS 4 1 9 [Others] If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after  EOS 4 0 11 I have had some friends echo that. I agree, it definitely felt like I was giving a lot through the time we dated. I have always wondered if this was a true statement, knowing her I think she probably got scared of what that entailed or just the distance. The new boyfriend was definitely a wild card, that I think has caused me to question her parting words  EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don't support your career 
[reference_response]	[Affirmation and Reassurance] Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don't support your career

In a rut for sure.  EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I am glad that you are expressing yourslef today and facing your feelings. This could be a start to changing somethings in your life. It isn't usually easy talking about being in a rut.  EOS 3 0 14 It is very tough to express feelings.  EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I would like to suggest starting a journal to write down just the bullet points of how you feel at the end of each day. Would you consider trying this activity?

Ask her if there is anything she might want to discuss. She maybe having issues shes afraid to talk about.  EOS 3 0 14 I think you hit upon something. She is quite hesitant in talking about issues. Do you have any thoughts about marriage counselling? We've never tried that.  EOS 3 1 15 [Information] I think that would be a good idea. Having the chance to get things out and getting more advice is always helpful. Make sure you leave any issues at common ground.  EOS 3 0 16 If my wife is the one having issues with conversations, do you think a male or female therapist/counsellor would be better? I want her to feel comfortable expressing herself.  EOS 3 1 17 [Information] Most likely a female therapist would be better. Nobody understands a woman more than a woman.  EOS 3 0 18 I think that sounds like a safer choice. I was also hoping if you have suggestions for me personally. I am quite depressed and I am having problems getting through the day.  EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I suggest taking one step at a time. I wouldn't rush through things. I would suggest sitting down and talking through some things that are going on.

EOS 4 0 24 I believe it's because I felt useless after that point  EOS 4 1 25 [Reflection of feelings] That's interesting, so you feel that you were together so long as you could help her, but then you lost interest in her?

EOS 0 1 28 [Others] I am so incredibly sorry that you have to deal with all of this at all but especially at the start of the holiday season. My heart absolutely breaks for you.  EOS 0 1 29 [Self-disclosure] Yes, we have a daughter. He spent the first eight years of her life in prison. I gave her the choice as to whether or not she wanted to get to know him. He had plenty of opportunities to speak to her and chose not to call or show up when he was supposed to. The last thing she said about him was, "All he does is lie to me and break promises. I don't want to see him or talk to him anymore."  EOS 0 0 30 And no I haven't thought or going to therapy. I'm not the one who cheated on anyone and this just happened Friday.

It really doesn't have anything to do with you.  EOS 4 1 15 [Information] Sometimes low self worth makes a person seek that kind of exterior validation from someone else.  EOS 4 0 16 I should have followed and stalked her like this guy did, it seems to turn her on, she said she likes being watched. I told her to see a therapist and she told me to leave our apartmnent.  EOS 4 1 17 [Question] That doesn't sound healthy to you, does it?  EOS 4 0 18 Yes, I think she has low self esteem, but she let me do things with her, we would experiment sexually together, it was wild.

[contxt]	2 0 5 Yes, specially with the disastrous winter storm I underwent. Makes me nervous if our state decides to shut down to combat the pandemic. I am unsure as to what to do  EOS 2 0 6 I believe its more of a general sense of anxiety. I had to take a 25% pay cut with reduced hours, it was a complete lifestyle change. Not only for myself but for my children  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can definitely understand why that would be difficult. Dealing with uncertainty during the pandemic is extremely difficult, as there are so many unforeseen circumstances.  EOS 2 1 8 [Self-disclosure] One thing that helps me out in those moments, is to remember that there are things in the world and life that I can control, and others that I can't control.  EOS 2 0 9 Yes, I could not agree with you more. Specially now that I have tapped into my savings and retirement. Never in life did I think I would worry about paying my light bill.  EOS 2 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It seems like the best thing you can do at the moment is try your best to do the best you can at your job. If there will be paycuts, you might not be able to prevent it. But at least you will know that you gave a valiant effort.  EOS 2 0 11 Thank you for the kind words. I have control of some aspects.

The bad thing is societal pressure demands that we be productive or we think we're wasting time. When's the last time you took a day to enjoy something you like to do?

You are dealing with the care and growth of the most complex organism on this planet...times two! That's incredible. First of all, give yourself a pat on the back for that.

She is my mom's only sister and the only relative I have left from that generation and I love spending time with her. That was a good suggestion and I'll try to look forward to that.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, trips are amazing and especially when you visit someone you love spending time with makes even more worthwhile. Time that you get to spend with enjoying yourself and relaxing is something that needs to happen often so we can get back in the fight to be confident or strong to face our daily challenges.

EOS 1 1 3 [Question] So you are having issues with your friend? That is upsetting . What is the issue?  EOS 1 0 4 She has been having a problem with a different friend for years. I have been listening to these problems for all of that time. And even though it's so frustrating, because it's the same problem over and over again, I keep listening because she's my friend. But lately I have been going through a lot, and I haven't had as much time to sit and listen to these same problems, and she gets so angry telling me I don't care about her. The problems I've been going through are very serious, and I just don't have time to sit on the phone listening to the same stuff I've been dealing with for years.  EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand how angry unappreciated and burnt out you must be feeling. I would feel that way too  EOS 1 0 6 It's been really rough. I've tried so hard to be there for her, and I feel like she just doesn't even appreciate it.

I have never gotten into trouble before with my friends  EOS 1 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] My suggestion is that tell her these facts and she can make a better decision.

EOS 3 0 9 The child is with us every other week and maybe that is why he treats him differently but my husband knows that it is causing problems in our relationship and refuses to change those behaviors. I just do not know what to do anymore.  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Is there someone that's close to both of you that you could talk to, that way they can help him see that it's very apparent that he's treating him different?  EOS 3 0 11 I suppose I could talk to his mother. But, I have reservations because I feel like she will side with him since it his her son.  EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Very true, and it would likely be better with someone no quite so close to the situation. But you also don't have to attack him to her, just lay out the facts. I understand the frustration, it's hard to see your kids hurting or feeling like they're not enough. Is this the biggest issue you guys are dealing with in your marriage?  EOS 3 1 13 [Others] Or is it just another thing you're not getting along on?  EOS 3 0 14 That is very true. This is our main issue.

Are there any clubs or groups associated with your major? That way, you have some common ground to work with.

EOS 7 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] That sounds like a good idea =) Even if you can't hold club meetings on campus or have any gatherings, maybe they hold their meetings over video calls. One plus side to that, is that you don't need to have your camera on to participate.  EOS 7 0 14 That's true. I also feel a bit nervous about my final grades, I've done well so far but just feel like this year might mess everything up.

EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Are there situations or moments that specifically make you feel like this is going to happen? Or are you just feeling a general sense of anxiety and fear it might happen?  EOS 2 0 5 Yes, specially with the disastrous winter storm I underwent. Makes me nervous if our state decides to shut down to combat the pandemic. I am unsure as to what to do  EOS 2 0 6 I believe its more of a general sense of anxiety. I had to take a 25% pay cut with reduced hours, it was a complete lifestyle change. Not only for myself but for my children  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can definitely understand why that would be difficult. Dealing with uncertainty during the pandemic is extremely difficult, as there are so many unforeseen circumstances.  EOS 2 1 8 [Self-disclosure] One thing that helps me out in those moments, is to remember that there are things in the world and life that I can control, and others that I can't control.

Is this a good thing or not a good thing? Or you aren't sure?  EOS 4 0 5 It's an expected thing but it's sad. We have hurt each other many times and he is a daily drug user and is very much a fair weather friend.  EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Ouch! That is a sad thing. As I was sitting here thinking about friends I have moved on from, sadly, most of the time it was for the best, even though it hurt at the time.  EOS 4 0 7 My friend stopped showing up when he said he would and I slowly stopped answering his calls and texts.  EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Life is a journey, and as we walk toward goals in our life, people either join us or bring us down. Sometimes they only walk on the path we are on for a short time, sometimes longer. I have very few friends from High School, 2 to be exact. And only on FB, that was back in 1979 too. lol I'm old, but I have had to move on from destructive relationships, as you are doing now. It can be hard.  EOS 4 0 9 This is so strange and wonderful connecting with a stranger about this! Wow. That's true. I kept trying to get my friends clean and to work on a hobby with me but drugs destroyed my two best friends and killed one of them.  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Ouch! That sounds hard. I had friends like that too. I had to walk away. Has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him? The reason I ask this is because it's good to get some closure and let them know their behavior is destructive and you need space from that.

[contxt]	3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I remember a time where learning crisis management that taking a deep breath and meditating in the positive work that you are doing can open up your mind to suggestions from your inner self. Have you ever thought that you superb skills can transmit in your home as well?  EOS 3 0 11 Getting to that mindsight is challenging when the overwhelming feelings of 'failure' loom so heavily. I was seeing a therapist and making great strides, then he informed me that he was moving to a private practice. I cannot afford his sliding scale, and I feel let down. It's just that when one thing starts to go wrong, other things follow. Most of the time I see myself as a positive person that can work through challenging situations, but like you said it's a tough time for everyone  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So now that you understand that you have a awesome skill and that is being positive, build on this. What building blocks can you write down that has helped you pushed through the fire and keep it some where close to you to always give you piece of mind and reinforce your habits of pushing through the fire.  EOS 3 0 13 Well, I am not one for journaling or anything. I try to stay active. I am about 6 months into remission from stage 4 HL (cancer) and it's been quite the emotional journey there. With that said, the mental and physical overhaul left quite a dent in my overall feelings about myself. I'm just now able to run again and in the past week I ran 2 5k's. To me, this was monumental and made me feel great. I'm also learning how to not overextend myself. I just keep hoping for continued improvement in all areas. The reinforcement is just that I can get through this, these feelings are only temporary.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] I totally understand that you are not for writing things down to keep. Yet, you have gone through a alot of events in your life where other would have given up. The key is transmitting your successes regardless of the situations. COVID is not going anywhere and as a person who has beaten stage 4 cancer, it is scary to be living in these times. You are doing monumental things, never forget that because your feelings and stamina for living will bind everything together. Politics, is the dirtiest and no government can solve and will solve the problems in the world.  EOS 3 0 15 thank you for listening. It helps to sometimes just get it out there.

[contxt]	4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love  EOS 4 0 18 That's exactly it. So do you think I should just talk to her and tell her how I feel? The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience.  EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just "kicking her to the curb." Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard  EOS 4 0 20 Yes, I think I need to emphasize the friends element of it and potentially support her to move on. I suppose I'm fearful that it will never end but I'll need to face into that and stay strong, and obviously avoid being intimate as this would really hurt her if I continued to sleep with her. I need to be careful about that I think!  EOS 4 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, I can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it. But I think you are going to be able to do that just fine!  EOS 4 0 22 I must say, you have been fantastic to talk to about this, we have had a similar experience so I think the advice is coming from experience. Thanks for that!  EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] What I've gathered about you as a person, makes me confident that you probably chose a partner that will be able to have this talk with you and you both will come to an understanding.  EOS 4 1 24 [Others] Yes I think it's very great we were able to connect on our issues! It definitely helps. You are welcome! :)

EOS 4 1 24 [Others] I think that perhaps you do not need this toxic person in your life. After fifteen years without him do you really feel you need to stay r reconciled?  EOS 4 0 25 I don't need him, no... But he's funny, and I don't have too many people in my life right now. I just moved to a new state where I literally know no one.  EOS 4 1 26 [Others] In that case perhaps you can just agree to disagree on this topic? If you don't want to risk the friendship :). I hope I have been able to be of some help to you today and thank you for talking!  EOS 4 0 27 And I'm also hurt and annoyed that he thinks I have anything to apologize for, when I put up with his acid tongued comments, and just turn the other cheek. I agree we should just go on, but I'm not going to apologize, when I didn't do anything.  EOS 4 0 28 Anyway - yes. I agree with you. Thanks for the talk. Take care!  EOS 4 1 29 [Others] And you too!

I have been feeling quite lonely too, I find myself feeling lonely at work and struggling to find someone I trust to talk to about these emotions. Do you have a friend or family member that you trust who might understand some of these feelings?  EOS 3 0 5 i do have a few friends that i think i can talk to about how i am feeling however the thought of them being too busy with their work is what prevents me from reaching out to them.  EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand. Correct me if i'm wrong, it sounds like you're nervous to open up to these trusted people because you think they might be distracted by their work to provide the empathy you need and fully understand how you are feeling. Does that sound right?  EOS 3 0 7 you know i think that you are right about this. it has always been difficult for me to open to others even with those that have been there for me when i needed someone. i feel like a mix of emotions nervous but at the same time wanting to reaching out for help  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] I understand these feelings very well. Sometimes, my fear overshadows my want for help. I find it easier to open up to others through writing rather than face to face. Have you considered putting your feelings in writing and opening up to trusted friends and family in this way?  EOS 3 0 9 i have been writing for a while but due to my emotions i have stopped writing like i used to. when i did write i did notice a change in my feelings it became more positive and less depressed. now that i stopped writing its like i went back into depression  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It sounds like writing your feelings down helped you greatly in the past.

EOS 1 0 13 I think he will be apologetic. He has always treated me fairly. It is difficult for me to put my anger aside sometimes, which is why I have not said anything yet. I am afraid I will not remain calm and might say something mean to him. That would be terrible.  EOS 1 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are nervous about saying something mean. What do you think would be helpful for you to do do in order to prepare? Some people in your situation might find it helpful to role-play with someone.  EOS 1 0 15 Yes! That is a wonderful suggestion! Maybe I can ask my sister to pretend to be my boss when I talk with her. I m  EOS 1 0 16 OOPS! I mean to say I'm sure she would be happy to help.  EOS 1 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] That sounds like a great idea! Then when you actually talk with your boss, it will be easier since you already talked about it with your sister.

[contxt]	3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You're absolutely right that sometimes there is a need for medication. My mother suffers from depression as do I. She has to take Effexor everyday for her condition. I, however went through COUNTLESS combinations and never found a relief as helpful as when I write and talk to people.  EOS 3 0 17 I also went through a lot of different combinations before ending on on Prozac. I think that different things work for different people. I do not find it very easy to talk to people.  EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Have you explored other theraputic avenues to synchronize with the medication?  EOS 3 0 19 No, I am rather way of 'natural' or homeopathic medicine. Are there any kinds that you could recommend?  EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You're doing VERY well talking to me! Had you not said anything, I would have assumed that to be the best choice! But if you're an introvert, then my first suggestion is to journal.  EOS 3 0 21 I do do a lot of that but I would feel too shy to show anyone my journal. Your help has been invaluable though and I do feel more receptive to other forms of treatment now.  EOS 3 1 22 [Question] That way you can reflect on what you've written and possibly learn patterns, triggers, moodswings and other information that would help the problem.

So that makes me anxious  EOS 0 1 7 [Information] Unfortunately, life doesnt always do what we want. What we can do is plan ahead though. It will make you less anxious if you know you have a back up plan.

[contxt]	0 0 5 No. This just happened last week so I am trying to keep all of the balls in the air. I was thinking about talking with them Wednesday this week. They are meeting on Thursday.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] That is a good idea. I would go over your resume and spruce it up before talking to them on Wednesday to add in anything pertinent that you might have learned or achieved during your time with the company these last two years. Make sure the day you approach them that you're well rested, clean and put together. Google some confidence stances and pay attention to your posture. Even if you're feeling nervous there are ways to hide it and appear confident.  EOS 0 0 7 Wow, that's really good advice. Thanks. I didn't think about updating my resume, and I really should have thought about it.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] No problem, I hope it helps.  EOS 0 0 9 Should I talk with my coworker about it? He does not want that job.  EOS 0 1 10 [Others] If you feel that he might be able to provide more advice then sure.  EOS 0 0 11 I just don't want him to think I am trying to weasle my way in.  EOS 0 1 12 [Information] If he isn't interested in the job himself I'm sure he wouldn't see it that way.

EOS 0 0 35 I am still anxious about the end of school  EOS 0 1 36 [Information] Not at all, I think what you are experiencing is completely normal, and you just have to cope with it in the most optimistic way possible. Maybe getting your assignments done in time will be helpful for your anxiety. After that, you will have tons of time to spend with friends, family, or simply leisure time to do what you enjoy.

What do you think a good first step would be?  EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] That's a good question. I would show support for her and empathize with her and her situation. Do you have lunch with her? Can you send her a text letting her know she's valued? She might appreciate that.  EOS 5 0 9 Sometimes we have lunch, but usually she just eats at her desk. I could easily send her texts of encouragement.  EOS 5 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Ok. That's a good first step. I think you have a way forward with this. Maybe after a few texts, you can sit down and talk about solutions in detail, like going to HR.  EOS 5 0 11 Ok. I'll try sending a couple of texts every day. Then I'll see if she wants to have lunch outside with me when the weather gets better.  EOS 5 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's a good positive step.

[contxt]	3 1 7 [Question] Well I had to sit down and think about why I was stuck and tried to come up with as many options as I could to be unstuck, then i put them in order based on which I thought would work best. It took quite a few of them, but I did finally get unstuck.  EOS 3 0 8 I can try doing that.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Every one is different, but it is worth a shot, might help the rut your having, might also give you new ideas that will help you decide on how to not feel like your in a rut anymore. Sometimes just talking to someone can help too, bouncing ideas off of each other can help in some cases.  EOS 3 0 10 True, I have been avoiding most people.  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Its hard to talk about certain problems, so I can't blame you, however you can get some good ideas from others. You might have just needed some space to evaluate your situation, nothing wrong with taking a break from things or people if it helps you.  EOS 3 0 12 I will try reaching out to my sister tomorrow. maybe she can help.  EOS 3 0 13 I also feel embarrassed that I feel so unhappy.  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] From chatting with you I can tell you might be ready to start talking and maybe get some help or advice, family is a great start they are typically a great support system. It is okay to feel embarrassed but being unhappy will eat at you, sometimes its good to set our pride aside so that we can figure things out. In my situation of feeling stuck I was ashamed that I sat and let people treat me so badly but it wasn't until I seen it as a problem that I started making my lists and getting advice. Some things we do on our own and some its good to have people to help. I think reaching out to your sister would be worth a try, she might also have different ideas and suggestions you haven' t thought of yet.

(I'm in Pennsylvania.)  EOS 3 1 47 [Self-disclosure] Thank you so much! We broke up several months ago and I'm already feeling and doing so much better. I am also much better off without that person in my life. I've gained weight back that I couldn't really afford to lose to begin with, I've been more motivated, etc. It really was for the best even though the breakup itself was really difficult.  EOS 3 1 48 [Others] I live in Pennsylvania as well! It's such a small world!  EOS 3 0 49 My breakup was a few months ago too. I'm in the Poconos. :)  EOS 3 1 50 [Others] I've always wanted to go to Las Vegas. My brother and his girlfriend just took a trip out there not too long ago.

[contxt]	3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] In times of great stress and upheaval, there is only so much you can do. The rest is worry, a hamster running in a wheel, a huge output of energy that does nothing at all.  EOS 3 0 8 Yeah that makes sense but I've spent so much time thinking about my finances that I've sort of burned myself out  EOS 3 0 9 Like I have no energy even to be thankful for the other little stuff  EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] That makes sense. You sound emotionally exhausted.  EOS 3 0 11 Definitely, I feel like I could sleep forever but with my kids to worry about I don't have that option  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Gratitude is one of those things, I've found, that is self-perpetuating. Even if you begin by doing it robotically, eventually your mind and heart will want to be more sincerely grateful. I have in the past challenged myself to find five things to be grateful for in the morning and write them down. Whether those things are "I have hot coffee and electricity" or "I won $1000 for free", they will begin to start a small fire of joy.  EOS 3 0 13 Messages could work, I could stick them around and I guess they coudl help not just me but my little ones too because I'm sure my moods been affecting them as well  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a great idea!

EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Is it possible to try to talk to him calmly and tell him exactly how he has made you feel?  EOS 1 0 11 Yes. I tried calmly of the situation. He told accepting as the situation has passed. I am not sure he has fully understood. As the situation passed, he says okay.  EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] I think you need to decide whether you just just let it go or whether you cant' and won't be able to continue the friendship  EOS 1 0 13 However I continue the friendship not affected by this harassment.

Maybe holiday music, movies, bright snow (if there is snow where you live), or seeing joy on someone's face when you give them a great gift?  EOS 3 0 12 They say it gets easier. And I agree it does. Things just have changed so much. I miss how life was before I lost them.  EOS 3 1 13 [Information] I understand - and it is normal to feel that way. When we lose someone who brought us happiness, it is only natural to miss them and their company.  EOS 3 0 14 I love giving gifts. And I always put lots of thought into the gifts I give.

(because of the quality of teaching)  EOS 3 0 14 I hope there was someone, but I don't think we have a counselor  EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] More reason to speak to a school counselor or school administrator.

At the moment I get up at around 11am but U have been trying to get up earlier but I just can't make myself do it. I've also been sleeping during the day which is maybe not good.  EOS 3 1 15 [Question] Have you tried reading? I find reading motivates me sometimes, too. Sometimes too much thinking alone leaves me digging a hole for myself.  EOS 3 0 16 I used to get a lot of pleasure from reading and would always have a book on the go. Now reading feels like a chore, as if I am making myself do it.  EOS 3 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I sometimes force myself to exercise when I get sleepy when I shouldn't be tired during the day.  EOS 3 0 18 That's a good idea I could definitely try that.

EOS 1 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I think sometimes it's easy to jump to anger when you feel hurt. It might be worth telling her how you feel and also maybe ask why she thinks you should be doing things her way. Maybe there's a give and take in this situation. Some of her methods could be beneficial.  EOS 1 0 9 Do you have any advice on how to start my conversation with her? I have found some of her ideas to be beneficial.

EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] Tell her the things that you like about her method and maybe suggest some of your methods to her as well. Maybe she'll find them to be more efficient. Make it a partnership rather than a fight for whose method is better.

[contxt]	3 0 15 That's a good question. My state is still one of the ones that's mostly shut-down.

It might be easier to work at home when you have a chance to get out of the house during your free time.  EOS 3 0 17 That's true. And your suggestion of improving my work space is a good one. I've been working in a modified walk-in closet. I've tried to make it inviting, but there are no windows/etc.... it's kind of a dark cave.  EOS 3 1 18 [Information] Most people didn't plan for the long term because nobody thought that this was a sustainable way to work. By the way, if your company wants you to stay home, then it might help buy the equipment you need to be productive.  EOS 3 0 19 That's a good thought. My computer is set-up on a folding card table. (I tried finding a desk a while back, but there was a huge shortage since everyone suddenly had to buy them for themselves, kids, etc.). I hadn't thought of asking my company to buy me one.

His spending habits are out of control. He thinks he need to reward himself for living. We can't survive if he keeps gifting himself.  EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Wow that sounds like a big problem. Is he aware of how much distress this is causing you?  EOS 3 0 6 I've tried talking to him about it, but he claims that he needs to reward himself or he wouldn't do anything. Like, if he gets up and goes to work then he needs to eat out to reward himself.  EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel that he is misunderstanding life? That he feels that he deserves things just for existing?  EOS 3 0 8 Exactly. And if I push further, he compares himself to other people: "Well, at least I don't hit you." or "At least I'm not an alcoholic" Like I should thank him for existing.

EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Field hockey that sounds like an exciting sport to play!

And he cares when he is sober, but it doesn't seem to be enough to keep him from going back.  EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] You may need to take some time away from the friendship then. To show him you are serious that you can't tolerate the behavior any longer.  EOS 0 0 12 I get that, but I am the person closest to him and he needs my support  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] That's understandable.

I work a lot.  EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] For the time being we're all stuck at home mostly, so maybe take some comfort in that in a strange way. Heck I rarely see my friends - maybe once a year, so I know how that feels.  EOS 4 0 15 Good to know I'm not alone.  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] On the bright side of things, at least you have a job. Do you enjoy your job? Maybe start friendships with coworkers, possibly.

EOS 4 1 19 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I think you know yourself better than anyone else and are about to leap in to a new chapter of your life. You received lessons from both the past relationships and can take that forward knowing what you wish for and deserve.  EOS 4 0 20 Thank you for letting me talk about this. It is a touchy topic, affairs. My heart was so loved during that time but I always told him that if he needed me to step back, I would. It has been difficult on both of us.  EOS 4 0 21 Being a parent, having the families meshed together, homes, work, etc.... I can understand why he feels he should try again.  EOS 4 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] Sometimes talking about why you are feeling is the best way to find closure. Keep the memories of the love and good times but know that in the end you were destined for something so much more. As adults we try so often to find happiness in others. He is a good person for wanting to try to resolve the situation for his family but that does not mean he did not love you or that your relationship was not a bright spot in his life as it was yours. I'm sure he is hurting too.  EOS 4 0 23 thank you so much for saying that. It really means a lot to me and grounds me  EOS 4 0 24 you are correct, that I need to move forward for me. I deserve it. That's a concept I have been learning.  EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions] You deserve peace through this transition.

[contxt]	1 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I would certainly agree with you. That kind of work is unsustainable. Let me ask you this. What would happen if you told your employer you simply could not do these hours?  EOS 1 0 13 hah - i dunno. im on a team of 2 people - and i guess if i dont do it, the other person has to. or it just doesnt get done, and i dont know what happens?? nothing? LOL.  EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] The worst that could happen is that they fire you. But that doesn't seem too likely as they seem to need you. But I have learned in life that if I don't care for myself, hardly anyone does. We need to be kind to ourselves. Set boundaries.  EOS 1 0 15 agreed - i dont think they would fire me, maybe get reprimanded or more likely a guilt trip as to why I cant do it. Im just not sure what kind of boundaries I set when we have things due, and just literally no time.  EOS 1 1 16 [Information] Setting boundaries can be difficult if you haven't done that a lot. When we think we don't have the ability to say NO, then we feel trapped, worn out, depressed, taken advantage of. People need to know that we reasonably can say no.  EOS 1 0 17 Well, I have to set boundaries, because working till 11pm most nights is not sustainable. and who on earth is going to view, let alone sign a contract at 12am  EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I think that would be the first step. Determine how many hours you feel you COULD work. Then advise them that is what you will do. Find out what kind of timelines there are, and if you can't do it, don't go beyond your boundaries. It is obviously destroying your life. It really isn't healthy for you.  EOS 1 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] Exactly. It isn't working for you. Something has to change. And you sound intelligent, so you can determine what will work for you -- perhaps a range of hours, but definitely not 14 hours. Unless you are a young kid. lol Even then, that's a lot.

[contxt]	1 0 4 My friend created a group chat for planning activities and did not include me. She included people who are closer to me than to her. Almost like she is trying to steal my friends.  EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. So when she did this, it gave you the feeling of almost being replaced or abandoned by your own social circle?  EOS 1 0 6 In a way. I was disappointed by the rest of them but mostly angry at her. It almost feels like she wants to be the leader of the group and feels like I am her competition.  EOS 1 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It's definitely frustrating to feel that your support system could possibly become a source of stress and competition anxiety. Especially since it's where we're supposed to feel safe and unjudged.  EOS 1 0 8 Exactly. They are supposed to be the people I can go to with my problems. Now I feel like they all had a secret which I wasn't privy to and it made me feel disconnected and untrusting towards them.  EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds that you're a person who really does care about keeping the relationships they've invested in healthy and open. That care level can definitely cause natural anxiousness in situations like this, when the place you stand with them and what they're thinking suddenly feels uncertain.  EOS 1 0 10 I am a bit of an idealist. I like for everyone to be in harmony, to be nice, supportive, caring, open and honest. I don't know how to move on from this.  EOS 1 1 11 [Information] Right, and there are endless possibilites the mind can create outside of ideal. But funnily enough, the imagination of an idealist that lets them visualize great things can also create equally strong fears before getting answers. And thankfully those fears can be addressed outside of the head where they're made.

[hypothesis_response]	[Providing Suggestions] i think that if you've been spending too much time with people, and not enough time with friends, that may be a reason for your anxiety. if you really care about the people, it might be helpful to spend more time with them. there are many people out there who don'tknow you, and they'd appreciate your patience and friendship. it'll be a lot easier to move away from people who just want to be friends, and you'll definitely have to find new friends who are more willing to be around people who value you, or who care about you, even if they'll take the time to do so for themselves.

EOS 4 0 11 Thank you. I just don't know what to do in this situation. I don't want to keep reaching out when I don't feel like they actually want to keep in contact with me. I know we could still get along well, but it's hard when I'm the only one to make the effort.  EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you have any other friends besides this group? Do you have other people that you could reach out to that are social distancing that you could relate to more during this time that you would have more in common with right now?  EOS 4 0 13 I have very few that have similar thoughts as me that I have tried to reach out to. But most of them have their own lives, boyfriends/girlfriends, and things they do. Mostly everyone seems to be hanging out with people which leaves me physically left out.  EOS 4 1 14 [Question] What hobbies or activities do you like to do?

I did not know that I had anything to be proud of but I can sort of see what you mean. I wanted to get married to him but he never asked and we have been together for 5 years.  EOS 3 1 7 [Question] I am so sorry... Do you think a few years from now, after the pain of this situation has gotten easier to handle, you'll be happy with your decision to end the relationship? I know it can be hard to think so far in the future.  EOS 3 0 8 That is a good point because I have no been able to think about the future at all. I am thinking about what I could have had with him like children. I have wasted so much time and I really want kids.  EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe something you can do is think about all this time in a more positive light. Instead of saying you wasted time, maybe you can think to yourself, "I am so glad that relationship taught me about myself and my standards." Does that sound good?  EOS 3 0 10 I also know that he never wanted kids so I have learned a lot about myself and what I want in life. I can think of myself and what my standards are.

[contxt]	5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Gotcha so not only are you frustrated with what he is doing, but you are also worried about his reputation! First of all, can I ask if he is just your friend online or if you hangout with him in person too?  EOS 5 0 9 That's correct. He is actually a close friend and I wonder what has changed recently to make him like this. I've known him for over 20 years.  EOS 5 1 10 [Others] Okay I see. From personal experience, the best way to confront someone who likes to do most of their confrontations online, is in person. Since he is so used to almost "hiding" behind a screen, his feelings will be more vulnerable and real if you discuss your concerns in person.  EOS 5 0 11 Actually I've never thought of it like that. Perhaps a couple of us can have a conversation with him in person. Honestly some off his views are disgusting. I think this needs to stop.  EOS 5 1 12 [Information] A suggestion I would make would be to hangout with him in person, and bring up the issues that you and your friends have been seeing. But it's important to not make him feel overwhelmed. Almost like he is being "ganged up on."  EOS 5 0 13 Yes that's good advice, I think we need to be tactful and raise it in the right way.

[contxt]	3 0 11 It makes me feel like he didn't learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he's better than me because he has someone new and I don't. I'm trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won't ever find anyone.  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you're doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another.  EOS 3 0 13 Thank you! Exactly. But it is scary. I am guessing from your name that you identify as male (please forgive me if that is incorrect), so you might not understand what it feels like to be an older woman when your ex starts dating someone a lot younger. Men only get better and more desirable with age, not so for women.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] I might not understand that particular aspect, but self worth is still self worth no matter the context. I'd say try not to pay any mind to what he's up to. The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence, but if you just focus on watering your grass (making yourself happy) then you'll have a much more fulfilling life.  EOS 3 0 15 Haha, watering my own grass. That is a good way to put it. Thank you for talking to me for a few minutes. It makes me feel a little bit better to have someone agree that it is okay to spend time working on me, instead of thinking that it is sad or pathetic or an excuse. I really appreciate it.

EOS 4 0 13 yes i've been in a relationship with her for three years  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] If she has moved on from you, as painful as it is, you should move on from her. But that will take time, and it will help to slowly and methodically find a way forward from her. You should not feel like it will happen overnight or that quickly, but distractions and creating a new path for yourself are imperative.  EOS 4 0 15 I cound not stop remember her memories, its repeating and disturbing for all way  EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] For now, that is a normal feeling and reaction, but with therapy and some help, that will lessen in frequency and severity.

[reference_response]	[Providing Suggestions] How about a therapist, if only temporarily?
[hypothesis_response]	[Providing Suggestions] meditation can be effective, but it will also help you become more aware of what is going on in your head. it is very helpful to know that the people who you are trying to move on with are not your friends, they are your friends. if you are not in a good spot, you are going to be in a bad spot.

[contxt]	1 0 16 I feel like I was stupid to do that and soft  EOS 1 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If I may, I would argue that your actions don't make you soft and they certainly don't make you stupid. They are certainly not any reason to be angry with yourself. If I may bring up another cliché: "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me." I would say you're in the "fool me once" stage and it is your friend's actions that have brought you pain. I think you're unlikely to trust her again.  EOS 1 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Also, hindsight is 20/20. What you might see now in ways that your friend might have used you are things that you might not have seen then. We want to think the best of our friends until they prove us wrong. I think you were being the best friend you could be.

And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health  EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] I also recommend making an educational plan.

[contxt]	3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] My husband and I actually have worked with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. We are retired now, but still volunteer. Sometimes we have to let go of our loved ones - they have to hit rock bottom. Very hard to do, but unless they see their behavior as destructive, they don't want to change.  EOS 3 0 10 I agree, I'm afraid that's what I have to do. Another one of our mutual friends passed away recently to an overdose. I don't want to lose another friend.  EOS 3 1 11 [Others] Have you seen the serenity prayer? Knowing what to do, what not to do and accepting life really is a great thing to ask God for. We can't change others. Yet you have to find a way to have peace.  EOS 3 0 12 Yes. I know I have to let go. I've punished myself trying to stay in his life.  EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] It's very hard to lose friends to addictions. It's epidemic in our society now. However, you can pray for them and look for ways to keep your life on track so you don't get lost focusing on them and not where you want to go.  EOS 3 0 14 all drugs are bad, but meth is a truly evil drug.  EOS 3 0 15 It's just rotting his soul and body. He believes he can't stop and you're right, letting go and just sending prayers is all i can really do now  EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] very evil, I agree, I like to write out a list of things I can do to distract myself from overly being concerned, if that makes sense. Like I take time to think about them and pray for them, then I have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where I want to go and how to get there. Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol

[hypothesis_response]	[Providing Suggestions] maybe you should give a prayer to him and see how he feels and then try to keep him in your life. if he says no, then you've got to be honest with yourself and not go giving the same advice.

[contxt]	4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I'm sorry to hear that you haven't had success with routines. I have suffered with sleeplessness due to bad dreams as well. I find doing yoga with meditative breathing allows me to clear my mind, and sleep better. Do you practice any meditation?  EOS 4 0 9 I have never tried because I'm too anxious to stay still for longer periods of time.  EOS 4 0 10 I mean I have tried but its not easy.  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Having high anxiety makes it very hard to concentrate on meditation. I take a medication for anxiety that has helped me a lot. Have you talked to your doctor about your anxiety?  EOS 4 0 12 Yeah, they gave me pills for that but it didn't help me.  EOS 4 0 13 I know its hard to help me, I just feel better by talking to someone.  EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm really sorry you weren't able to get relief with medication. I understand that having someone to talk to can be a relief when you feel so anxious.  EOS 4 1 15 [Question] Do you have any close friends or family that you can talk to more often?

[contxt]	2 0 14 I do feel that part of my problem is that I am afraid to really open up about it. You are the first person I have really felt able to talk to.  EOS 2 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I am pleased that you have been able to open up to me, it is the first step towards you finding your path. Do you find it easy to write things down?  EOS 2 0 16 Yes, it is really much more easy to write my problems down than to actually talk to people about them face to face.  EOS 2 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] One suggestion is for you to write down all the reasons that you love microbiology. It can be any format, I love a bubble chart (mind map), it could be in list form or just doodles, would this be something you would find useful?  EOS 2 0 18 Yes, that is a fantastic idea! Maybe I can find a renewed interest in the subject. I hope that I can because I really do not want my time studying to have been wasted.  EOS 2 1 19 [Question] It would be a really good place to start. Then you could be really kind to yourself and take some pressure off. Would you like to talk through some ideas to help with the work itself?  EOS 2 0 20 Yes I really would. I already feel more motivated! Half an hour ago I felt that I had no place left to go and felt defeated.  EOS 2 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] That's really good, sometimes it is about finding a direction and small steps. Often when we are studying the work seems really big, especially essay questions. One thing that helped me was to break it into really small chunks, sometimes physically covering up some of the question. Would that be something that would help?

O  EOS 4 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] You sound like the absence of the fair has really taken its toll on you  EOS 4 0 10 , A lot of things this year have taken their toll on me. One of my cats died earlier this year; a former co-worker whom I respected died, I'm tired of wearing masks--I'm 53 years old, and I have more acne now than I did when I was a teenager. I'm tired of politics, and I'm tired of hearing my husband talk politics!  EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Wow, I know how you feel as I have had some really traumatic things happen to me over the past few months as well. I understand all too well especially since I had to cancel my trips that were already paid for this year.  EOS 4 0 12 That sucks. I hope you got your money back.  EOS 4 1 13 [Others] Yes I did

[contxt]	3 0 6 That's true. everything just feels so out of control  EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] When i feel like everything is out of control, i try to focus on small tasks that i can complete with ease. Maybe you can focus on setting up quarantine room, or getting medication and food to last for those weeks just in case. Worst case out of that is that you have some extra food and medicine.  EOS 3 0 8 i can focus on the things i can control - that's good advice. what have you been doing to stay sane through all of this?  EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Well for one my house has never been so spotless ha. I have been exercising more, going for more walks with my dog, having more family nights, just anything really that can take my mind of it.  EOS 3 0 10 i haven't felt like doing much of anything, my house is wreck. where are you finding motivation  EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I did not want to let my fears control me. Believe me the first month or so i did just that. I just wanted to feel better. I started small, cleaning one room at a time. Making a small list to get done. Sooner than later the lists got longer, the place got cleaner.  EOS 3 0 12 did you find a list online or make it yourself?  EOS 3 1 13 [Information] I made one starting with the easiest jobs first.

EOS 2 0 10 Maybe I could talk to my friend Sam because she just broke up with her boyfriend.  EOS 2 1 11 [Information] speaking to others who have had similar experiences it's always a good idea. they may be able to offer a fresh perspective that you haven't considered before  EOS 2 0 12 She's worked through the process a little longer than I so maybe she could see things from a more rational perspective.  EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] that's good, I'd definitely reach out to her, especially when the Break-Up is so fresh. you may not be thinking clearly and a friend that understands might really help.  EOS 2 0 14 You are right. I hope this works.  EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you have been through a really tough time.

EOS 0 1 28 [Others] I am so incredibly sorry that you have to deal with all of this at all but especially at the start of the holiday season. My heart absolutely breaks for you.  EOS 0 1 29 [Self-disclosure] Yes, we have a daughter. He spent the first eight years of her life in prison. I gave her the choice as to whether or not she wanted to get to know him. He had plenty of opportunities to speak to her and chose not to call or show up when he was supposed to. The last thing she said about him was, "All he does is lie to me and break promises. I don't want to see him or talk to him anymore."  EOS 0 0 30 And no I haven't thought or going to therapy. I'm not the one who cheated on anyone and this just happened Friday. I didn't know where to start. So I called here  EOS 0 0 31 Are you or your daughter in therapy?  EOS 0 1 32 [Self-disclosure] I'm a great mother and I always put my daughter's feelings first. She made the decision not to see or speak to her father. Him and my now ex-best friend are on drugs and don't have custody of their own children. It's in my daughter's best interest that she doesn't know him.  EOS 0 1 33 [Self-disclosure] Yes, we are both in therapy. It helps immensely.  EOS 0 1 34 [Providing Suggestions] I know that you weren't the one who cheated, but I would still highly recommend talking to someone about what happened.

EOS 6 0 16 I talked to the school counselor. They laid out some options. It's really about money and time. If those weren't concerns, I would switch in a heartbeat.  EOS 6 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] What about meeting with the counselor with your parents, since it seems they would need to support you financially over any extra time it might take?  EOS 6 0 18 That's a good point. Maybe we could have a Zoom meeting, even for just 15 minutes. I need to get my parents to understand my feelings.  EOS 6 0 19 The counselor might help me with that.

EOS 4 0 15 No I am stuck going into work, we are essential enough to stay open  EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Ah, I also know some essential workers who must physically attend work. I am lead to believe that the pandemic inadvertently causes a lot of stress in places that we don't commonly associate stress with. For example, wearing a mask everywhere for us in the United States can become a pain sometimes like when I forget it in the car or the house  EOS 4 0 17 Yes honestly covid has definitely been exhausting. masks have been mandatory here for quite some time so I am never without one  EOS 4 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I don't blame you, its impossible to keep this composure especially with a pandemic breathing down our necks. When I worked, I found that smaller problems that wouldn't normally phase me began to have a greater effect when the pandemic hit  EOS 4 1 19 [Others] Thus my stress went up as a result and wearing a mask didn't help the problem  EOS 4 0 20 Honestly I wear a mask 8 hours a day and its not a big deal  EOS 4 1 21 [Question] Hmm I guess we all deal with the precautionary measure differently.

EOS 2 0 14 I see, I think making a schedule and breaking task into little ones will help complete them. I guess I will stress less.  EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, It will be hard at first because you are not use to it, but once you get started your life will be so much more relaxing. Your stress level will become more less than what is was before. Also, You will be able to have a clearer mind to concentrate on your schoolwork more by having this new schedule.

I think she ends up spending so long making aide memoires that she then leaves herself so little time to actually study.  EOS 0 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can imagine after having heart surgery as a baby she wants to live life to it's fullest extent and prioritizes making memories over school. Does she ever talk about what her plans are for after high-school? At some point she will have to connect the dots of having to get a job to be able to go out and have fun, and unfortunately doing OK in school comes with that. That or a vocational school to learn a trade (what I personally did).  EOS 0 0 15 What did you do? Her interests are music and photography. Recently she has started a gardening club with the horticulture department at school. She does enjoy her social life well when she has been able to have it. She has had social ups and downs but apart from the epidemic she has been happier than in her earlier years at school. You are right she is becoming an adult and will find her place. At 17 I guess she doesn't have to decide just yet.  EOS 0 0 16 You have certainly made me feel a bit more positive.  EOS 0 1 17 [Others] Sorry for the delay. I am glad you are feeling more positive. I was into cars so I went to vocational school to become an auto mechanic. After a couple years of that I realized I wasn't cut out for physical labor and went to college. But the knowledge from working on cars helped me understand things better at college since I had real world applications I could use it on.  EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Gardening and Horticulture is a great hobby! That definitely could cross over into some of her science classes to make things more interesting and relevant to her.  EOS 0 0 19 Thank you so much for your time and kindness today.

This might be a non-threatening way to test out how they are feelng about you. You might be pleasantly surprised, and find that goes well.  EOS 2 0 18 One friend offered me to go for a drink tonight but I haven't replied yet. And also I don't want to talk about my ex at all, that's what I am afraid he can ask.  EOS 2 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] the other thing is these common friends might feel a bit awkard too about the situation. They have to figure out how to relate to you both on your own, it's a change of dynamics, so might take a bit of time to settle out. Can you tell your friend that you'd like to go out for a drink but that you don't feel comfortable talking about your ex at all? Would your friend respect your request if you made one do you think?  EOS 2 0 20 Yes that's true. I believe he might understand me and accept my request. Would be quite challenging if we will meet my ex wth other friends in same pub. I live in a small town.  EOS 2 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] oh I see, yes that could be awkward for sure.  EOS 2 1 22 [Providing Suggestions] i think it's important you go out with your friend, but can understand your reluctance to run into your ex. Could you go out for coffee or lunch instead?

I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her.  EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track.  EOS 0 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind.

EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] It has always helped me.

[contxt]	2 0 0 Hello  EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing?  EOS 2 0 2 I am hanging in there as well as I can be  EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What's been going on?  EOS 2 0 4 I am worried about losing my job. The company I work for has had layoffs and is talking about it again in a few months. This makes me really nervous  EOS 2 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like that fear of losing your job has been taking a toll on you.  EOS 2 0 6 It has indeed. I chose an industry that was fairly stable and a company that hadn't done layoffs in a long time but COVID changed all of that.  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, COVID is an unprecedented time where anything can happen. 
[reference_response]	[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, COVID is an unprecedented time where anything can happen.
[hypothesis_response]	[Restatement or Paraphrasing] so you chose an environment where you were not able to find a job due to a sudden change?
[comet query]	It has indeed. I chose an industry that was fairly stable and a company that hadn't done layoffs in a long time but COVID changed all of that.

EOS 0 0 4 Yeah, I'm really nervous about what's happening. Based on who they let go, I think I'll be next because of tenure and experience level.  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] So would it appear that they are laying off the people who have been there the shortest time first?  EOS 0 0 6 Well it's a mix of tenure and department. They also furloughed another 10% of the workforce as well so we're 20% smaller now  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] I know this is a terrible time to be laid off from your job. Do you feel that you have a contingency plan if you are one of those who is laid off?  EOS 0 0 8 No and we are in a worse position. My wife was laid off from her job 3 months ago. I'm the only breadwinner right now  EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Oh my goodness. Will either of you be able to claim unemployment while you search for new jobs? My brother was recently laid off and he's considering out of state options to hopefully find a job sooner. While that's certainly not an option for everyone, his unemployment is helping to keep his family afloat.

EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure they won't see you as needy or desperate if you've been with the company for 2 years already. Have you initiated the conversation with the board already?  EOS 0 0 5 No. This just happened last week so I am trying to keep all of the balls in the air. I was thinking about talking with them Wednesday this week. They are meeting on Thursday.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] That is a good idea. I would go over your resume and spruce it up before talking to them on Wednesday to add in anything pertinent that you might have learned or achieved during your time with the company these last two years. Make sure the day you approach them that you're well rested, clean and put together. Google some confidence stances and pay attention to your posture. Even if you're feeling nervous there are ways to hide it and appear confident.  EOS 0 0 7 Wow, that's really good advice. Thanks. I didn't think about updating my resume, and I really should have thought about it.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] No problem, I hope it helps.  EOS 0 0 9 Should I talk with my coworker about it?

[contxt]	6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing troday?  EOS 6 0 3 I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I'm too scared to do anything about it as I don't want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can't help it  EOS 6 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through.  EOS 6 0 5 Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I'm a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are.  EOS 6 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it  EOS 6 0 7 What happened out of interest when you had the conversation?  EOS 6 1 8 [Others] Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist.  EOS 6 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Like I said the question has arisen more than once.

EOS 7 0 15 yes i am kinda numb to it but I have to call the police dept tomorrow for a copy of the police report from when my step dad took the baby to them and I dont want to  EOS 7 0 16 No nobody knows except one cousin from my biological dads side  EOS 7 1 17 [Others] You should talk to someone you trust, they might be able to give you specific advice regarding your situation

EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I was exactly in same situations and can fully understand but trying all your options to look for job is good - apply online, call friends or family and see if they have openings where they work, look work online if you get any temporary work which can enable you to pay bills till you find better job.

EOS 1 1 20 [Providing Suggestions] I would suggest for your mental health when the weather is better to move and until then I would avoid areas that can potentially be dangerous and also don't walk home after dark. Also you need to keep seeking council for you anger and racial feelings. I would suggest when you feel very angry to take a deep breath think will your actions help or hurt the situation. To help with racial issues I would like you to sit and talk to black victims who have been victimized by white people in violent crimes.  EOS 1 0 21 I appreciate this advice. It does seem good. I just want everything to get better.  EOS 1 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If you follow my advice I think you will see a great improvement.

[contxt]	0 0 2 I've been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn't go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction.  EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint?  EOS 0 0 4 Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don't have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions.  EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.  EOS 0 0 6 Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products.  EOS 0 0 7 I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract.

EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Just think of all of the ways our kids are learning to adapt to different life situations as well. That's worth just as much as their formal education. Your concerns are valid, and hopefully finding another safer school works out and this whole thing is over soon.

EOS 4 0 19 So, I guess I'll just keep doing what I can and try to stay away from media and the state's tracking site. I had been doing this, but the announcement for the new tier came from the school!  EOS 4 1 20 [Question] What region are you in?

[contxt]	4 1 6 [Information] It takes time to build friendships and relations. The best way to establish the connection is to find individuals who share similar interests with you.  EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] There is no harm to approach people and introduce yourself. Find some common interests by asking a few questions. If you like the individuals' personality and if they seem genuine then you can seek a stronger connection.  EOS 4 0 8 I think it's because I like anime. Maybe people hate me for it. You know, they call us "weebs" and make fun of us...  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Anime you say? I love anime as well! For me, I use the interest of anime to seek groups who are interested in anime as well.  EOS 4 0 10 Do those really exist?

But, I am worried that they may insist on me attending as we get closer to the holidays and in some ways I feel guilty because it isn't just the pandemic that makes me not want to go.

EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, I think people deserve to build whatever home, family, or environment is best for them and shouldn't be judged for it  EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don't think you should feel guilty about that because you are looking out for yourself which is the most important thing.

I am feel sad and hopeless all the time, nothing is any fun, nothing makes me feel that I am doing anything good for anyone.  EOS 3 1 2 [Information] I am truly sorry you are feeling this way. Those feelings can be overwhelming. Have you tried talking to a professional about this?  EOS 3 0 3 I don't have any money to pay someone, my boyfriend tells me to quit having a pity party no one is coming to it and to just get over it. His comments and suggestions have not been helpful. My friends have tried to cheer me up but I can tell they are getting frustrated with me and I try to avoid them now.  EOS 3 1 4 [Providing Suggestions] There are many therapists out there that work on a sliding scale based on your income. Some even offer free sessions. I would look into that for your local area. It also does not seem like your boyfriend is taking the issue seriously.  EOS 3 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I will tell you from experience, ignoring the issue is not going to help.  EOS 3 0 6 I don't mean to put obstacles in the way of your help but I live 25 miles from town and there is no public transportation here and I don't have a car. You have felt like this before? How long did it last? What did you do to get better?  EOS 3 1 7 [Self-disclosure] It lasts until you deal with it. I talked to someone to help me understand why an dhow i was feeling this way. Dont worry about putting obstacles for me heh im here to help you.  EOS 3 1 8 [Information] One good thing covid has done for us is create a surge of telemedicine.
