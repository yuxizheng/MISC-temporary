  "i'm sorry to hear that. what do you mean?",
  "i can understand how that can be difficult.",
  "i'm happy to hear that. what are some of your concerns with the job?",
  "i understand. i've been through a similar situation myself. it is so hard when we're struggling. i think it'll be much easier when you get through this though.",
  "i totally understand. i used to think that all of my friends were like that, but i found that if they don't have a specific hobby, they can't really change their minds about the things that they like.",

  "thank you! i hope you'll enjoy the rest of your day!",

  "do you have any other hobbies?",
  "i understand how you feel. i also feel that you can learn from this.",
  "it is great talking to you. i can tell how much you love your kids.",
  "i am sure your parents will understand. i know i did. i was in the same situation and it was hard.",
  "it sounds like you are not feeling well and you're trying to get through this. i am sure that you have a lot of work to do though.",

  "that is very kind of you to say!",
  "i hope i helped you today!",
  "i hope you can find a solution for your anxiety and worry.",

  "i think you're doing great!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. why are you so tired?",
  "you have to take your time and remember that your friends will come and go from time to time and if they feel like they can't do anything, that's their loss. you are being selfish.",
  "i think you are doing the right thing.",
  "what is your major?",
  "do you feel like you could talk to your friends about the situation?",
  "i'm glad i could help. i'd recommend trying to have some more conversation with your close friends too, because sometimes it helps me to talk.",

  "i understand how stressful that can be.",
  "is there anything specific that you'd like to talk about?",
  "you're right, there are definitely some challenges. it's difficult to put yourself in a position to succeed.",

  "i have been on a similar situation and have felt that i was not able to get to the best of my abilities",
  "i see. i think that would be a great start. perhaps you could consider looking for a new job online.",
  "i have had a similar situation before. it is difficult for me to talk to people about this situation, especially since it seems like everyone is feeling the same way. do you think that maybe that would be a solution?",
  "i understand. i also feel as though i've been getting more and more comfortable in my own personal life lately.",
  "you can try to take a day off from school to spend some time with your son.",
  "i know it's hard, but just remember to take care of yourself and stay strong.",
  "i've been feeling the same way for a while. it's hard to get through a rough time.",
  "you are very welcome. i wish you all the best!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what are you worried about?",

  "it is not a problem.",
  "i'd say that if you're working on it, you should be able to get a lot of money back.",
  "i know how much you are going through, i am so glad i was able to help!",
  "i understand that, i also went through a similar situation and i found that it was really helpful. it was also really good that i could help and help my husband while he was getting laid off.",
  "it sounds like you are having problems with your partner, and that is understandable.",
  "i'd say you're doing the right thing by talking to her.",
  "well, i know that you will be able to get through this if you try hard enough, but i know you will find that you can do it!",
  "have you thought of talking to a professional about how you are feeling?",
  "no problem, i hope things go well for you! i hope you have a great holiday!",
  "i understand that. it is very difficult to get out of bed during the holidays. i am glad you are doing well and i wish you all the best.",
  "that sounds like a great idea. what would you do to stay busy with work?",
  "hello. what is going on?",
  "what kind of things do you do for work?",
  "oh, i see. i understand completely. sometimes the best option is to work in a room where you have someone to talk to.",
  "i've found that sometimes the best solution is to make sure you have plenty of options and a safe place to work.",
  "so you feel that this has been a difficult time for you and that you are worried about losing your job?",
  "i know this has been a stressful year for me and i know that i need to keep my head up and keep calm.",
  "i understand, and you have to be willing to do it!",
  "i have been through a similar situation, it was really hard but it took some time to get over it.",
  "it'll be okay. just remember to do your best and you will be fine.",
  "i know it is tough to have this conversation but i know that i would be willing to help you if i was able.",
  "you should try to talk to your friend about this and let them know that you have been treated badly by him.",
  "it is good that you could discuss it with them, perhaps they would be willing to discuss it and then you could give them a chance to discuss your problems.",
  "bye!",
  "so, you were able to tell her that you were upset and that you wanted her to know why?",
  "it sounds like you have a lot of anger towards him.",
  "i see, so you are worried that your parents might be able to see your future as a valuable person and they may be able too. that sounds very challenging.",
  "how are you feeling?",
  "i would say yes, but you are right. there are a lot of different ways to look at things.",
  "it's been nice talking with you!",
  "i think that'd be a good place to start!",
  "you're welcome! i hope that helped.",
  "i understand. it's a tough time for everyone at the moment. i feel that you are doing your best to reach out and share your feelings.",
  "well, you could try to just focus on yourself and trying to relax. maybe that would help you to get your mind off things.",
  "i am sure you will find a new job one day, but i would also suggest looking online and searching for jobs that would involve a small business or a new company that doesn'tx with you. if you are looking for a new gig, i would say go for something you are interested in and see what comes up.",
  "i can relate to that. i had to take a break from my job after a long year. i went through the same thing with my ex and he got very upset when i tried to talk to him about it. i think that helped me to focus on my work and not the relationship.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. can you tell me more about your situation?",
  "it sounds like you are struggling with a job right now, is there anything specific that you would like to talk about?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i would not recommend trying to fix the problem if you are not sure what to do for it.",

  "what is going on?",
  "i can understand that. when i was a teenager, i used to have a podcast called the app called the same thing. i used it to make my sleep easier.",
  "i would suggest talking to your boyfriend about this situation. it could help you to think of ways to deal with this situation in a positive way.",
  "you are very welcome. have you talked to anyone about this at all?",
  "i understand, i have been in a similar situation. i can tell you are very frustrating at the moment.",
  "thank you for sharing your feelings with me!",
  "that sounds like a really stressful situation. i know it can be difficult when someone is not willing to talk to you during your stressful time.",
  "hello",
  "i can understand that feeling, i was in a situation like that when i was younger and my parents were mad at me.",
  "you too!",
  "you too!",
  "i can tell you are a very good person to help you.",
  "that is a hard thing to deal with but it's worth it.",
  "it's okay, i know you will be fine",
  "hi, how are you today?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have you been feeling anxious at all lately?",
  "i'm sure there are some online courses that could help with your resume.",
  "i have found that in the past i would focus on my studies and not worry too much about my classmates'grades.",
  "i think that would be a great place to start. i think you could also try to play games with friends or play some video games with people you know.",

  "oh no, i am sorry to hear that. what makes you feel that way?",

  "so you are worried about her being angry about you not wanting to spend the extra time with her?",
  "i think you should give it a try. i would start with a few minutes and then maybe set an hour or two to practice your skills.",

  "it sounds like your manager is a little nuts about your boss'position.",

  "i understand. i had the same problem.",
  "you too!",
  "i can totally understand. that would be difficult.",
  "it's been a very difficult year for everyone involved, but i think you will be fine. you'll find a way through this!",

  "i can understand that feeling. i have.",
  "just make sure you stay safe and take care of yourself, that is what matters most.",
  "oh that is so hard, i am so sorry!",

  "you can do it!",
  "yeah, the more energy you feel the better you feel, and you are not afraid to talk to anyone or do anything else to help you feel better.",
  "i am sure it is. i have had to work with coworkers before.",
  "i understand. it is very difficult to be honest with someone who is not very understanding about your situation. i've seen it myself myself myself.",
  "that's a really good idea. i think that will help you feel a little better.",
  "i have been in a few relationships before and always wanted to get help for them and i think that would help me too.",
  "i am glad i could help!",
  "thank you. i hope you have a wonderful day.",

  "oh wow, that'sn't a bad idea. i am sure that would help you to get some additional income.",
  "i would recommend doing a few hours a day to relax and get some rest.",
  "it sounds like you have a very strong heart and are open to the suggestion that you can work through this.",
  "what is your problem?",
  "i have also had a lot of friends in the past. they were very helpful when i was in school.",
  "i'm sure that there are many opportunities out there for you to meet new people.",
  "do you have a family member that can help you out in these times?",
  "i can definitely understand how you feel. i've been there. it's hard for a lot of people, but it'll get better with time. i know it can be hard for people to see themselves, but at least they can understand what you're going through.",
  "i can understand how you feel, but you have to accept that you are not the only one that will get this treatment.",
  "hi, how are things with you today?",
  "what sort of work are you doing?",

  "i think that'd be a good thing to do, but you're right, it'd take a lot of courage and dedication to overcome this.",
  "how long have you been together?",
  "it sounds like you are worried about the vaccine, but don'; t worry about the virus. the vaccine has to be approved by the government first and then approved by a vaccine company.",

  "no problem. i hope you have an awesome christmas.",
  "i can understand that, i have been in that position myself and it sucks. but it seems that you're trying to help.",
  "do you have any hobbies that you like to do?",
  "i'd suggest trying to focus on your own self esteem and self confidence. you might find that that you really want to be the best person you can be.",
  "i understand completely. i have had some issues with my friends too. i think it is because they are so insecure in themselves.",
  "well i hope you feel better soon. i know it can be very difficult to find someone who is happy with your job.",
  "i understand that.",
  "have you considered taking a walk with her at night?",
  "hi there! how are you?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i understand the feeling of being stressed out.",
  "i am sure that would help.",
  "oh no, i am so sorry to hear that. have you been feeling this way for a long time?",
  "bye : )",

  "i am sorry to hear that. what is making you feel this way?",
  "i've been in a similar situation myself. i went through a lot when i was younger, but it's been a good year since i was in the pandemic so i feel a bit better now.",
  "why are you feeling stressed?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i can totally understand how you feel, i have been through a similar thing when my mom died and it was very scary.",
  "i can definitely understand that. i have been in that situation myself. it'll make you feel like you have no right to say anything, and that's a bad thing.",
  "you can also try to find another job in the meantime. it will help you to make time for yourself and your family",
  "i understand how you feel, but there are so many different ways to approach the situation that it's difficult to say no.",
  "you'll be fine. i know it'll feel better once you get over it though",
  "well, i can see how stressful it would be for you. you are very concerned about your studies.",
  "it sounds like you are having a really hard time. what about getting some help from friends and family would you like to talk about?",
  "i used to be in a relationship with a yoga instructor, he was my best friend.",
  "you too!",
  "i can understand how you feel, but i think you should tell him that you are going to be fired from your company, not just from the situation",
  "i can understand why you are feeling that way. have you been able to talk to someone about this?",
  "you are so welcome. i wish you the best of luck!",
  "i hear you... i have had to be a lot more active and find a new hobby..",
  "have you considered looking for another job?",
  "yes, i do. sometimes it helps to get a little bit of each day off. sometimes, it helps me to relax a bit.",
  "that is so hard. i can understand how it feels to be isolated. i also live in fl and have had some family members die when i was younger.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. have you thought about getting a counsellor?",
  "i understand how stressful that must be for you.",
  "you're welcome, i've had this happen to me before. i'll try to make sure to give you time to think about it and make sure it is not something that makes you feel sad.",
  "is this a job you have had for years?",
  "i understand that. it can be very stressful to deal with people you don't know and they will always be there for you.",
  "i can tell you are sad but really you are doing the right thing",
  "i've had my fair share of problems too. i was very sad when my partner died and the panda was not around. i'd say it'd be easier to find a new job.",
  "i think it is important to recognize that you are doing your best and that you deserve to be successful.",
  "it's really hard to understand when your parents are in a relationship like this. it'd be nice to have a conversation with them about it.",
  "i can understand how you feel. it's always hard to be able to have a job when you are struggling.",
  "you have to be very careful when you go through the panda. it'll be difficult to get the vaccine.",
  "what is your problem?",
  "i understand. have you considered getting some sort of support from your doctor?",
  "i'd be afraid to ask, but if you are worried about your job then maybe you could make a plan for an emergency?",
  "i can understand that. you seem to have a lot going on right now.",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "hi! how are you doing today?",
  "i'm glad i could help! i hope you get the vaccine soon too.",
  "yes i can feel that you are worried about your own safety and that is understandable. however, you can overcome this anxiety with a good rest of your life.",
  "you've got this! i hope that you get some help from the people who would like to help you!",
  "i am also in a similar situation. i have had to use my extra time to do my work.",
  "you've had a lot of relationships in your life. are you still friends?",
  "i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that you want to find a new job?",
  "i think you are doing well",
  "i think it is important to know that you have some hope and support and that you will find something you like to do and enjoy doing.",
  "i would suggest moving to a different location. there are plenty of free online support groups on facebook or instagram.",
  "i understand that. i would also be upset if i had to take care of my own home.",
  "i believe that this is the best way to approach this. i believe you will be able to handle this.",
  "oh i am so sorry to hear that. is there anything i can help you with today? i'm here to help.",
  "i am glad to hear that! i hope you have a wonderful christmas!",
  "i am glad that i was able to help! i hope you have a wonderful day!",
  "yes, i am glad i could be of some help",
  "i've been through a lot of this when i was in school too. it can be a stressful time.",
  "i can understand how you feel. i would not want to have that conversation with my husband.",
  "yes, and it'll be hard to see her everyday, but once she's gone it will be easier to see it again.",
  "you need to press quit and take a survey, that's what i do.",
  "no problem. i hope you can get some peace of mind.",
  "it sounds like you have a problem with him and you are looking for someone to be friends with. are you in a relationship?",
  "that is a very hard thing to do. i can understand how difficult that is for you. i think that you should talk to your friends about this and see what they think.",
  "that is so hard. i can understand why you are feeling down.",
  "is there anything else that i can do for you?",
  "you could always try to reach out to her and see if she has any ideas on how to help you",
  "i think that'd be a great way to make yourself feel better about yourself.",
  "i can see how that would be frustrating, however i think that it is worth talking to someone about it.",
  "do you think that she might be able to give you some advice if you ask her for one?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. it seems like it's been happening a lot these days.",
  "it seems like you are both having some problems and that you both have moved on and are not taking care of them. i would suggest that you talk to your friends and family about this and find out what the problem is.",
  "it sounds as though you are trying hard, but you are still trying hard.",
  "i feel that you can do it! i think you should try to find someone to talk to about it.",
  "hi there, how are you doing?",
  "what type of work do you do?",
  "what's going on?",
  "that's so true, i also have a pet cat that i absolutely love!",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. i have been in the same situation before. i remember going through a similar situation. i found that there were times when i had to move on from my family and move on to someone new.",

  "anytime.",
  "do you have any other friends or family who may be experiencing the same issue?",
  "i think you should try to find a new job.",
  "do you have anyone you can talk to about this?",
  "it's great to talk with you too.",
  "i think you should try to find a yoga class that has no physical activity.",
  "i've found that many people have found it helpful to speak to their friends and family during the pandemic.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what do you mean?",
  "do you have any friends that you can talk to about this?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that, i know it can make you feel anxious and anxious.",
  "i can see how that would make you feel a little bit anxious.",
  "that'd be a terrible idea.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i have been there before. it can be very frustrating when people feel isolated.",
  "i think you can do it, but i know that there are other strategies that you can use.",
  "i'll try to help you out. i'd like to encourage you to reach out and talk to a professional.",
  "thank you, i wish you the best of luck!",
  "i know it's hard to get help with everything, but you're not alone in feeling that this is a natural process.",
  "ok so you are having a hard time getting out of this situation?",
