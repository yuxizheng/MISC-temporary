  "you can try doing some breathing exercises like breathing in a mirror or a book, you can also try reading books with meditating.",

  "do you think you could perhaps suggest some sort of solutions that would help you?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. have you tried talking to your parents about this?",
  "i know it's hard to see people in a negative light. i have a friend who is the same way. she has a great job that is very uplifting, but also has a lot of anxiety.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that, i know how difficult that is right now.",
  "what did you think of the situation? did you make a plan?",

  "i know, it is hard, but we have to keep trying",
  "i can tell your parents are very supportive.",
  "i can relate to that, i have worked from home for years and have found that going out and getting a drink in helps too.",
  "no problem, i hope you get through this!",
  "you can do it! i believe in you!",
  "have you tried reaching out to upper managers about the situation?",
  "i think that'd be a good idea. i would have to say that it'd help to talk to him and see if he is understanding.",

  "it sounds like you have some problems that are going to get better, and you should be able to find someone else who is willing to listen to you.",
  "i am very sorry to hear that.",
  "have you tried any other places?",
  "that'll be a great first step. you have to make sure he understands that you care and you don'' t feel like you need him to be in charge of anything else.",

  "i have been in the position of management and have found that if you have a positive attitude, you can get through this!",
  "i found a group of people who wanted to be in a healthy home and they just chose to do it for fun.",
  "yes, the first step is to try to make your friends and family happy, which will take some time.",

  "i know that you feel a bit guilty when you feel that way, but i hope that you can make it through.",

  "i understand that it can be difficult to hear from someone who is so distant.",
  "you are doing great!",

  "i've been in similar situations and i can definitely relate to how hard it must be to be in such a stressful place. i also have a hard time going with friends to the grocery store. i understand how frustrating it can be to have to get into a situation like that to get through a fight, but i have found that it helps to get to know people better.",
  "you'll have to remember that you've been with your parents for a long time and you'd have to wait for them to understand.",

  "i have not, but i have tried a few times and found it helped me.",
  "how can you help me?",
  "that sounds like a great place to live! do you like to do anything else for fun?",

  "you are welcome!",
  "i've got to go now. sorry.",
  "i would encourage you to try and reach out to your boss and ask if he can help you get a better perspective.",

  "i'm so happy you're moving! it'll be a long time until you've made any connections. you'll get through this.",
  "maybe you could try to take some time to yourself before you go to bed and then you could take some of your time to relax with your children, maybe take some deep breaths and get some rest, then take some more deep breaths.",
  "i hope you feel better soon. i wish you all the best with everything you've been through.",

  "no problem. i hope you have a great rest of your day!",

  "if she says that she is going to pay you, you will not get her money. if she tells you that she has not paid you, it will make her feel guilty. if you tell her that you want to pay her, she will feel bad for not being able to do that. if her words are true, then you should ask her why she did that. it sounds to me like she is a horrible person who needs you to do it for her.",

  "i think you should try that, it will definitely help you stay awake and make you feel more energetic.",
  "if you want to talk more, you can always start by asking questions.",
  "i understand how you feel about this. you should be more open to the situation.",
  "i can tell that your friend is very selfish.",
  "i think you could also call him to see if he is still in contact. if he's not, then you could still call him if he isn't, but if he says yes you can just ask him if you could go. if that'd be a good idea then you may be able to make a new friend with your own friends.",
  "yes, that is correct!",
  "have you been able to talk to your boyfriend about it?",
  "i would say that it'll be helpful to talk to her about this and maybe see if you can get her a bit more involved in this type of thing.",
  "that's very good!",
  "i see, that'd be a difficult situation. i know that you've been trying to be kind to him and keep yourself safe, but it sounds like you'd need to really look for every option possible to help yourself.",
  "good luck, i hope you will be successful",
  "if you have a good job and a good family you can get a good girlfriend",
  "i hope that i have been able to help you a bit. do you have any other hobbies that you enjoy doing?",
  "i had a similar problem. i was working at a hotel room and i was always there, but then i found out about how to make things better. i made a list of things i'd like to do. i found that making things more enjoyiable helped. i had to start setting up new plans, but i started planning ahead.",
  "that is a great way to start. you have to make sure that you get enough sleep every day and that you stay awake until the next day.",
  "how did you do it?",
  "that's a good point! i have never felt like that before.",
  "yes, i have. i had to take a few breaks from my job and then i was able to get back into the routine.",
  "do you think you can go back to school?",
  "maybe you could try to set aside time for yourself to take care of your own needs.",
  "you should be able to do this. as long as you keep studying, you can get through the exam without worrying.",
  "have you tried taking some vitamin d?",
  "i would definitely recommend getting a book or a movie to help you relax and get your mind off things.",
  "have you tried talking to your friend about it?",
  "it sounds like you are doing great and doing great! i've been trying to stay positive and take care of myself. i know this is tough, but you are trying to make the best of this!",
  "i know that the first step to getting back into your true self is to get out there and do something you enjoy. it's very easy to become depressed.",
  "are you ok?",
  "don't worry, everything will be ok!",
  "i hope you have a great night!",
  "yes, but he was not attacked",
  "you're welcome! it's good to talk with someone who understands. i wish you all the best in your future.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "if you are really into it, you could also try to try and help her with her appearance!",
  "you as well!",
  "have you considered looking into some other ways to reduce the burden on your husband? maybe he has some ideas that might help him with his stress.",
  "what made her go through that?",
  "i can understand how you feel. there are a lot of people who are struggling with the same things right now. i think it'll be interesting to see how many people are having the same problem.",
  "you are doing the right thing. i hope you have a great day!",
  "i would definitely suggest that you try to be a more positive person to him, but also be prepared for him to continue drinking. i think that would help you feel better.",
  "you are welcome. stay safe and have a wonderful day.",
  "that'll be a good start!",
  "it sounds like you are very open minded about this!",
  "it is not your fault that you don'' t want to have a relationship with him, but it sounds like you are doing the right thing by keeping your friendship and keeping your mind busy.",
  "thank you, have a great night.",
  "i was stressed out because of the test, but i got it done. i'm not sure what happened. i don't know what happened, i just didn'tgo back home and made sure i did my best. i did okay.",
  "i've heard of vaccines! is that something you've been wanting to try?",
  "you're welcome.",
  "that sounds like a great way to get in trouble. i would be so upset.",
  "i think you should talk to your parents about the situation first, i've heard a lot of people going through this feeling that way.",
  "ok. i am also a student and i struggle with my courses as well. i find that i always focus on one topic at a time. i try to keep my head on straight when i need to study.",
  "do you feel like you can make more money than your family?",
  "i think he will be fine. there are a lot of people who don't want to see their kids. i think that'll make them happier.",
  "you're welcome. i hope you get to talk to them soon.",
  "i hope that the pandemic will end soon and that you can find something better",
  "maybe you should just give up on him.",
  "bye",
  "you should tell them that you are upset because you can't do anything about it",
  "you are not going to hurt him by acting like that. you have a good heart and are doing what is right for you, and he has no reason to hurt you.",
  "how long have you been friends?",
  "that is great! there are lots of people who have been through similar situations, and it is important to make sure you keep your distance from them.",
  "i'm sure that she is wonderful, but you should be able to do better!",
  "i'm glad to hear it. i'll bet you're feeling a lot better now.",
  "that's a great idea! is there anything else that you would like to discuss with me?",
  "i hope so too!",
  "is there any way you could talk to him about your concerns?",
  "do you have anyone that you can talk to about this? i know it can be difficult to tell someone you have been friends with about this issue, but it might help to have a conversation about it with them that can help you feel better.",
  "i think you should let him know that you want to have it on christmas, but you don't want him to tell you exactly how you feel.",
  "i think it would be better to start with a new activity, and then see if you can find some new activities that you like.",
  "i can feel your sadness and worry about your future.",
  "well i can understand that, it is hard to see someone with money in a relationship, especially when you have been together for 11 years",
  "i understand that you are feeling down. i know it can be hard to see someone like that. it is very difficult for kids to be in a situation like this. i think you need to talk to your family about the situation.",
  "i can understand why you are anxious about that. sometimes we are not able to tell the difference between ourselves and others.",
  "have you tried any other types of music?",
  "i am also a desk worker, i find that when i get a bit of coffee, i can go to bed early.",
  "i think it's good to take deep breaths. the body will release the energy, but you can also take a breath when you're really stressed, and then you can focus on the activity.",
  "that is great! do you feel like you are having trouble sleeping?",
  "why did she stop responding?",
  "i hope that this helps!",
  "i am not sure what your concern is. but if it is about your health, then it'd be a good idea to look into seeing a professional.",
  "have you thought of making a new project or idea?",
  "and i think you're right. and if they don'want to fire you, that's their problem.",
  "you should do that first. you are doing the right thing by being there for her. you should be there for your friend.",
  "that sounds like a very positive thing to do. i wish you all the best in your future!",
  "i'm sure you can find a therapist that can help.",
  "yes, i use amazon. com",
  "i've got faith in you! you can do it!",
  "have you tried talking to him about his feelings?",
  "i've found that being in control of myself helps a lot.",
  "are you feeling any better?",
  "have you tried to talk to your professor? perhaps you could try to talk with your professor and see if they would be willing to listen to you?",
  "i am so glad to hear that! have a great day!",
  "it sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders and are doing your best to keep going!",
  "do you think that the city can find a solution?",
  "i have and it's been a lot of work but i am hoping to be able to get a job soon.",
  "of course! i hope things work out for you!",
  "you need to make a plan of action and make sure that you are not the one that is controlling and the ones who are being toxic. it sounds like you are the one who is making the effort to be a leader and not the other way around.",
  "i understand that. you need to move on and move on from this.",
  "yes, that is a good point. it is important to know what is going on.",
  "you are very welcome. i wish you the best of luck!",
  "you'll do great!",
  "i am sorry that happened, it must be very difficult for you to get through this.",
  "i've been in a similar situation before. i'd say that's part of the problem. it takes time.",
  "i think you can do it! i would just try to focus on what is important and that will help you get through this!",
  "i think that's a great idea. you sound like a very positive person who's able to help others.",
  "you are very welcome! i hope you will be able to find a good solution soon!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that! i hope that you will find some peace and happiness in your marriage and you will feel much better!",
  "what are some of your kids'plans?",
  "thank you for talking.. i'm glad you like it.",
  "i know that it can. i just know that you can do it.",
  "bye",
  "i think that you should tell her. if she knows you are depressed and says that you are friends with them because you are still friends, then she is a bad person. if you know what she is saying then you can tell her that you feel bad about it because you feel sad about it.",
  "that sounds like a great idea. i have been through a similar thing myself. i found that i felt more connected to people around me.",
  "that is good to hear. is there anything else i can help you with today?",
  "that'll be a good idea!",
  "i think you can do this! you're doing the right thing by talking to your friend and his boyfriend. you are doing the very best you can to be there for each other.",
  "i am glad i could help. i hope you are able to get through it.",
  "i can't, but i hope you find some new ways to help!",
  "you are welcome!",
  "no problem",
  "you are welcome.",
  "i think that if you keep talking to him, he will be less likely to do the same things you are saying. if you try to be supportive, you will have to make it a priority to maintain a positive relationship with him.",
  "are there any other things that could help you out?",
  "i know it can be tough, but it'll get easier. you're doing everything you can to help others and you've got this!",
  "you are right. you are not guilty of anything.",
  "i'd love to talk again!",
  "i am glad i could be of some help.",
  "maybe you could suggest a new hobby or activity.",
  "i hope i have been able to help you and i hope you have a great christmas!",
  "i think that it may be time for a conversation to be had with her. just give her a chance to talk to me and tell me how you feel about this. maybe she has a hard time doing that because of the way she is being treated.",
  "that's true. i would suggest trying to stay safe, as well.",
  "i love a good toast too.",
  "i am glad to hear that. i hope you are able to use your time to better yourself and be healthier.",
  "have you tried to talk to your teacher about this?",
  "no, i am not saying that at all. i am saying that i think you should talk to doug about this and make a decision for yourself.",
  "merry christmas to you as well!",
  "have you considered asking for a supervisor in the meantime?",
  "i know you will get there!",
  "i see.. i am sorry to hear that. is there any other way to approach the situation?",
  "you're welcome. i'm glad to have been able to be of some help.",
  "i'm glad i could help. i've been there myself, and i know how difficult it can be.",
  "it sounds like you are very anxious about this. have you tried speaking to your doctor or doctor?",
  "your welcome! i hope i was able to be of help!",
  "i think that would be a great idea.",
  "just be careful not to let your emotions get the best of you",
  "you are very welcome! i wish you all the best in the future.",
  "if you think that may be a better option, then it might help to talk to her about it. i know that it sounds really difficult, but it'll help you to make her feel better.",
  "i'm sure it'll help!",
  "i can definitely relate to that. i have lived in a lot of cities and have had a lot more issues with it.",
  "yes, it is. it is confidential that he has to talk to her.",
  "i'm sure she is happy that you're listening to her!",
  "i have struggled with anxiety before and it'd make me feel better to be able to sleep. i would suggest taking a deep breath, and meditating or taking a walk to relax your mind and body. it can help you stay focused.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i understand how you feel.",
  "i think you can try asking for advice from other females. it might help.",
  "you seem to be doing great so far and i am very happy for you.",
  "i understand how that feels, i was in a similar situation, and it was very difficult to find joy in what i had done.",
  "i can definitely understand. it is a difficult situation for everyone.",
  "yes, it can be helpful to talk about your problems with others.",
  "have you thought about a therapist?",
  "i feel that we're doing very well in getting through this! i think it'll be a good year for you.",
  "have you tried reaching out to your friends and family? sometimes it helps to vent and talk about how you feel.",
  "yes, i agree. i find that i tend to forget things a lot when i am trying to make a list.",
  "you are welcome : ) i am glad i could help!",
  "that is great! i hope you feel better soon.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that.",

  "have you tried looking for a new job? there are lots of opportunities in your area.",
  "are you doing well at calculus? do you think you could get a b in that class?",
  "well i am glad i could help. i am happy to help you.",
  "i understand that. it'll be nice to have some fresh air.",
  "i think that's great! you have a lot of options for yourself to try and cope with your feelings.",
  "that is very unhealthy and not fair. i would not want to be in a relationship with someone who has such a negative opinion on me. have you considered seeing a therapist?",
  "you too!",
  "you can also try to make a list of things that you can do, like do something that doesn't involve going to the gym, going for a walks, or going to a book club, or taking a shower.",
  "if they are not supportive of your beliefs then you can not control them, if they want to see you as your favorite then they will be able to control you and your life",
  "you too!",
  "i understand. i think that meditation is good for you.",
  "you as well!",
  "it might be better to think about the benefits of saving, like health benefits, and other things you can do when you feel like you are not being able to afford the things you need to do.",
  "you too!",
  "oh, that'll make it more difficult to see them in person. maybe they can feel a little more free and have a chance of speaking with you, too!",
  "are you in a position to do so?",
  "that'll be hard but i think you can get along with others!",
  "i have a hard time with people who can not understand me, it is difficult for me.",
  "i can understand that feeling. i also have dealt with it myself.",
  "i can see that you are feeling this way. but you will get through this!",
  "i am sorry to hear that, is there anything else that i can help you with?",
  "have you ever thought about going to a counselor or just talking to your parents?",
  "you are not overreacting at all. you have been doing this for a long time and you are taking this situation into your own hands.",
  "is there anything else you can do for her?",
  "you're welcome, i hope i could help.",
  "ah, i understand that. is this something that could be resolved by you?",
  "i think there are some very nice places to live in the states.",
  "i hope that you enjoy the trip and it will help you feel a bit better. i have been in that situation and it is a great way to experience new experiences.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i think that you need to take steps to overcome this anxiety.",
  "if you don't mind me asking, what sort of work do you do?",
  "i had a breakup about a year ago. i was in a similar situation where i was feeling down, and couldn't move forward. i decided to do what was right and to have a good time. i found that helped me to move on.",
  "it sounds like you are doing everything you can to stay healthy",
  "you too!",
  "i think that it would be best to start looking for new employment as soon as possible.",
  "i've had to deal with a similar situation before. i found that talking about the situation with my wife was really helpful.",
  "i hope that you have a great trip.",
  "perhaps you should just try to keep things simple and let her know that you are happy with her, and that you don't think you should be the one to get rid of her, not her. i would suggest you tell her that you feel that you should make her happy, but that you really want to get out of this situation, and it is her decision to decide whether or not to be with you.",
  "maybe you could take a few deep breaths and try to talk to her about it?",
  "have you considered reaching out for suggestions? i know a couple of cities have been closed for a while and they have found some solutions that can reduce the number of people who are affected.",
  "have you ever tried to talk to your family about this?",
  "that's a really tough situation. you can do it, you just have to be patient and take a deep breath.",
  "you're welcome. have a wonderful day.",
  "well i was a single parent and it was tough for me to find work, but luckily my husband did have a job. he was able to pay for my education and pay for the bills, which i loved doing.",
  "do you think that you might have been feeling anxious because of the breakup?",
  "i see. i am so sorry that you had to go through that.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "i've been there myself. i have had to go through a lot of challenges myself, but it's okay.",
  "it sounds like you are very angry and angry about this. i would be so scared that you would be able to turn her in to the police.",
  "i think it would be great for you to have a nanny and be able to provide for yourself. i would try to look for a local program to help people who are struggling with their situation. maybe try to contact your local government department.",
  "you are welcome. have a great rest of your day!",
  "yes, i am from georgia. i am very sorry for your situation.",

  "i hope everything works out for you and your friends.",
  "i completely understand how you feel. i have been in your shoes in the past and i know how frustrating it is.",
  "if you are willing to get into that, you can set up your own business plan and try to sell it.",
  "that sounds like a great way to handle it.",
  "i would say that you are better off without her.",
  "i understand that completely, it is so hard to have someone over at once. i know you can do this.",
  "there are many ways to clear your mind. just start with a simple task and you will be better.",
  "is there a way to talk to him about this?",
  "i would recommend that you talk to your therapist about the problem and how you are feeling. it may be a good idea to take some time to process the thoughts.",
  "i understand that, but you have to try and get through it.",
  "how long have you been studying?",
  "i think that's a great way to put it. you're doing your best to stay positive and take care of yourself.",

  "yes, that is okay",
  "i have a friend who is 40 and has a boyfriend. he has been with his wife since she was 16.",

  "you are very welcome. i hope i have helped.",
  "i'm so sorry to here that you are having such a hard time. i can tell that you have a lot of worry, but it sounds like you are trying to be positive and you are doing very well.",
  "i hope that i have been able to be of some help.",
  "i've found that the most helpful is breathing exercises. i use them when i'm doing a lot of work.",
  "wow! that's horrible. it must be really hard to feel like that.",
  "wow! that's a long time! i've been doing it since i was a child.",

  "oh, that's a good point. i think i'd like to suggest finding a new job and finding a job that is more fulfilling.",
  "you don'know what you're doing. you need to be positive and kind to make yourself a friend.",
  "what kind of things do you want to help the younger people with?",

  "have you talked to them about it?",

  "oh dear, i'm so sorry to hear that.",
  "that'll be a good idea. i am sure that you can make it happen!",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "do you have any other concerns at the moment?",

  "i have been married for 10 years. my husband is now engaged.",
  "yes it is, but i'm sure that you can make it through.",
  "i'm glad to hear that. i hope you can find a way to do it!",
  "i think that's a good idea. i think you'd be surprised how many people are able to get along with cats.",
  "it sounds as though you are doing your best to make things better for yourself.",
  "what is the reason why he is being banned?",
  "you too!",
  "so he is not being a burden, but just trying to help you?",

  "you too!",
  "did you feel angry because of your partner or was it just because of their cheating?",
  "i can understand your feelings about the seed in your mind. it must be very difficult for you to believe this.",
  "have you considered trying to make a list of possible options to make the effort? or perhaps making a list that you could go out to a cafe or something? i know you can always do that if you have time, but maybe it'd be a good idea to try and see if you can get one for yourself.",

  "i am glad i was able to help you! i hope you feel better! i wish you all the best in everything you do!",
  "sometimes it takes time for people to respond to calls. sometimes it is a matter of getting it out of your system.",

  "you have to do your best to keep your mind off this, just be patient.",

  "i think it is a good question. i am sure there are a lot of other women who find partners.",
  "i would just talk to him and let him know how you feel. if he does not respond, then you should ask him if he has any other concerns.",
  "i think that's a good idea. if you can find another job, you can get a more permanent job.",
  "maybe you could try to see a local shelter? i know that sometimes it's helpful to have a place close by for people to get away from people.",
  "i would not take that risk. i would suggest you have a good talk with your doctor about your concerns.",
  "you are so welcome.",
  "perhaps you could take a few small walks to clear your mind and take a deep breathe before you go to bed?",
  "if you have a test, you can always set up a study timer, if you don't have one, it won'tdo nothing but study.",
  "it is definitely a difficult time for everyone involved, but i think you can get through it.",

  "you are welcome. i wish you the best of luck with everything!",
  "i think you should be as happy as you can be. it is a hard time for everyone.",

  "do you have a friend who could help you out?",
  "is there anyone you can talk to about this situation?",
  "i am glad to hear that.",
  "you can do it!",
  "i think that is the best way to handle things!",
  "you too! take care and stay safe.",
  "is it possible to talk to them about this?",
  "have you tried reaching out to hr?",
  "if you feel comfortable talking to him about it, i think it would be a great idea. if you don't feel comfortable, then it's best to go ahead and talk to him again.",

  "it sounds like you are really struggling right now, and you are not doing anything to help that.",
  "i am glad to hear you are trying to build relationships with people.",

  "i understand that completely. i have been in a similar situation myself.",
  "have you tried reaching out to your boss and asking to speak to him?",

  "you are very welcome. i hope i could be of some help.",
  "well, it sounds like you're doing your best and making new friends, which is good.",
  "i am in college right now and i like to read and play video games. sometimes you can even look at something you enjoy that you enjoy doing, such as watching a movie or playing video games with friends.",
  "maybe there is something out there that is worth looking for.",
  "it's no problem. i know it can be hard to start small but it can happen in time.",
  "i've been there, it'll be okay!",
  "what do you think might be the way to end the marriage?",

  "that is great! i think you will be fine!",
  "do you have any friends or family you could talk to about this situation?",

  "yes i am. i have been there many times before and i like it.",
  "that is understandable. i think you are being selfish for not letting them know where you were. it sounds like you are a very strong person.",
  "sometimes, a person's mistakes are not a big deal and they are just a result of their own insecurities. maybe you should give her a second chance?",
