  "it sounds like you are unsure of how to deal with favoritism in the workplace. i have dealt with similar situations.",

  "yes i'm real and i hope everyone come out from this",
  "they might open up if you are hosting.. people are generally nice to the host..",
  "nice! well, two kids is a lot, especially since they aren't in school yet. you are dealing with the care and growth of the most complex organism on this planet.. times two! that's incredible. first of all, give yourself a pat on the back for that. secondly, is it ok if i ask if you felt guilty for having fun without them? often times guilt robs us of the ability to take care of ourselves, which happens to me all the time.",
  "why did you break up?",
  "me either, i had never seen a resume with a picture. yes wear a nice suit and look good.",
  "actually i do not have any background counseling, but i have been through a lot on my own. i have learn to enjoy life no matter what with those that i love and enjoy myself wholeheartedly.",

  "your anxiety might come from the pandemic. a lot of people have this problem.",
  "i think you hit the nail on the head that it's helpful to have that support.",
  "is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her?",
  "i don't think she is a place to be able to see anyone but herself. she is self centereed self asbored and self pity party and doesn't care about anyone but herself right now. is that accurate?",
  "im proud of you for finding something that calms you down",
  "yes, a good idea, it pleases her.",
  "someone who has seen you interacting as a family and maybe has noticed it as well.",
  "yes just remain calm with him",
  "that's understandable, especially with how the past year has been. everyone is on edge and everything feels so uncertain, but that's okay, because you're not alone = )",
  "you are very welcome",
  "i used it a bit, i mainly used indeed.",
  "have a great day!",
  "i use facebook, instagram, and sometimes tiktok",
  "of course! i hope you do as well and happy holidays!",
  "is the project something you will become responsible for?",
  "and please don't think you are disliked because you are obese. i can assure you, you are beautiful.",
  "i would be subtle about that tactic.",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. breakups are never an easy thing. i've also gone through those and they can make you feel awful.",
  "sounds like you are onto something with the ski resorts- sure hope something pans out",
  "yes, i have kids. to look them up i need to stay motivated and positive because i am the reflection to them.",

  "it's not about you even though you got hurt the most",
  "are you looking for job?",
  "i know, as a woman myself. that it is quite difficult when you are seeing someone but have no idea what their intentions are.",
  "i understand. is there a coworker or mentor that maybe you can talk to?",
  "no problem! i'm glad i could help or at least try to help",
  "it can be frustrating to focus on your last job, especially if you haven't found a new one yet. perhaps once you find a new job your disappointment with the last one won't be so disappointing anymore. if the new job is better you wouldn't have found it working the last job.",
  "you can actually use this as a motivation to show your ex how much he missed",
  "yea, with young kids it is hard to tell sometimes",
  "oh that's nice",
  "it seems like the best thing you can do at the moment is try your best to do the best you can at your job. if there will be paycuts, you might not be able to prevent it. but at least you will know that you gave a valiant effort.",
  "do you have someone you could possibly study with?",
  "don't forget there are always options if something does happen.",
  "does he have any close male friends?",
  "sometimes, you just have to have hope. i know you will find a job. you will find something better.",
  "you will find someone that will be a better fit, that is to be sure.",
  "try other strategies first if you dont find them helpful and if you can afford a counsellor then you can try going for therapy.",
  "no problem! don't stress and just work on improving yourself!",
  "have you other friends?",
  "we're almost there!",
  "have you tried talking to her about it?",
  "did you try searching for new jobs?",
  "i am a little confused. are you looking for employment or not?",
  "maybe they are talking about ways they could help you out but do not want to speak about it in front of you as to not make you feel like a charity case or worse about your situation.",
  "have you considered things like journaling, reading, or arts and crafts?",
  "i think a good place to start would be your doctor - they might be able to refer you to a counsellor.",
  "well it's been lovely talking, i hope to see you again sometime : ) take care!",
  "peer to peer support. you can. try to google it!",
  "it would help you work on your self confidence and you might find that you are not doing as badly in school as you think you are.",
  "journaling is an excellent idea!! it has helped me a lot! it can help you discover things you might not have otherwise thought about.",
  "studying can be really difficult, especially when you are half way through. i struggled in my studies and found that talking to my tutors helped and approaching student support. have you tried anything like that or has your motivation held you back?",
  "life will get better for you each day. the healing of the heart and mind takes time but it gets better.",
  "yeah, if they don't care about you, why waste your time on them? spend that time on treating yourself a good meal or a great movie",
  "most definitely. i wish you the best. if you every wanna chat again just stop on by!",
  "that's too bad. normally i would send them an email, see if you can schedule an online chat.",
  "you too!",
  "from talking with you i can tell this has been a real blow and need to find a way to move on.",
  "that is tough... so you are feeling uprooted as well as bereaved? i can only hope things go well for you",
  "it will remind you of a time when you were in a good place, and hopefully project that feeling back to you",
  "you're welcome. i hope you find peace within and happiness again. your grandson will improve with time, it's inevitable! but stay positive, stay focused, and be sure to not take anything out on him as he relies on you and your input. have a wonderful day!",
  "i am glad to hear that you have someone supportive in your life. what is your current line of work?",
  "why please don't feel like that i hope you will come out from this very soon",
  "have you talked to your professor about the reason for the grade you got that dropped your grade below an a? often it helps to understand what we did wrong in order to know what we can do to improve.",
  "when",
  "it is hard to lose friends that we have had for years. maybe you can write that on your list - perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that. that way you open up yourself to make new friends.",
  "you're most welcome : ) we need to keep talking till fifteen mins is up though. is there anything else you'd like to talk about?",
  "and i know that sounded presumptuous of me to say you are ahead of lots of people\", but it does seem like a positive\" in your favor.",
  "i have personally had to learn how to not buy into false guilt. if you had plans, then they can ask some people to help out. however, i would consider maybe being flexible one day or two, but not out of guilt, but out of concern. i would personally pray about it. it's a hard situation.",
  "it might be a good idea to have this conversation with your boss. hold them accountable for this part of their job.",
  "it sounds like you have a lot going on at home and with the way of the world right now i think your are trying your hardest.",
  "are you familiar with mr. rogers'story about looking for the helpers when things go bad?",
  "i understand, it's hard to be positive right now",
  "yes, i can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you.",
  "for anxiety and stress i would sugesst taking time out away from all your chores and tasks and just be to yourself. what is something you enjoy? may a cup of tea or an episode of the office. you always have to take a moment for yourself",
  "i know it can be frustrating when we don't do well, but that's ok.",
  "i know it is harder to see the brighter side of things when depression is involved but it will get better!",
  "please remember to take the survey : )",
  "exactly, keep calm and relax. avoid any negative vibes. aim is to distress yourself.",
  "i like to run every morning, and it seems to help make alot of stress evaporate.",
  "i'm interested in your free lance work. what kind of stuff are you doing? is it a passion thing or a paying hte bills thing?",
  "do not worry, your fears are totally grounded. some people really just need to grow up and get educated.",
  "i'm jealous. hehe i often wonder what our friends to the north are going through. i'm glad to see you reaching out too. that's awesome!",
  "sounds like you've learned an important lesson from this, and will work towards responsibly paying it off. i have faith in you!",
  "try do get some online jobs so that you can cop up with both your college and finances.",
  "i went through a similar experience during my schooling, and i had to explain to my parents that i don't want to disappoint them but i still have to do what makes me happy. having a career that you hate doesn't feel good - i've been there",
  "what has been making your depression start?",
  "if you are sure you are ready for it then no. however make sure you dont judge them by previous relationships.",
  "yeah do your best : )",
  "things will get better for you to",
  "thank you, i hope you do too!",
  "of course. i don't know if they dressed up for halloween, but see if they want to dress up and take some pictures for grandma. pictures and voice and video are wonderful in these times.",
  "is there anyone else besides your specialist and your kids that you can reach out to for support in your community, even if it's just by pone?",
  "don't put yourself under too much pressure if you are suffering yourself.",
  "great minds think alike! is there anything else you wanted to bring up with me today?",
  "you are very welcome! i hope you have a wonderful day!",
  "okay i need help to you.",
  "then do you think making such plans with your friends and playing games and reading books can make you happy again?",
  "okay, can you press quit first as i am not able to do that from my end : ).",
  "do not give up on your friend. everything will get better for him.",
  "what other hobbies do you have?",
  "well thanks : )",
  "they should be able to provide you with a list of reputable services local to you.",
  "just strictly told them to do study 1st and got a good mark then only you will give them their phones.",
  "perhaps on the interviews you are doing something wrong, because it have been a while",
  "is the friendship more important than the money? that is what it came down to for me.",
  "i think you could give the booze a break for a week, and see if you may see things in a different light. zero judgment from me btw, i am also clearly on mturk, and i quit drinking in april after ten years of heavy heavy drinking. almost lost my marriage to it. it's not easy, and i'm not preaching, but i am saying it was the best thing i could do to begin to improve my life and my health, mental and physical.",
  "ouch! that sounds hard. i had friends like that too. i had to walk away. has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him? the reason i ask this is because it's good to get some closure and let them know their behavior is destructive and you need space from that.",
  "have you spoken with her since she left?",
  "of course! i hope the rest of your year goes well",
  "that's great i too love star wars",
  "that's good, i hope they went well for you.",
  "yes, thats the spirit!",
  "you will also be used to it",
  "anytime",
  "have you tried going to any higher up? perhaps in the hr department?",
  "yes getting lost in a good book is a great way to get your mind off of it!",
  "a lot of people i know benefited from talking to an advisor or counselor for some direction. have you done that recently?",
  "ah, yes, that makes sense. and working from home is infamously hard, again, for lack of boundaries, so in addition to just not seeing people and getting the casual affirmation and confirmation messages on a daily basis of like hey jim you did a great job on that spreadsheet\" or haha jessica you're so funny\", we also are writing papers in our pajamas and bedclothes, which makes it seem interminable.",
  "i don't think so. maybe they are waiting for you to say first and give you advice, they have more experience after all",
  "i can totally understand why you're feeling that way.",
  "anyway it's been really nice to talk to you and i hope that everything goes your way",
  "bearing in mind that you are not going to be paid for this hit unless you actually make an effort.",
  "i am nearly 50 as well. people over 50s looks better and i am sure your appearance is good as well. it is just thinking.",
  "tell them what you think in your mind and they will surely understand.",
  "ah, i hear you, i am in the same position. where would you ideally like to see yourself in six months time?",
  "is there anything i can do for you today?",
  "what is on your mind?",
  "and now for that one friend, does he know the other friends personally?",
  "i feel alone sometime as well, so do not feel misunderstood. i believe it may be natural for us to feel this way from time to time.",
  "if you try to be strong and evere you can do it",
  "oh! that's very sad but try to move out from this",
  "don't worry yourself to much it is going to be okay it is really a tough time that everyone is going through right now",
  "have you considered new activities, like hobbies?",
  "perhaps you should make a plan for some sort of treat a month from now, when things will hopefully be better? perhaps go out for a pizza night with friends or something?",
  "i am really sorry you are having to go through this. you sound like a very strong person that will find the right solution. it took a lot for you to seek support.",
  "i think it's important you go out with your friend, but can understand your reluctance to run into your ex. could you go out for coffee or lunch instead?",
  "then told them to study or else you will broke that mobile.",
  "what will that do in the long run though?",
  "yes i think it's very great we were able to connect on our issues! it definitely helps. you are welcome! : )",
  "yeah you can trust me : ) i think we have a bit more to go.",
  "have you tried reaching out to mayor's office to see if there is any way you could request for more restrictions. most of the cities do have a hotline or a channel for residents to give suggestions or request something",
  "the holidays can bring back memories, but you have other family around right",
  "with telling him you can be free from all guilt",
  "i am also in this situation at work, i have used breathing methods to calm myself down which worked, have you tried anything like this?",
  "yes, i agree that it is hard to find people who can help and not cause more harm. online communities on reddit have specialized groups for people with your situation too.",
  "do you workout?",
  "i apologize. that is much harder situation. are you unable to fight it due to the covid19 moratorium on evictions?",
  "this can be very stressful and lead to a lot of problems in a relationship if not dealt with early.",
  "no you should not have to feel you made a mistake for the time you are taking out of work for a necessity.",
  "glad i could help. please stay safe and no matter what you decide to do, you will be fine.",
  "yes, if you are doing longer videos, i recommend youtube. what you can do, is do a short clip on tiktoc and then in that clip instruct viewers to follow your youtube channel",
  "i feel the same way. i hope you can get things on better terms.",
  "another suggestion i've been mentioning to others suffering from the mental stressors that covid19 is causing is considering speaking to an outpatientoccupational therapist. is this something you'd be willing to consider?",
  "what do you do to cope?",
  "sometimes it helps to just talk.",
  "haha",
  "that way the other person can call him off",
  "no problem. stay safe.",
  "passive entertainment is not bad, but it does not help you make friends. zumba and other activities are great for health and can help you meet people. is there a place in your neighborhood?",
  "i would continue trying to reach out to him and until you can get in touch with him maybe find some thing to do to occupy your mind as to where it does not bother you so much.",
  "that's very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out.",
  "how long have you been in a relationship with your man?",
  "the key, however, is our mindset and how we approach the problem. if you are afraid about going our during peak hours, you can step outside during nonpeak hours. this is just an example. everybody's situations and preferences vary.",
  "thats good the more time you have to devote the better!",
  "i understand that, i would suggest anytime you get too overwhelmed to try and take your mind off of things by watching a video or doing something you enjoy doing in your spare time.",
  "are your friends drinking with you? do they know you are trying to drink less?",
  "wow, that's really a hard thing to deal with isn't it?",
  "i'm sure it's frustrating when you know you're correct and no one believes you.",
  "you too! have a great day, and good luck with work!",
  "it really sucks, doesn't it? and it's not a walk in the park to get over someone when you've been so close to them. breakups are kind of like a bad cut. they really hurt for a bit, but then a scar eventually forms over it and you start to forget about it.",
  "how long have you been working there?",
  "you're feeling a bit like a punching bag because she has chosen such strong words without a reason, right?",
  "in all seriousness though, with hindsight i realise that our separation was for the best. i think and hope that you will realise this in time too",
  "correct me if i am wrong, but were you meant to go on a trip somewhere with her?",
  "bye!",
  "and you too!",
  "my daughter has addictions and alcoholics anonymous is helping her stay clean, she told me",
  "it sounds like writing your feelings down helped you greatly in the past. may i suggest going back to writing and even letting someone you trust read what you have written down to understand how you are feeling?",
  "what kinds of things do you think might help with that?",
  "i would stay away from twitter.. it's very toxic.",
  "it sounds like you have a great plan in place! i'm glad to hear you are feeling less angry now! : )",
  "thats the spirit : )",
  "journaling is for you. no one else has to ever see it if you don't want them too. glad i can help.",
  "i know that is a really rough thing to go through. do you have anyone at home you can talk to as well? just letting it out helps sometimes.",
  "if he isn't interested in the job himself i'm sure he wouldn't see it that way. it is natural for people to try to move up in a company when a job opening appears, especially in these current times. if you don't go for it then someone else will.",
  "it is a pleasure to help : )",
  "i understand that you're frustrated and sad. i would feel the same way too. i think that anyone else in your situation would feel the same way.",
  "i understand your feelings. if it is a true love, she will also understand your feelings.",
  "crossfit may not be for everyone, but do you think a new hobby may help you? have you taken one in recently?",
  "why is she turning everything around on you?",
  "i can feel how bad or lonely you might be. it must be a stressful.",
  "nonetheless, there is no need to make it the entire focus of your life, especially if it is impacting on other aspects of it.",
  "you are a strong person. you are almost there to win. your family is always there with you.",
  "so, you feel frustrated both by your roommate and also the conditions in your country?",
  "it was my pleasure.",
  "i am really sure you will get a job soon as long as you stay looking and putting in applications",
  "that sounds horrible especially that she is dragging your daughter into it.",
  "i can understand how you feel being such competitive environment. however, the most important is your well being. i think as long as you do your utmost best, there is no need to stress over rankings",
  "okay, have you recently moved away from your family? that sound very difficult being so far away.",
  "and i hope my advicesuggestions have been helpful!",
  "you are certainly welcome. i'm glad i could help.",
  "it sounds like you're finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it's the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. does that sound right?",
  "i hope i have been able to help you. enjoy your day!",
  "so, what sort of clothes do you think you are going to buy? : )",
  "listen you have to be kind to yourself, forgive yourself of whatever it is that is bothering you and then let it go.",
  "how long have you been in this longdistance relationship?",
  "i've personally enjoyed looking into all the different types of religions and spiritual beliefs from around the world. it's nice hearing about different beliefs on life and death.",
  "not a problem at all. have you tried maybe going for a walk alone, clearing your mind, seeing where you are at?",
  "i'm happy to hear that, i wish you luck and take care of yourself.",
  "what do you enjoy?",
  "have you tried to talk to her again recently?",
  "united states- louisiana",
  "yes, trust matters.",
  "i think you have it. you too.",
  "this is a safe place with no judgement express yourself in what way you would like",
  "i enjoyed chatting with you. take care.",
  "from chatting with you i can tell you might be ready to start talking and maybe get some help or advice, family is a great start they are typically a great support system. it is okay to feel embarrassed but being unhappy will eat at you, sometimes its good to set our pride aside so that we can figure things out. in my situation of feeling stuck i was ashamed that i sat and let people treat me so badly but it wasn't until i seen it as a problem that i started making my lists and getting advice. some things we do on our own and some its good to have people to help. i think reaching out to your sister would be worth a try, she might also have different ideas and suggestions you haven't thought of yet.",
  "oh wow! i live right outside of philadelphia. i have several friends who have houses on lake wallenpaupack. it's beautiful up there!",
  "yes i normally use netflix.",
  "that sounds like a great idea! it sounds like you care a lot about your kids, i bet it's easy for you to be grateful for them - )",
  "it is understandable. i hope that i have been able to help you a little and thank you for talking it out!",
  "i went to couples therapy to help work things through. would you consider that?",
  "his smile is in your heart and you can still feel him",
  "it all sounds very promising. if you think they'd not tell your boss why don't you talk to some of your connections and see if they can put you onto something better?",
  "i will put you in my prayers",
  "i can understand that would make you feel anxious and depressed.",
  "great, make sure you do it, it might be rough at first but stick with it and im sure youll do great.",
  "your welcome",
  "people who care about you often don't need the details, just that you need them",
  "bye now! god bless!",
  "under any circumstances, make sure you know you are not at wrong here i hope it will not be the case but your friends might try victim blaming",
  "sorry was afk give me a second to catch up : ) )",
  "just make sure it doesn't happen again because you need to learn from this mistake : )",
  "that's great! you must have a special talent for personalizing your gift selections. perhaps focus on that reaction from you nieces and nephews to support your motivation for giving gifts this year.",
  "that is understandable. people can be hard to deal with at times. what did the coworker do that upset you?",
  "because she won't and she will end up leaving",
  "no no do it now. you might have written a best seller and not know it.",
  "i think you have done everything you can to be prepared for the test. and know a few strategies to help you cope with your stress. i think you will feel much better once it's over!",
  "it has been a crazy year i am glad that it is almost over.",
  "have you spoken to your doctor about your low mood?",
  "your welcome hope my suggestions helped you today",
  "smoking and drinking alcohol can cause sleep problems before bed. do you do those things? what troubles your rest, you think?",
  "hopelessness might be something that you have learned because you have expectations.",
  "have you thought about seeking advice from a close friend or family member?",
  "life is easy. we made it too complicated.",
  "we all go through similar situations in all of our lives. its not about going through those situations it about for me what did i learn and how will this make me better in the future.",
  "do you feel that you have to hit unrealistic goals and meet unrealistic expectations?",
  "you can then tell her stories about them that go with the pictures, it will make them more meaningful.",
  "how about create an online study group with your friends if you need to get a degree in time. either zoom or skype is user friendly",
  "thank you! it was nice talking to you too.",
  "i'm really glad to hear that. it still might feel tough, but truly things are not hopeless",
  "i am so glad that you are feeling better. just rest assured that i will be here for you should you need to talk to some one and i will do my best to support and guide you.",
  "have you looked into other universities for the possibility of transferring",
  "maybe try ubing? there are a lot of interesting channels that talks about science, technology, personal health,... etc. that can be beneficial to you and worthwhile.",
  "that and there are some great books out there also!",
  "that's a long time.",
  "have you spoken with her about this?",
  "that's okay. sometimes it may be you or other times it may be him that gets invited but that's how things will be since the situation transpired.",
  "yes it's been done : )",
  "are you spending time with them like you did before, have you talked to them>",
  "i'd suggest how much she's helped you since you are in fact the new kid on the block. and tell her that you want to work with her to have the most efficient partnership possible and use each of your talents to the best of your ability. then you can lay out how you work best and see where it goes from there.",
  "so i would like to encourage you on the youtube channel idea.",
  "if he's in a certain mindset, it would be hard to change that.",
  "thankyou bye",
  "make interest",
  "doing that and practicing mindfulness can be helpful in calming people down.",
  "i think that's a great idea! people probably want to connect without having to talk about work. later on, they might want to do the same thing but facetoface.",
  "then, within that, one task at a time. segment things he wants to do then reward him with them upon successful completion of schooltasks.",
  "common sense, sorry.",
  "it sounds like a really toxic relationship - i hear you! i have been in that position also. in the end i felt that i had no choice but to leave. i cannot tell you what to do, though.",
  "even though it doesn't feel like it, affairs have little to nothing to do with the people who get hurt the most",
  "ah i see",
  "it is so hard to figure out where to start sometimes. ok, i'll help with a plan. maybe you can glance at the dishes and pull out the largest one that is dirty. let's start there.",
  "walk outside, away from the students waiting for their tests.",
  "when my kid have cold, i nebulize her and later it make her sleep well",
  "has your work life been affected by the pandemic?",
  "it is difficult for others to understand unless they are in the situation.",
  "create your own fun, head to the beach, go to the park, take a drive to the countryside and enjoy the fall. and of course spending more time in your garden will be a great distraction.",
  "on that note thank you for talking and have a lovely day!",
  "i said: that is really hard. do you feel comfortable telling these people how their words hurt you?",
  "the good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there.",
  "you are very welcome! i hope you have a great rest of your day and please don't hesitate to message if you want to chat again!",
  "there must be liability concerning your injury.",
  "so we are about the same age then! i encourage you to write down the strategy, while the ideas are simple, sometimes they are not easy! we must make a choice to do what is healthy! god bless you!",
  "don't be afraid to express your feelings and confide in others about your emotions and mental health. it is still a loss and something you should feel comfortable grieving.",
  "i don't either to be honest but a lot of young girls are interested in it",
  "it would be fantastic to hear how positive your situation turns out.",
  "do you have any friends that you could maybe start babysitting for or cleaning houses for? sometimes i post on my local moms group looking for small jobs and luck up there.",
  "try to left past in pin",
  "have you thought about the possibility of meeting people online that share some of the same things that you like to do and that you could talk to?",
  "hopefully this conversation helped with some of your anxiety and stress!",
  "consulting some literature for friends and family of alcoholics may be useful as well, alanon or something like that.",
  "stay well and safe to you too! take care.",
  "glad to hear it. also, once you feel you're ready, there are plenty of ways to meet new girls. there's the obvious places like online dating or bars, but also some not so obvious like the farmers market or shopping",
  "perfect! it sounds like you may have found a solution to help you get out of this rut and blah\" feeling",
  "well quite! you can easily move forward with your life. he will not find it so easy. but do get the dog back.",
  "your most welcome!",
  "oh wow! i didn't know - 3 more minutes. we can do it! i'm glad i don't have to study and take exams. after the exams are the worst! not too badly right now. but every day is a new day : )",
  "how often do you get out for fresh air? sure it's not going to solve the lack of friends but it does help to clear your mind to go outside the next few months after work.",
  "you are very welcome.",
  "i've been left before too. it was one of the most painful experiences of my life.",
  "i'm glad to hear that you are not too stressed about it though.",
  "i can understand how you feel. i was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school.",
  "most likely! the only thing keeping me from saying definitely is because i don't know all the info. but sure.",
  "you deserve peace through this transition. it will take some time but i think you will come out even stronger and happier on the long run. journaling may be a great outlet for your emotions as well.",
  "no problem. i hope you feel better.",
  "that's not a good spot to be in, i completely understand.",
  "obay your parents advice.",
  "we just have to wait and follow all the guidelines.",
  "i see. over time you'll definitely be able to get over it. there are so many other women out there that are better than her. she may have been the perfect woman for you at one point but you really should come to terms that she isn't the one for you anymore.",
  "usually when people feel singled out, they only have a few mechanisms. unfortunately, most people tend to run away instead of fixing things. it tends to be the easier option.",
  "does she live with her family",
  "it just takes finding the right volunteer groups and being willing to be proactive.",
  "how about you hang out once a week with your friends and share your problem with them?",
  "i find it to be a really good way to connect with everyone. also having an activity gives structure to it.",
  "i have heard of sites like fiver where people work on their own. with enough exposure, you can make a living out of it, and you get to be your own boss!",
  "it may also help to contribute some money to keep the organization going.",
  "ok. socializing with coworkers is sometimes part of the job. of course, your relationship with him is much more important, or it should be to him. what does he say when you talk to him about this?",
  "i understand. what have you tried to overcome your depression?",
  "i can feel your anger and disappointment.",
  "that sounds like a great idea! that's an awesome skill and sounds like it would be fun to get back into.",
  "maybe your body needs to rejuvenate",
  "i know how hard this is, but i also know you can get through it!",
  "oh wow, well its good that an explanation was there for him to understand. as time goes on, it will become easier",
  "i can definitely understand this feeling, as i was also very worried at the beginning of the pandemic about my job security.",
  "are you a real person or a computer program?",
  "is your room quite dark?",
  "it would help more than you think it will",
  "well, i believe that there are some new advances in migraine treatment at the moment so i think things will improve for you. i am sorry if i am not being more help.",
  "how much do you want her in your life?",
  "watch youtube videos",
  "that sounds very hard. i can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn't want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself.",
  "that is good to hear. is there anything else you would like to talk about?",
  "exactly. it isn't working for you. something has to change. and you sound intelligent, so you can determine what will work for you - perhaps a range of hours, but definitely not 14 hours. unless you are a young kid. lol even then, that's a lot.",
  "very first you have to calm down don't break your friendship so easily. friends are like gems it's my request not to give up",
  "wow, it's slightly uncanny the way our situations are similar. for someone who is also not in the best place financially and just making the bare minimum, it can feel hopeless sometimes.",
  "you seem motivated to get better, so i am confident you will be successful. you deserve to feel wonderful.",
  "thats great then, online businesses are less likely to fail",
  "the worst breakup came a year before i met my husband. in retrospect, it was the best thing, listen you could have married this girl, count your blessings. cheating is just terribly destructive. and you are welcome. take care of yourself. write the list of goals and fun things to do, choose one every day.",
  "i wonder if there is anything nice you could do for yourself when you are talking to him that would make it easier to talk to him.",
  "i completely understand, the pandemic and having added responsibility definitely has been very isolating and can feel like you're losing your sense of self.",
  "shake all your negatives",
  "i see! i love your career goal. when i was a student, i visited my professor's room a lot. i did that for almost all classes. some professors helped me a lot and gave me a lot of hint. do you visit them as well?",
  "i have also been worried recently about finding another job because of the pandemic, but i found that getting back into my hobbies has helped keep me distracted and get my mind off of it.",
  "if they are worries, maybe a counsellor would help.",
  "okay",
  "that might not be possible at the moment. work is scarce. i've looked for extra online work, but so many people are trying to get the same work!",
  "i would say maybe try some meditation or something to calm and center yourself. if you feel ready earlier than wednesday then follow your intuition. you've got this!",
  "right, and there are endless possibilites the mind can create outside of ideal. but funnily enough, the imagination of an idealist that lets them visualize great things can also create equally strong fears before getting answers. and thankfully those fears can be addressed outside of the head where they're made.",
  "send her a apology card in the mail",
  "i would be active in his treatment and make sure he knows to take medicine.",
  "youre welcome good luck and i ll say a pray for you",
  "you are welcome, best of luck with all your studies!",
  "have you been dating other people?",
  "field hockey that sounds like an exciting sport to play! that does sound like it would keep you busy",
  "would you say your problems start with your roommates?",
  "i think that sounds like a great thing! sometimes we just need to get together and help out the people we love going through tough times!",
  "did you need help with anything else?",
  "porn can be helpful for a relationship but it can also be damaging.",
  "yes it's the thought that counts and being blessed to be around love ones",
  "i use some small weights u to keep muscles in tonus.",
  "i am not sure",
  "you too : )",
  "so that is good, that even after the end of your romantic relationship you were still able to maintain a friendship.",
  "thats great, that one small step can really make a big difference. everyones path is different but i hope it really helps you.",
  "that's such a great approach. do you have hobbies and interests outside of your relationship that brought you joy? maybe running, painting, or watching movies?",
  "that's a great idea. i think that you can find something in the shortterm. companies are always looking for capable employees.",
  "speaking to others who have had similar experiences it's always a good idea. they may be able to offer a fresh perspective that you haven't considered before",
  "from what i have found, connection to other people can help your perspective on thingfeelingsetc... so much.",
  "please do your best. that is all i can expect.",
  "i think that is a very nice idea. i also might suggest finding activities that you both could enjoy and spend time together. maybe finding a show you both could enjoy will open up room for a greater connection!",
  "have a good night!",
  "that is good, reading is a good hobby",
  "and yes i have actually had a very similar experience! let me explain",
  "i can tell you from personal experience and seeing others who've gone through similar events, your parents just may be a little upset right now, but they love you and really just want you to have a good and happy life. it sounds cheesy, i know, but it is actually true.",
  "everyone needs help sometimes : ) and you can pass it forward when things are better for you. on that note i suppose i had better go but i was glad to speak with you!",
  "it has been really nice chatting to you and i hope that things go your way in 2021. you seem like good person : )",
  "i am always here for you!",
  "your welcome",
  "i would just say something along the lines of: hey, youre not acting like yourself today, anything you want to talk about?",
  "i can feel your frustration just by our conversation, and i too wish that she could see that you value both her and your friendship enough to reach out to someone that can just listen. don't forget that your feelings are valid as well.",
  "yes please. try calling again and if she is not answering your calls. maybe you can try and meet her or write all your feelings in a mail and send to her.",
  "yes this would also make me feel isolated as well.",
  "yea, and hey maybe when the vaccine is readily available and we can start seeing our family safely again, we can make a new tradition. a new vday celebration heh.",
  "ok be blessed. have a merry christmas",
  "i call my parents around your age ) about once a week.",
  "you're right. it's best to err on the side of caution when it comes to covid. but remember that doug isn't your loved one alone. he's sharing germs with both you and his wife. maybe a lockdown - emotional and physical - will help you work to find an end to this relationship.",
  "merry christmas",
  "of course! that sounds frustrating to not know why it's happening and not have the opportunity to ask.",
  "do you think that you enjoy your current field even though it is not as well paid as it could be?",
  "i understand that. freelance does equal freedom. research opportunities. you sound like a smart man.",
  "merry christmas!",
  "is there anything else on your mind that i can help you with?",
  "if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. i think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help.",
  "just find the right balance between pleasure and responsibility and you will be just fine!",
  "it sounds like it would help if he were direct with you and not sending mixed signals. is that correct?",
  "dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could",
  "im glad i could provide you some support",
  "it's a very hard position to be in, but life is too beautiful to be miserable, and i know you would rather be happy.",
  "that sounds like a fantastic plan, another goal. do you need more advice?",
  "hopefully you can see the light at the end of this tunnel. the second waves seem to be a trend, and we made it through the first one.",
  "yes, of course it is : ). so we are talking about your daughter and her husband and their child together, right?",
  "i think it would definitely help to talk to her about it, it is never good to let situations like this build up without being talked about.",
  "you're under a lot of pressure. it's only natural that you would feel overwhelmed. dont be hard on yourself. you're doing the best you can.",
  "can you make a new one?",
  "i am going to ask you a few questions if ok i don't want to sound like i am prying.",
  "it may be an opportunity to test another kind of work",
  "lack of interest in things is also a symptom of depression. once your depression lifts it will come back. i'll tell you what helped me when i was depresed...",
  "i have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and i understand the added stress that can cause in your household.",
  "i do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. i know that i was",
  "i can understand that. the stress is interfering with your thoughts but you are still doing a good job. you are doing the best you can do; that's the best anyone can do.",
  "i'm sure that if everyone puts in the effort, you will all be successful with your paper. is there anything i can do to help?",
  "does he allow you to have any contact with your children?",
  "no point- what do you mean by that?",
  "no problem at all : ) can you just wait for the fifteen minute mark before pressing quit, thanks and have a great day",
  "having to fill out that spreadsheet motivated me quite a bit at the time.",
  "is grand mother ashamed of you or her daughter? i feel it should be her ashamed of her daughter.",
  "im so glad that i could help you out! you have a great day too!",
  "that's great if you want to move forward and forget about it. you should engage yourself in the activities which you like. it will help you a lot coming out from this situation.",
  "okay yes i agree with you i was also trying to find a new job since i had more time after graduating.",
  "are there any revision courses that you can access to help refresh your skills?",
  "where do you want to take your friends and girlfriend?",
  "what are some disturbances that you deal with currently?",
  "you know there is nothing we can really do right now until all this is over with",
  "have you reached out to others who have been through this situation? it also helps to be able to talk to people who have been through the same things as us.",
  "yes, sorry",
  "it's a rough situation, it will be difficult, you seem very intelligent, have thought about this, are working on a plan and are able to discuss it. that's a big plus on yoru side.",
  "no, i think that should be personal to you, i would not suggest you hurting or making them see you as a disappointment",
  "happy holidays keri. keep your head up!",
  "how about a therapist, if only temporarily?",
  "you too!",
  "that is the only way to know whether you will love or trust someone, the trickiness that is life!",
  "you too! bye",
  "20 years is a long time! it takes a lot of commitment to your friendship to not only keep in touch for that long, but also make the time to support them emotionally when it matters most. you are a loyal friend, and your friend is lucky to have you around!",
  "it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you",
  "what about virtually? i've been quarantined because i live with someone immunocompromised but i try to have phone or video calls with people regularly.",
  "thank you. so happy",
  "i can see how that would be difficult.",
  "please watch the cartoon animals and brene brown on youtube talk about empathy. find one of your friends who has been through the suck and let them help you find your path out.",
  "while your studying play some soft music in the background that you like and see if that helps.",
  "ah i understand. i am sorry about that.",
  "i feel how this is hurting you. the best thing would be to talk to them about feeling disinvited to group activities. let them know you are still free and really want to spend some time together. do you think you can open up to them on whats bothering you?",
  "i feel like she should of let everyone know that before she decided to do that",
  "when you are usually in a last minute crunch, what do you do to get past it?",
  "oh wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating. do you speak to your brother?",
  "hiring might be better here than in vermont",
  "well i hope that helps. thanks for chatting with me",
  "i understand giving presentations is nervewrecking, but at least you are trying. are you allowed to take a few notecards just in case?",
  "even if temporarily this means finding different things to do to get by.",
  "yes, you can and be sure to take some long walks and if there is a beach close by, walk along the beach and think of what that new guy is going to be like, when you meet him",
  "what is your hobbies?",
  "you too!",
  "often times career centers can help you to find job opportunities or perhaps online college could be an option if you want to further your education.",
  "you must express this in some way to let this out. it's not healthy to let your anger bottle up. i'm sure you're angry, rightfully so... do you have any hobbies to occupy your mind until you get things sorted?",
  "i know you need to be with your fiancee during this hard time especially with what is going on with her family. but remember that you have to be strong for her.",
  "i did in fact speak with my friend and it helped our relationship quite a bit. we continue to be very close 20 years later.",
  "what do you think you can do to minimize your contact with her?",
  "hmm, that's a bummer.",
  "a lot of people are really suffering at the moment. it's been such a terrible year but i am hopeful that things will get better in the new year.",
  "have you talked to the professor in the class you are struggling in about ways he can help you learn better? i have found that speaking with my professors when i was struggling and explaining why has helped me in the past.",
  "thank you for sharing with me, and i truly hope that it has helped you even just a little.",
  "what go me through those difficult times was seeking for counselling also i had family that were very supportive and helpful. the father of my child did not pay child support at first so i took him to court eventually and he was forced to start paying child support, so financially things got better.",
  "but you should start to take control over your feelings at first, you are the boss and you give the orders!",
  "i see. i am very sorry about that! it is very difficult when a friend betrays your trust like that.",
  "anytime. im glad i could help. have a wonderful day, and ill be sure to throw you and your daughter in my prayers. best of luck to you and god bless",
  "i feel like that too. it's easy to feel strong\" for holding it in, but it's just as strong to let those feelings out.",
  "i hope that she would not be informed as to where you live though yes, i understand the dilemma. have you spoken with the police?",
  "yeah you can call to local government agencies or any social welfare organizations to help you on this. and i think you will find a solution to your problem..",
  "i'm glad i could help! keep your chin up",
  "i'm in london",
  "do you ahve any siblings?",
  "what makes you anxious about coming home late?",
  "isn't that expensive when compared to your child goodness",
  "did you try any new course. try to do some online courses that help you get new job",
  "yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don't overdo it.",
  "it sounds like you were going through a really difficult time.",
  "yeah, that's a good point. a little complaining is ok, but a lot can get on people's nerves.",

  "very evil, i agree, i like to write out a list of things i can do to distract myself from overly being concerned, if that makes sense. like i take time to think about them and pray for them, then i have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where i want to go and how to get there. even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol",

  "do you have any close friends or family that you can talk to more often?",
  "take care, it will get better.",
  "that's really good, sometimes it is about finding a direction and small steps. often when we are studying the work seems really big, especially essay questions. one thing that helped me was to break it into really small chunks, sometimes physically covering up some of the question. would that be something that would help?",
  "yes i did",
  "i made one starting with the easiest jobs first.",

  "glad i was able to help. sometimes just having someone to bounce things off of makes a big difference. you have a good heart and good intentions. i wish you and your daughter the best.",
  "time heals all wounds. while that doesn't sound helpful now it is true. i also found focusing on the good experiences i had with my father or in this case your best friend ) helps. remembering the times where you both were happy.",
  "that comes down to personal opinion, and is important that we respect each other choices",
  "do you want to talk about what happened?",
  "that is very true. our world has been so different this year",

  "i've basically figured out life only makes sense with god, and i don't worry about a thing now, very little upsets or angers me, it truly isn't worth it. a lot of people have no goals. i think this is actually a good time to examine the year, what you did right, what you didn't do so right, and where you want to go next year. i think self reflection is good for us.",
  "it is easy to get side tracked by ego especially in that field. try to stay focused and remember why you are there. you aren't there to impress jim. you are there to make money and achieve your goals. as long as your eyes stay on the goal, the rest will follow.",
  "anytime, i hope you have a great day as well",
  "is there anything you have wanted to do but don't have the time? i always want to learn guitar and baking. this is the best time to start that",
  "i can understand how you are feeling about that.",
  "money is not always a big deal honey",
  "it's complicated when parents want input into their child's relationships. that is really explosive stuff.",

  "you are very welcome. have a lovely evening, thingscwill getvbetter for you!",
  "how many times have you confronted your boss about it?",
  "clarify, what you think",
  "that sounds like a really great idea! sometimes even little things can make a big difference to us",
  "i would certainly agree with you. that kind of work is unsustainable. let me ask you this. what would happen if you told your employer you simply could not do these hours?",
  "i have traveled states recently and the difference is crazy! i went through tennessee, missippi, and alabama and stopped a few times.. some places are just going on like normal, hardly any masks.. in arkansas you never see anyone indoors without one.",

  "taking steamed shower helps in cold as well. you can try that too. i will pray for her speedy recovery.",
  "she was 2 at the time, so she really didnt know what was going on, yes i do too. it is really a weight off you",
  "what would you like to talk about, then? we could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. what would make you feel better?",
  "so, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating.",
  "i have also faced the same problem before two years but the luck was on my side at that time and not last for long after some months i was asked to leave but now i become normal",
  "this is a worry that many others are having right now. maybe there is an online group that deals in this type of worry.",

  "could it be for a reason you are unaware of",
  "you too",
  "yes it has been a really terrible year for all of us. i am so sorry that this happened to you on top of everything else!",
  "i know you mentioned you want to believe him when he denies it, i guess the important question is what is making you have that shadow of doubt? has he been unfaithful in the past?",
  "ah gotcha. so do you think you will accept or not? or still need time to think about it?",
  "oh sweet me too actually! i definitely recommend heartstone or any game that has a battle mode form",
  "i understand. life is about change. the past can loom large and we need to understand how it affects our perspective on life.",
  "i completely understand that i feel that pain as well.",
  "it has always helped me. for example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals - maybe put call advisor or go stop by every week, but i would put that first for the first week.",
  "thank you! you too!",
  "well, maybe the change of administration in some parts of the world will help a little.",
  "have a nice rest of day : )",
  "has something specific happened that you'd like to talk about?",
  "you too, i hope you feel better",
  "what about having a dinner for some other couples in his unit? have him plan a get together? even drinks and bowling or something",
  "its hard to talk about certain problems, so i can't blame you, however you can get some good ideas from others. you might have just needed some space to evaluate your situation, nothing wrong with taking a break from things or people if it helps you.",
  "yay! a haircut!!! congrats",
  "well... only one way to find that out... and and challenging as it may seem it could be, it's a less drastic step than moving",
  "i can tell that you feel really bad about this just from your tone of voice. please remember that you can't fix everything in the world.",
  "that's great to hear, i'm glad we were able to chat!",
  "do you have mutual friends?",
  "i can feel your anxiety just through this chat conversation.",
  "that is a good idea. i hope that they have not been deliberately stolen.",
  "it seems as if you may have some doubt and may feel unwanted and because of this you feel sad.",
  "it seems like you are doing what you can to stay connected with people. did something happen that lead you to want to reach out for support?",
  "exactly, sometimes we need new window to see things by different ankle. so can i ask you what you want me to do or what is really need you right now?",
  "but i really do hope you get your account back. i'm sorry of how your online friends have treated you and your girlfriend.",
  "i'm around college age as well and also live at home. so i can understand your struggle.",
  "absolutely. i think things will turn around for you. you have a lot going for you and are very intelligent.",
  "they have some experience with other families and maybe could connect you with people who are having similar issues. i've done that in the past.",
  "you're very welcome, i think you are capable of more than you think.",
  "but if you write on medium you can earn money",
  "you get frustrated that other people are achieving something, you are not able to do. is that a fair understanding?",
  "or do you have a common friend that can help arrange a meetup?",
  "i have been browsing job boards every now and then. there are consistently some grocery store jobs, or cashier jobs. if you don't mind the location, i am sure you would be a good fit for these.",
  "it is always hard to find true friends. you must be a strong person and i know you can achieve anything.",
  "my coworker got hers this week. she had a headche, stomach ache and felt weak. maybe do a group chat so they call as see what sympotoms they all had",
  "you are welcome, and good bye.",
  "oh wow that would make things complicated! but yes the deep breathing would definitely help, i'm sure!",
  "with that short of a time, maybe you should ask your friends and go over main points together",
  "it sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. is this correct?",
  "anytime.",
  "have you talked to your friend about what she did?",
  "give her time to cool down",
  "that's great! best wishes for you.",

  "have to talked to anyone in your family about this beside your sister?",
  "so you feel as though life is just passing you by and you are not accomplishing anything during the lockdown?",
  "listen i'm on the same boat as you. it can get depressing. however, i light scented candles, play uplifting music on the background. i learn how to cook and started a new series on a netflix.",
  "i have an even better idea actually two... one talk to your college counselor if they offer that to see a plan of action so to speak and two",
  "i think you should first talk to your partner about your situation and ask for help from them",
  "i do think, and i am not sure how old you are, but infidelity is unfortunately not super rare. i have experienced it myself. i used some resources on even places like reddit surviving infidelity ) to help me process what i had experienced and to also learn from others.",
  "you can and you should get a job, so start right now!",
  "that's an even better idea. great thinking!",
  "you as well!",
  "yeah, covid is an unprecedented time where anything can happen.",
  "oh my goodness. will either of you be able to claim unemployment while you search for new jobs? my brother was recently laid off and he's considering out of state options to hopefully find a job sooner. while that's certainly not an option for everyone, his unemployment is helping to keep his family afloat.",
  "if you feel that he might be able to provide more advice then sure.",
  "like i said the question has arisen more than once. the first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more. since that time, he denies everything.",
  "you should talk to someone you trust, they might be able to give you specific advice regarding your situation",
  "there are online resources to have some fun with friends toomany blogs suggest hosting a group game night or a shared movie night.",
  "i hope i have been able to give you a little perspective on your problems! is there something else you'd like to talk to me about today?",
  "may i ask where you are located?",
  "i just needed to tell you that in case you haven't heard it from anyone today.",
  "here for a while sorry",
  "yes, i would suggest taking up yoga or meditation to lessen the stress covid has on your brain.",
  "it is a difficult time to be making new friends, with all the social distancing policies in place",
  "that's an unfortunate part of most group projects, i hate to say. interpersonal communication can be so hard. i have been a project manager in the past, and found that you have to consider person xyz did not wake up in the morning and decide to make your life harder.",
  "bye.",
  "that sounds like a lot that the two of you have been through. were there other times that your friends was more equally responsive or attuned to you in conversations?",
  "it sounds like you really care about your friend, and want the best for her.",
  "that could be a great distraction. you could start practicing soccer again. you definitely have more time for it now.",
  "you shouldn't have to feel bad in a friendship. friends are supposed to support each other. if you aren't feeling support, maybe it's time to make new friends.",
  "for the time being we're all stuck at home mostly, so maybe take some comfort in that in a strange way. heck i rarely see my friends - maybe once a year, so i know how that feels.",
  "i am sure you will be able to manage all this and it is just temporary feeling you have.",

  "what about getting a nurse, would make him lose his mind?",
  "are you wanting to move back there?",
  "i would make a list of things you have always wanted to do and then just brainstorm any idea, no idea is too out there - learn to ice skate, learn to play the ukulele, sign up for dance lessons, join the gym, go to a singles group at church, visit the elderly, volunteer somewhere.",
  "if you're trying your best to move on and the other party ends up with hateful feelings then i feel like at least you gave it your best right? it might be worth laying low for a little while to sort through the feelings of mistrust and betrayal.",
  "yes, i can imagine that it is. it is always really difficult when children are involved. i know you would not want your children to be hurt",
  "have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things?",
  "no problem!",

  "that sounds difficult, would you like to elaborate on that?",
  "just the mom to a kid with autism. she's had to learn a lot of special skills!",
  "while that is plenty of time to get some studying done: )",
  "indeed, once you free up some time for yourself, i bet you'll start to feel better.",

  "i am a christian also",
  "i can imagine that that must have been traumatic. you will make new friends though.",
  "surely. is there anything else you need help with?",

  "bye",
  "we all need extra money lol but especially you with being a single mom with 3 kids.",
  "has someone told you they suspect he is cheating?",
  "well, i stopped eating my nails after 50 years because of fear of getting sick....",
