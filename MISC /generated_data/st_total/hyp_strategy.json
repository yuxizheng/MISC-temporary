  "no problem.",
  "i think that's a great idea. you can succeed in your exams, but you can also succeed in yours.",

  "yes, i have. it is very difficult to get someone to help you when you feel so alone.",
  "that's horrible, i've been through that too. i know it's hard, but i think you need to do your best to move on and find someone who will be understanding.",
  "it would help you to find ways to get away from him. maybe you can make a schedule for him to take his turns or something.",
  "yes, its a very scary situation. you should not feel guilty about it.",
  "i can't seem to find it. is it a game you play when you are having fun?",
  "are you taking any classes that have a lot of math?",
  "i took a deep breath and took deep breaths. this helped me a lot.",
  "i am doing well, how are things with you? can you tell me what is going on?",
  "yes, i have one. he's a poodle.",
  "yes and i am sure it will be fine.",
  "hi, how are you doing?",
  "i know. i can'; t see it..",
  "just tell them you are doing everything you can to help them and that you have your hands full",
  "no problem! i hope you have some relief from the pandecrisis.",
  "i can't. but i know that they are there to support you.. so if you are feeling safe, you should reach out for support from your family.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. can you tell me more about it?",
  "i've heard of some people who have had their careers ruined.",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. are you a student?",
  "i would try to make yourself happy and then spend time with your friends. if they do want to be around you, it might be a good time to spend time alone.",
  "you can also try the pandemic website",
  "do you think he's just taking advantage of you?",
  "i just kept drinking and going back to my ex. i had to take a few days off and then i just stopped. it was very rough for a few weeks.",
  "i hope you have a great day.",
  "you can try to spend some time on your hobby or something you enjoy doing.",
  "i've been there many times. i have been there once and it was really nice. i can't imagine the stress that would put you in.",
  "i see. so it sounds like you are unhappy with the landlord and not happy with the situation.",
  "hello. how are you doing today?",
  "i would recommend looking online, or even going to a local organization, that may have support groups. there are a lot of free therapy services available.",
  "i like playing games that involve interaction with others via chat. i would recommend playing the game with a friend or family member to build up a bond.",
  "i understand that. i have done some interviews at walmart and it seems like they are hiring. i know they do have online job searching programs for people who are in a similar situation.",
  "exactly. you dont have to be hurt, but if someone wants to change, they need to.",
  "it sounds like you have a lot going on in your life and that is making you anxious.",
  "i understand that it is difficult to deal with parents who don't listen to us when we need to talk. it is really sad to see parents avoiding children.",
  "you can do it!",
  "it's so scary, but i know you can overcome it!",
  "awesome, i hope everything works out for you!",
  "i know things will get better with the right attitude. i hope you feel better soon.",
  "i did not go on the trips alone, however i did go with my friends and family.",
  "what about your relationship did you find that was the problem?",
  "you've got this!",
  "have you tried talking to your friends or family about it?",
  "i've also done woodworking in the past. it is an awesome way to make money, and it shows that you care about your future.",
  "i'm doing okay. what's been happening?",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "maybe you can take a short class in the evening where you can relax and be alone.",
  "have you ever heard of the pandemic?",
  "i know that i have been in situations where i was in a situation that made me feel like i needed to take another job.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. have you tried talking to them about it?",
  "yes you are. i agree.",
  "i know that it can be hard when you have no idea where to go. but i think you are doing the right thing.",
  "i understand how you are coming across.",
  "ah, so you both are close to covid.",
  "i think it would be. it sounds like you have a great plan.",
  "that sounds really hard. i think you should just take some time and think about the things that you could do differently.",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "i think it's a great idea, especially if she lives at home, so you can both feel like you're doing something right.",
  "that sounds like a great plan.",
  "that's a good idea, i know that they have programs that help with this. i would suggest getting your parents to see them on a regular basis to help with your anxiety.",
  "that's great! i hope you find someone who is better. i wish you the very best.",
  "no problem! i hope you are able to stop soon, and that you can quit.",
  "how are you feeling now?",
  "i know. i am going through the same thing. i hope that i can be of help to you and i wish you luck.",
  "i'm doing ok, is there anything you want to talk about?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i can tell you that you are going to be fired because your health is not good enough for them.",
  "i hear you. i used to be the same way. i tried to take a few minutes to breathe and then i was able to talk to my friends.",
  "you already have a plan for how to handle this situation and i'm sure he will be able to handle it. it'll take time to process the situation and let you know how it is going.",
  "i understand that. it seems like you are feeling as though you have to be accept and they are not.",
  "yes, i am still doing the same thing. i find it helps to take some time to breathe and get some fresh air.",
  "i am well, thank you.",
  "i think that'd be a great start. if you want to get more involved in relationships then you should definitely try to get some help with finding a new hobby or activity to help with your social life.",
  "i understand.",
  "well, they might be right but they could also be wrong. they have been trying to help you in ways that would benefit you in the long run.",
  "yes, i think it'll be ok to move on from this",
  "great... i hope i have been able to be of some help.",
  "i apologize for the miscommunication. please try to continue.",
  "i had to sit down with the board and explain the situation to them. the board doesn't have the authority to treat you like this.",
  "it sounds like you have a strong relationship and she'll be able to forgive you, if she is a friend.",
  "you too!",
  "well, you seem to have learned a lot from your experiences. you've already made the right choice. if you'd like to take a step back and focus more on the things you'ves done, you'll get there. you can do it!",
  "i can understand that feeling. i am sure that you will do great.",
  "is it possible that they could possibly stop liking her or would you have to move on?",
  "good luck!",
  "i'd say in the uk, most of the people are evicting themselves.",
  "what do you think?",
  "no problem, you seem like a very thoughtful person. i wish you the best of luck.",
  "i've been in situations like this before, and it's not easy, but just remember that she will either respect or not see that as a problem. it'll only make you feel better if you confront her about it, not her.",
  "i am glad to hear that you are feeling better!",
  "you are welcome.",
  "i am not sure what kind of job you want, but i know there are some places hiring.",
  "i can understand how that can be a challenge.",
  "do you have any other job that you want to go into?",
  "what is making you feel this way?",
  "i am glad i could help. i hope you have a great day!",
  "it's been a wonderful holiday this year. i love it.",
  "oh ok, i see. i was wondering if it was her seeing you chat history or if it is yours.",
  "have you talked to her about her negative interaction?",
  "i have been vaccinated for almost 10 years now. i have had to cut my hair off a few times before i finally got it done.",
  "do you think it is possible to find a new friend?",
  "bye",
  "oh, i see.. i think i had a brain freeze.",
  "it sounds like you are struggling with a lot of things. is that correct?",
  "i do not, i do like to play with friends and family.",
  "ok",
  "oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. is there anything you can do to help with that?",
  "you are very welcome. it was nice talking to you. i hope you have a wonderful day!",
  "that'll be a really big deal. i understand how stressful it must feel to see someone else in a difficult situation.",
  "i understand that. i also have been feeling lonely and lonely. what makes you feel this way?",
  "i understand, my sister and i went through this too. i know how hard it is to have kids and i can understand how you are feeling",
  "i can understand how you feel, i've been through it myself.",
  "i would suggest to seek counseling if you have any at all.",
  "that is really hard. it sounds like you are really trying your best to be kind to yourself.",
  "that's good, it sounds as though you are doing very well on this course.",
  "i'm doing well, thanks for asking. is there anything you would like to talk about?",
  "do you have any ideas of ways to deal without the pressure?",
  "you too!! : )",
  "you are very welcome. i hope things go well for you and your family.",
  "i am so sorry to here that. i can tell from your previous messages that you are feeling extremely down and stressed about this.",

  "it is great that you are starting to look at things from a positive perspective.",
  "it sounds like you are doing the best you can.",
  "i can understand how you feel. have they tried to make plans with you for the holidays?",
  "that's understandable. the world has been on a very bad path lately. i know how anxious and anxious we are at the moment. the only way i can take advantage of the news is to keep my mind off things.",
  "oh i'm so sorry to hear that. i have been in the same situation myself.",
  "if the boss is willing to see you do it, he should be able to see that",
  "i understand your concern. i'm in the same situation as you. i have been through a lot of jobs that were not offered and they are difficult to get.",
  "hello. how are you doing today?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i know how hard it is to be around cancer.",
  "is there any other way you could prepare? maybe with a bit of extra time, and not just for the sake of presentation?",
  "i would suggest talking to someone about this. you may be able too.. it may help to talk about the situation.",
  "hi there, how are you?",
  "i hope you guys can get through this!",
  "i can totally understand how you are feeling. i have been in a similar situation and i can tell that you are not alone.",

  "and don't give up!!!",
  "i'm from michigan : ) how are you?",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "i'm glad that you were able to see why they pulled the excuse. i think that if they want to keep the friendship they should at least try and see if they can be more direct with it",
  "i didn't know that! lol",
  "you are going to see your mom, you need to see her, but i think you have to make time to do some other stuff.",
  "i think that you are good. is there something you need to talk about?",
  "oh i see. i live in the city. i see that you are a male and women are interested in men.",
  "i hope that i have been able to help you.",
  "i would be upset too if my partner cheated on my self.",
  "i see, well it can be hard to make a friendship with someone who does not want to share",
  "it sounds to me that you have a good understanding of the current situation, however, you might be better off without your job. i think that you should take some time to reflect on what you have done and how much you are working towards your future and what you truly want out of life.",
  "when my son asked to play soccer, he told me that he needed to practice to be able too.",
  "i am a woman, i have no idea what the reason for laughing is.",
  "i understand how you feel. i have been in a similar situation before. it is hard to find a new job especially when everyone else is moving at their pace.",
  "oh i am sorry to hear that. did you try talking to them about it?",
  "that's great that you have someone to help you. keep your heart in touch and you'll get there",
  "i know that it can make things a bit harder to reach out for support when it comes to covid, but i think that you can also reach out to people who are similar to you and see if you can figure out a way to communicate to them.",
  "it sounds like you have a good plan.",
  "i know it'll be hard for you to see him again, but you should talk to him about the affair.",
  "i can understand why you would be scared. this is a very unusual situation.",
  "oh wow! i am so sorry to hear that. do you know if your parents are supportive of you playing?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. is there anything specific you'd like to talk about?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what are you feeling overwhelmed by?",
  "that sounds like a great plan! i am glad you are coming to terms with the situation.",
  "do you find yourself feeling upset at times when your grandson is not taking care of himself? do your parents feel the same way?",
  "i understand that. the fact that we lost our jobs and are still struggling shows how much you can do to support yourself during this pandemic.",
  "that is a very difficult situation. do you think you can talk to a hiring manager about this?",
  "i understand how you feel. you are not alone in feeling this way.",
  "thank you, you too!",
  "you are right. it is not worth it. you are worthy of the friendship you have and they are not.",
  "i hope that you find a new partner soon.",
  "you are welcome",
  "you too!",

  "bye!!",
  "it sounds like it would be hard to get help for your anxiety. are there any other ways you can feel comfortable with this?",
  "it's a great way to clear your head and get some fresh air.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "i can understand why that might be. you sound very anxious and depressed.",
  "i can see how that would make you anxious.",
  "if you can't find a different therapist, there are online resources for people in similar situations to you.",
  "oh that's a great idea!!",
  "i think it would be a good idea to try it out. it will make you feel better, and maybe you can find some help from your friends.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "i can understand that. i am in the same situation right now with my teacher and i understand how difficult it is to ask.",
  "i am glad i was able to be of some help! i wish you the best in the future!",
  "hello. how are you?",
  "no problem. i hope you have a good night and feel better",
  "i think you need to give yourself plenty of time. i would suggest talking to someone close to you about your problem and how you can help them get through it.",
  "i didn't have any weddings. i didn ; t have a lot of friends, so i didn t have to go to them. however, i enjoyed spending time with my family.",
  "i would say it's a healthy concern. what are your main concerns?",
  "i think you should try yoga and see if it will help you. i have found that a lot more people can see their own value in yoga than they think, and i am sure that it will if you put the right effort.",
  "bye",
  "i understand how you feel. it can be tough to get motivated.",
  "what is your problem?",
  "oh, that's great. i am glad you are feeling relaxed and relaxed.",

  "i agree with you. i believe in us, we can overcome this.",
  "that's great! what do you think would be a good solution?",
  "maybe he is not, but i think he is just being a little sensitive. i would suggest asking him if he is okay with it, and then explain why it is causing him to be so upset",
  "is it a family thing?",
  "oh ok, so you don'' t feel that you've reached out to anyone yet. is that correct?",
  "well, i would say that you shouldn't press the subject, but you should let him know that it'll be ok to take a step back and that he'll learn a lesson and that it doesn't matter whether he't like the way you look at it or not. it sounds like he has a legitimate concern for your personal life and his job.",
  "you have been with her for 4 months and you still want to go hang with her",
  "of course, and enjoy the rest of your day!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. it must be very difficult to have your whole life tied up in this pandemic",
  "what sort of job do you have?",
  "i am well. what is the issue with you? is it a recent thing or recent?",
  "i can tell that you are trying really hard to help her and that you really believe that you can be the one to help. but if you really can'tworkout with her, you can make her realize how important this is to you.",
  "i am so happy to hear it! i am glad you will be able to talk to a friend and family member.",
  "i used to work in a grocery store when i was younger. i used that as a break to get away from my parents.",

  "ah, okay. so you are looking for a job but not sure what the details are.",
  "i think that is a great idea!",
  "you are welcome. i hope you are able to find a peace between the two situations.",
  "oh i see, so you are frustrated that your coworkers are doing the same thing?",
  "you should do that. i think it would be good for both of your children to have a break from their parents.",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "you're welcome. i wish you the best of luck with everything.",
  "you're welcome, i hope you feel better soon",
  "hello, i am here. i am not feeling well.",

  "i am sure they will be able to help you out",
  "it is normal to feel depressed and depressed at work",
  "hello, how are you doing?",
  "oh that is tough. i know how you feel.",
  "what is your favorite thing to write?",
  "i would definitely make sure you know that you are not putting out fire in the workplace. i would not put the burden of the loss of your job on your coworkers.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "hi, how are you doing today?",
  "it sounds like your business is suffering due to the pandemic.",
  "i understand that it can be stressful for you and your partner at times. however, i think that you have a good sense of the situation and know that you can do your best to keep yourself safe and healthy.",
  "i would suggest taking some classes that are cheap and taking one class every day. it will give you time to prepare.",
  "oh, that's terrible. can you tell me more about it?",
  "ah, i see. so you are feeling as though things aren't going well as expected, then?",

  "you too, have a good day.",
  "i wish you all the best with your new plans and future endeavors.",
  "you too!",
  "well, if you want to talk about it, i'd recommend doing this at least once before going into a mental institution, so that your mental illness will not become an issue.",
  "i think you are doing the best you can!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. it must be really hard. do you have a lot of work to do?",
  "maybe you can start by taking a few minutes a day to relax and think about things that interest you.",
  "oh that's understandable. i'd definitely recommend reaching out to your friends and family. have you tried online dating?",
  "you have a lot going on in your life, i can see that.",
  "hi! how are you doing today?",
  "it seems like you are trying really hard to get through this, but i know you can do it!",

  "you too!",
  "i am glad i was able to help. i hope you feel a little better now.",

  "i think you need to try to find a new job.",
  "it is a very difficult situation to be in, but it is important to recognize the steps that are necessary.",
  "i think you can try to think of things as a couple. there are a lot of people who have been through a similar situation and i know that there are some good times in this pandemic that have made the friendship more meaningful and it doesn't feel like we're in the same place anymore. it is a long time until we can finally reach out to those who want to be friends again, and you can start a new relationship.",
  "if you feel that your mind is being ignored, you can try to meditate, or listen to some music.",
  "it is really sad that you have to deal with this, but i know that you will find peace in time. i have been through the same thing and it was not good at all, but it is never too late to get over the situation.",

  "i am glad to hear that, i know how stressful it can be, but it is worth trying to get a new job. you have already proven yourself worthy.",
  "i would talk to your manager about it and see if you can speak with a professional",
  "do you think that maybe you could try to find a way to reconnect with them? they might be able too.",
  "that is so hard. i know that you are feeling very down. what is your main source of income right now?",
  "you're welcome. i wish you all the best in the future!",
  "avengers end games can be a bit hard. i think we are going to see some good movies in the coming weeks.",
  "yes, that'll be the hardest part. it sounds like you have a lot of faith in yourself and don't give up.",
  "i've been there. sometimes it's so hard to get things off your chest.",
  "it's great that you are feeling better. it'll be nice to have some fresh air and a little rest.",

  "you are welcome",
  "that is understandable. i would like to suggest that you take some deep breaths, take a deep breath, and take a few deep breaths.",
  "i can understand how that feels. it is really hard to feel comfortable enough to reach out for assistance.",

  "wow, that is quite a distance for a hair brainder.",
  "have a wonderful day!",
  "i am glad to be here, i hope the situation gets better for you.",
  "that'swhat i did too.",
  "what did you end the relationship with?",
  "i can understand how frustrating that would be. it is very difficult to move in with someone you don't know and have no idea what to do.",
  "hi there, how are you doing?",
  "you too!",
  "that's a great idea! it's always good to try something new when you're not sure if you've found a way to use it.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "i've been doing that with my family since i was a kid. they love it.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, what is the problem?",
  "that's rough, i'm sorry to hear that. what has been happening?",
  "i can see how that would be frustrating. have you tried talking to him about this issue?",
  "i would suggest talking to him and telling him that you are trying to help him, but he is not there for you. you have the right to do it however you want, but it's a long process, and it'll take time to get over.",
  "you too..",
  "oh i can definitely understand how stressful that can be. i've been in your shoes, and i can tell you know what you are going through. i would be nervous too.",
  "oh that sounds very interesting! how do you feel about the classes?",
  "that sounds like a good plan! i think if they do that they are doing a great job.",
  "i think you're right, it might be a good idea to reach out to friends and family who have been through the same thing",
  "i can tell you are sad because of the breakup but it is okay, i have been there myself.",
  "i would say just start by doing some online classes that you like and try to get into those and see if you can get a good job. it is a tough time to be in engineering but it will pay off.",
  "you may be able to convince him to go back in with you, but you'll have to wait for the next time.",
  "oh i've heard of that. have you tried talking to your doctor?",
  "is there anything else i can help you with today?",
  "what are you struggling with?",
  "you are welcome!",
  "she is a great dog!!! i'm sure she loves the snow.",
  "you don't have to do anything special. just be yourself.",
  "do you have any pets? i have two cats and a dog. i'm not sure if they would understand how much i eat, but i try to stay away from those kinds of things.",
  "i am sure that will be a concern. i also know how stressful that can be.",
  "it sounds like you have a really good head on your shoulders.",
  "i believe you can do it!",
  "i can imagine how stressed you are about this. you have a wonderful daughter and a wonderful husband who loves you. you are a great mom and a great neighbor.",
  "yes, i understand that. it has been a pleasure talking to you!",
  "i understand that you are stressed and anxious.",
  "i am doing well, thank you. what can i help you with today?",
  "yes, i have. but i also had a period of depression for about 10 years before i finally felt better.",
  "you too!",
  "yes it does. it is a very important issue.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. do you have a family member that you can reach out to for advice or suggestions?",
  "i understand that. what are you feeling that you need to do?",
  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "i am so sorry for your loss, the only thing that i can do now is pray for you to be able to go through this together.",
  "i've been in a similar situation. i used to spend all my time trying to get my kids to bed and then the next morning they were awake.",
  "that's really great! what else do you enjoy doing during the spring and summer time?",
  "i went to a therapist. i had been feeling low for about a year.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, what is the problem?",
  "that is really hard to hear. you are right. i am still here. it seems like a very difficult situation to be in. have you considered seeking professional help?",
  "that's the spirit!",
  "what do you mean by treating others better than you?",
  "bye. bye",
  "i see, so you are a roommate, and your boyfriend stepped on you? is that correct?",
  "it is ok to feel uncomfortable with people and want to move",
  "i think we all have goals in our lives. for example, if you can overcome a difficult situation, you can take advantage of the opportunity to make a living and become more successful.",
  "i think that's a really good idea. you can look at yourself in the reflection and feel relief.",
  "i think christmas is the perfect time for that.",
  "have you tried any other ways to lose pounds besides keto dieting?",
  "i have been through a similar situation, and i have also been able to help my family with their finances.",
  "i can relate to that. i used to be in the same situation as you.",
  "that's really scary. i can't imagine the pain and stress that must be going through you.",
  "that'snot good at all, i'd be furious too. i have a lot of neighbors who have dogs and i know it can be hard to take care of them.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "of course! i'm glad i could help!",
  "you too!",
  "have you tried talking to your friends and family about your depression?",
  "yes, i am glad to hear that.",
  "what kind of job are you looking for?",
  "that's understandable. i think that'll be a huge deal for you and others. i know you'll feel much better after you get your way and can see that you're doing great!",
  "i understand how that feels, it happened a long time ago",
  "what do you think might help you feel better about your feelings?",
  "what can you do to help yourself?",
  "oh no, that's so bad! it'll be hard to get into any other hobbyactivities if there aren'ts or activities you enjoy!",
  "i can relate to this. i have a family member who died in 2010. he lived in another country until last year. he still lives in another city. it was so hard to see him, but i believe in you.",
  "so, you feel that you have been given everything you have wanted but it is not working out?",
  "i hope you have a wonderful christmas eve.",
  "i am good.",
  "oh i see. well i think the contract ends in may. that's a good idea to start looking for groups that will offer help for you and your family.",
  "i'm doing well, thank you for asking.",
  "what sort of pet do you want to have?",
  "what kind of software developer are you?",
  "wow! that's awesome! i've also been looking for some good support in my life, i'd love to speak with you about it",
  "i know it'll be tough for you, but if you can keep yourself occupied with your family and friends, it might help you to keep your mind busy.",
  "i think we can get through this, i hope.",
  "what is it that you can't keep up with?",
  "i think that you need to speak to her calmly about the reasons behind your decision. it sounds like you are a very intelligent person and i am sure that she has a lot to offer you and you both deserve better.",
  "do you have a local university or local hospital that has hiring services?",
  "you're very welcome! you need to press quit and take the survey. i will wait for your survey",
  "yes, i had to take medication for anxiety, depression, and anxiety attacks.",
  "is there anyone else who can help you out with this?",
  "how can i help you?",
  "do you have any idea what they are going through?",
  "that sounds like a great goal!",
  "i've been in a similar situation before. i'd love to give you some suggestions about what kind of work i wanted to do.",
  "have you thought about talking to your close friends about how you feel about it? they might be able to help you with a solution.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. would you like to talk about it?",
  "i would suggest looking up support groups for your wife. that way you can be with her and help her out.",
  "do you have any friends or family that you can talk to about this?",
  "i am glad i could be of some help.",
  "have you considered getting a new job? it can be a good opportunity to move on and find a new career path.",
  "you should talk to your boss about it.",
  "that is a great way to look at it. what else do you like to do in your spare time?",
  "i've been there myself, and i found that most employers are open to change their minds about a lot of things.",
  "i believe that it can be, and yes, the process is extremely painful.",
  "hello. how are you?",
  "that's a really tough situation. do you think you will be able to find another job soon?",
  "i am sure you will find people to talk to!",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i know how hard it is to get a job, especially if you are a student.",
  "i am so sorry that you are going through this. i know how frustrating it can be to have a boss that is not willing to accept your offer.",
  "what's going on with your sister?",
  "you as well.",
  "i have had some mental health problems, but not as severe as yours.",
  "why do you feel that way?",
  "have a wonderful day!",
  "i am so sorry to hear that, what are you sad about?",
  "i've got a few minutes left in the morning to do something fun. just let me know if you need any help!",
  "i think you would be more than capable of fighting for yourself. it'd be a great way to get out of that awkward situation.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "just do it",
  "it sounds like you are making a lot of progress at home, and that is a good thing.",
  "you're welcome!",

  "you are very welcome! have a great day!",
  "it's okay to feel like this. it'll take time but you'll find a way to do it.",
  "i see. so you feel that you're being treated poorly because of your efforts, but you'd like to help them in some way?",
  "i think that is a great idea. it would be a great way to connect with people who are similar to you.",
  "i was a big reader and i enjoyed reading and writing.",
  "that is a very positive outlook!",
  "ok. that is a little later than me.",
  "it sounds like you are worried about your cocoworker, but are worried that this is affecting your other cohworker, not your coh- worker. have there been any talks with your covid workers about how you feel about this?",
  "i am doing well, thank you. is there anything that you would like to talk about?",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "i can definitely relate to that. i have been in debt for almost 15 years now and i have found it extremely difficult to take on a large amount of debt.",
  "of course i'm here for you",
  "i am sorry to here that you are feeling that way. what has changed?",
  "i think you all all have a really good idea how this pandemic is going to affect you.",
  "i would be furious if i was in a relationship for that long.",
  "that is rough, i've lost my fair share of jobs too. i'd be willing to bet you have a good one!",
  "i understand that. what would you like to do when you have to leave the country?",
  "that sounds like a good idea. i know you can do this!",
  "i think you're really making the right decision. do you have anyone that you can talk to about this?",
  "yes, it is hard to take the step through a situation that is so difficult to make sense of, but there is a way. i believe you can.",
  "i've been through a similar situation myself and i can tell how you are feeling. i know how you feeling but you can't control it. you need to find the right person.",

  "ah.. that is very frustrating. i would not want to be in a relationship with someone that has such a negative outlook.",
  "i understand you feel like this, but i think it is important to find the truth",
  "why is that?",
  "it sounds like your partner was being toxic. that is a long time to be ghosted. is there anything specific that you would like to talk about?",
  "i think that you can also try to get some exercise that you enjoy doing.",
  "i think that'll be the best solution. it'll take time for them, but they will surely be patient.",
  "i think that would be a great first step. just think about what is going on in your life and then try to talk them out of it.",
  "i'll bet you'll get through this!",
  "have you thought about getting a job?",
  "i am real person, and i have tried to watch some of those things on netflix3. i found that it helped me a lot.",
  "i understand. i love music as well.",
  "you should be proud of yourself for being on good term, even if it takes a while.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what seems to be causing this pandesia?",
  "i'm good, thanks for asking. how may i assist you today?",
  "what are some ways you have been feeling low?",
  "it sounds like you are dealing with a lot of issues in your life.",
  "i know how you feel. i have been in this position myself. i found it really helpful to take a few days to get my mind off things. it helps me to be able to refresh my mind and give myself some time to relax.",
  "you will too. you are a very kind person. you have a very strong heart and god will guide you through all this!",

  "i understand that, and sometimes we just need a little help.",
  "why? what's wrong?",
  "that is a long time, what do you think?",

  "what's going on?",
  "you'll get through this!",
  "well, i am sure if he was not so open with you, you could have made a decision and not let him upset.",
  "i am glad i could help you.",
  "you are a business owner?",
  "i think that's an important step to take. you are not at all alone in this. i can assure you that you are never alone in your decision to marry doug.",
  "oh, i see. do you live in a city or a rural area?",
  "i know that feeling, i had a similar situation a few years ago and i was in a similar position and i did not know what to do.",

  "i understand but it may be worth it for you to get a loan for a certain amount of time.",
  "have you tried talking to him about his past?",
  "there are so many resources out there, i think it will be great to start small.",
  "oh wow, that is so unfair of him. i know that must be really hard for you.",
  "i can understand how you feel.",
  "i've been in a similar situation before. i think a lot of people feel like they are being ignored. it sounds to me like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the amount of people around you. have you thought about seeking some sort of group therapy?",
  "bye",
  "if you need any more help just ask me : ) if you don't mind",
  "have you been looking for another job?",

  "i can totally understand that feeling. it is a really tough time for everyone.",
  "what is your problem with having the stressed?",
  "i see. it sounds like you have a good foundation. that is a valuable skill to have. i would suggest looking into other opportunities as well, such as online teaching, such a plan as teaching online. i know it sounds hard, but it might be a great way to start.",

  "i hope you can overcome this",

  "you too!",
  "i think you will be fine.",

  "so you feel as though you are going to be able to see your partner cheating if he is married? does that sound right?",
  "you are very welcome. i'm happy to help.",
  "what would you like to do for a living?",
  "i am good thank you for asking. what's going on with you? do you have anything going on?",
  "have you tried to talk to them about the situation?",
  "i can totally understand how that feels. i also had a child young and i had to take care of it for years before i could get any kind of support from friends.",
  "that is good, and i know you can do it!",
  "yes, it is. i feel that i have learned a lot about myself through this pandemic.",
  "bye",
  "that's great! and i think you'll do great!",
  "have you been able to figure out which ones are your friends?",
  "that sounds really difficult, and i can tell that you are struggling with the same thing as me.",
  "bye",
  "i can understand how that would be very stressful. i am sure there are other places you could be looking too.",
  "yes, sometimes it is hard to communicate in person. i have had to do this with my parents too. it is difficult when they don t understand why you are not happy.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. can you tell me more about it?",
  "that is a huge situation, it is always hard to find work when unemployment is so low.",
  "it can be, but there is also a lot of research that shows that people who are having a lot more trouble with their mental health can be depressed because of the amount of medication they use.",
  "i understand. i have been in a similar situation, and i have felt the same way. it was so hard to be able to be so close to someone that i could really help, but it was too late.",
  "okay, so you feel that you have not been able to talk about your problems with your friends or family?",
  "i can understand that, we are in a bad place right now.",
  "it'll be great to have someone to talk to in the meantime.",
  "i hear you, i am in the same situation. i had to study a lot to pass my classes, but the first one i did was the one i went to. i didn't realize how much i had failed until the third one came around.",
  "bye",
  "yes, i agree.",
  "have you tried any other hobbies or interests?",
  "i hope that i have been able to help you and your situation. i am sure that you will be successful and happy in life!",
  "i know what you mean. we're not allowed to go outside or use our phones so it can be tough to get out. we have to keep the lights on and have our cellphone to keep us safe.",
  "it'll take some time, but you will get through it.",
  "i would recommend seeking out a new job if you have one.",
  "ah that's a relief! i know how hard it is to get through these times. i have a really hard time getting through these kind of days.",
  "why are you sad?",
  "that's a very difficult situation, i know how hard it is but it will get easier as time goes on.",
  "i would be really scared too. i'm glad i don ; t have friends like her.",
  "i think that you have to take care of yourself first.",
  "i think it would go great!",
  "i am good. how are things with you? is there anything you'd like to talk about today?",
  "i've been having a rough time too. how are you feeling?",
  "i understand that.. i feel the same way.. it feels like i am in a bubble now.. - d",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what has happened?",
  "i am sure you are doing great.",
  "i am sure that there will be some free counsellors available for free online. i myself have found that they have been very helpful.",
  "that is a really tough situation. do you think you could possibly talk to your friends about it?",
  "how is life going for you?",
  "you are welcome!",
  "exactly. you have to see the bright side, and if you do not then you can't see what's going on.",
  "i am not sure.. is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "i had to get out of my comfort zone after a bad relationship. my daughter was pregnant with my husband. she was pregnant and we had to move and it was difficult. but it was worth it.",
  "you are very welcome. i wish you all the best!",
  "that might be a good start.",
  "i can understand how that can be frustrating when you are not sure what to do with your feelings. have you considered talking to a friend or family member?",
  "that's great to hear! how long were you with him?",
  "hi! how are you?",
  "if he is not aware of your feelings, it may be best to let him know that you are angry and not letting him control your life.",
  "so you are unsure what you want to do, and are having a hard time trying to figure out what you can do. what exactly are you looking for in a support group?",
  "what seems to be the cause of your relationship with your partner?",
  "that sounds like a good idea! i think you should be able too. you seem like a nice person.",
  "you're welcome! i hope you have a great day!",
  "hello! how are you?",
  "that must be very hard for both of you.",
  "what have you done to help your depression?",
  "how are you?",
  "i'm sure that would help a lot!",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i think it is important that you are working to make yourself feel better about your situation.",
  "i've definitely had that happen before. it was especially hard when i was in college.",
  "that's tough, it's been a very long time. can you tell me more about what happened?",
  "wow, that must be a really difficult experience to go through.",
  "do you feel that you have to be able to reach out for support when you are unsure about reaching out?",
  "i think that's an excellent idea. it'll help you feel better.",
  "i'm sure you'll be able to manage this!",
  "you too!",
  "two kids.",
  "it sounds like you are feeling down because you lost your job 4 months ago. would you consider getting another job?",
  "have you spoken to your boss about this? sometimes it can be helpful to have someone to talk to.",
  "maybe you need to move on. i'm sure he doesn't want to be around you.",
  "are you a student?",
  "that is unfortunate. i would suggest that you reach out and see if you can make a difference in the situation.",
  "have you been able to work from home since then?",
  "do you think that it could have been a good idea to make a list of all of your exes?",
  "i understand. i lost my aunt in 2010 and she was a wonderful person to me. i don't know if you are able to talk to her about this but i know you are feeling a little better now.",
  "yes, you need to do this, because your self esteem will suffer.",
  "it was a lot of work but i was able to get it done.",
  "how are you doing?",
  "i can tell you are very upset about this and are worried about your financial situation.",
  "i understand that. i used to feel the same way. i would always feel like i was missing someone, but i would just get more distant.",
  "oh, i'm so sorry to hear that. that sounds like a hard time.",
  "hi, how are you?",
  "have you considered any sort of therapy to help with the stress and anxiety?",
  "hi there, how are you today?",
  "it's been on for about 2 years now actually",
  "that'll make you feel very bad and unloved.",
  "do you think it was more than a mistake?",
  "you are very welcome. i hope you can find a way through this.",
  "perhaps she is feeling lonely because she is not getting the same kind of support she has been getting?",
  "there are many online charities that are free to help with the school's support. i have heard of some that are nonprofit.",
  "i see. have you tried using any other forms of online work?",
  "i think that would be a great start! i am glad you have that support system in place.",
  "hello how are you today?",
  "i suggest you try to talk to them through video call. that way they can understand how upset you are.",
  "it sounds like they might not be receptive to your suggestion as well.",
  "i'm glad to hear that. it'd definitely help if you asked a lot of people to see a professional to help you out.",
  "i see. do you have anyone you could talk to about it?",
  "you've got this!",
  "yes she is, i am sure she can help.",
  "what are you struggling with?",
  "i'm so glad to hear that!",
  "you have a wonderful week ahead as well.",
  "i understand how you feel it is very hard",
  "have you talked to her about how she is going about it?",
  "i think that is what you should do. it is a great way to help yourself.",
  "maybe you can take a day or two off of mturking and see how things go, see how you feel, and see what you can do to make the world a better place!",
  "i have one dog and he'll listen to you if you ask him to stop or change room. i usually like to play with my dog and then go to the park to read or watch a movie or something.",
  "i know. i would be happy with a raise in principal but i'm not sure if there is a lockup",
  "i would be willing to bet that there are more opportunities out there for those kinds of jobs.",
  "oh i see. so they are still supposed to be responsible for the money?",
  "i hope that i have been able to help you out.",
  "what are some of your favorites?",
  "i understand that. it must be hard to feel that you are not sure what to do in your next new environment.",
  "i think that is a good idea. sometimes it'll be helpful to talk about things in a way that doesn't make you feel like you have to deal with the emotions. it may be helpful if you know where to start.",
  "you could try doing some hobbies or activities that you both enjoy doing.",
  "i understand that you are feeling a bit of isolation. i also felt the same way when my girlfriend left me.",
  "it sounds like you are feeling isolated due to your friends avoiding your phone calls, which is understandable.",
  "i would be hesitant to say that he has a reason to be manipulative. it is not his fault that you think that.",
  "it sounds to me like you are trying your best to make yourself a better person.",
  "i've heard that the class is very difficult, so there must be a lot of help available.",
  "it'd be great to have a group of people who care about you.",
  "i am very glad to hear that. what kind of work do you do?",
  "are you able to talk to them about how you feel about their marriage?",
  "i understand. what is going on that you are struggling with?",
  "you are very welcome. have a wonderful day.",
  "i believe you can do it!",
  "i know that it's hard to let go of someone you care about.",
  "i would suggest reaching out to family members in your city or town. sometimes people can connect with you through facebook or twitter",
  "exactly, you just have to focus on your self first.",
  "what is going on with you? what is bothering you? is there anything specific you'd like to talk about?",
  "yes, that sounds like a great idea.",
  "if you dont talk to your best friend you can only hurt yourself",
  "i hope you can feel better soon!",
  "that makes sense. how are you feeling about this?",
  "i understand, i would too.",
  "i hear you! i feel the same. i have a son and he is 10 years old.",
  "i know you feel like you have been given everything but i know it is really difficult to see someone else struggling. it is so hard to get help from people you care about.",
  "i've also been in a similar situation before. the only thing that i did was to talk to a close friend and ask him why he was drinking. i think it was because he didn't want to give up alcohol.",
  "i think that you're doing the right thing. i wish you the best of luck!",
  "or you could always take the time to figure out a way to do things differently for yourself. i'm sure there are some online resources that you could use.",
  "oh, i'm so sorry to hear that. i can't imagine what it must be like to be in such a situation. i've been in your shoes before and i know how it feels to have a partner who isn't your own!",
  "it is a great time to start out with something you love and want to try to do.",
  "i am sure you have a great time!",
  "you are welcome! i am glad that you were able to find a new one. you are very welcome.",
  "you're welcome! i hope things turn around for you soon and your girlfriend will be understanding and understanding of this situation.",
  "i'm glad i could help, thank you for talking.",
  "what's been going on?",
  "yeah, mturk is definitely a good way to relax. i also have a great friend who is in a similar situation - she lives with me and has a great family. she's really good with turk as well, and we both do mtturk together.",
  "i think that would be a great way to approach the situation. perhaps you could go out and meet some friends or family members who may be willing to help with some of the work you are currently doing.",
  "do you have any hobbies?",
  "i agree. i think we need to be very careful with taking care of ourselves and let them be. we are not supposed to feel safe in the moment.",
  "it is important to remember you are not alone in this.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what kind of problems are you dealing with?",
  "do you think that maybe it was the covid that gave you the weight gain?",
  "i can relate to that, i have been in a similar situation myself.",
  "have you thought about getting a vacation or something to take your mind off of it?",
  "it is hard, but i know you can do it.",
  "i think it's important to take care of yourself.",
  "i am okay. i am glad to hear you are doing well.",
  "i can tell you are very stressed and anxious about this.",
  "i think it'll be a very useful place to start. it sounds like you're in a really good position to get a job. have you considered looking for a career change?",
  "do you think that you're letting them down?",
  "i think that you should always be prepared. i believe that the best thing you can do is to be patient and decide what to do next.",
  "sometimes, when we fail we think we should do something about it. sometimes, we think that we are supposed to do something to take the edge off.",
  "i know how difficult it is to lose your job but i am sure they would be sympathetic!",
  "i'm glad to hear that, it's been a really rough year!",
  "have a good rest of your day.",
  "i am very sorry for your loss, cancer is not easy, especially if it was a baby.",
  "i'll help you, do you have a birthday party?",
  "i understand. it can be difficult to talk to someone who is in your same situation.",
  "that is a really difficult situation... i would suggest you do a little research online and see if there is a good support group out there. i know that i would help you with things you want to do, not only date, but also to get your own happiness",
  "that is really hard. what do you think you can do to help ease the pain?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what is causing the break up?",
  "it is very hard to recover from covid. i'm in the uk and it is still very cold.",
  "oh i see, so you have a job that is not working right now?",
  "i know you are in a tough spot, but i think you are making the right decision. you are doing the best you can!",
  "ok bye",
  "you too!",
  "i understand. i used to feel the same way. now i set a daily goal and try to do it daily, but it'll take time.",
  "good luck with you maybe so )",

  "so you are feeling like you are in a hurry to leave home?",
  "so you are currently looking for work because you are not being paid enough for your essential bills?",
  "i am glad i was able to help.",
  "is there anything else i can help you with today?",
  "it'll be okay, it'sn't like this all to soon.",
  "i understand that. have you looked into other job postings?",
  "you were doing your best and you had a good plan.",
  "i am glad i got it",
  "i can understand that, as it'm so hard for me to find another job.",
  "i think you can look at things from her perspective, and try to see how she is feeling, and then try to move on from her.",
  "have you tried to reach out to your coworkers about how you are feeling?",
  "you're most welcome! i wish you all the best with everything!",

  "it seems that you have a lot going on in your life and are trying to figure out how to deal with it.",
  "yes, i'm here and you need to be. do not let her stop you from doing that. it is not your place to be shaming or treating others like that. you should be able to do it. if your girlfriend didn't respect your boundaries, then she needs to go away.",
  "if he is interested in you, then it might work.",
  "no i am not. i have never had a supervisor in my life. i am sure that he is going to stop being a problem soon though.",
  "you have to be home for at least 30 minutes during the day. i would suggest waiting for the pandemic to start.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, what is wrong with you? is there something going on in your life that has made you feel this way?",
  "you can go to the local park or local church for a day or two",

  "it sounds like you are not friends with them.",
  "i am happy to hear that you are doing so well! i know that you can do it!",
  "you are right. it seems like it is not possible for everyone. it is a very difficult situation and it seems as though everyone is dealing with the same thing. it'll be nice to have a good support system though.",

  "you are welcome! i hope i've been able to help! i know how hard it can be to get things off your chest, but i am hoping that i can help you and others in the same situation.",
  "i totally understand how you feel. i have been to a few and it took a toll on my body and my mental health. i also found that it helped me to be able to see my own health more easily and i found that even though my mood was normal, i still felt depressed.",
  "bye",
  "that is good. i am sure that you are doing your best to do your best and you will do great!",

  "i understand how anxious you are about that. you have to be prepared.",
  "i think you are going to find that if you tell your boss, he will be more than happy to help. i would also recommend that you let your sister know that you feel that this is a serious problem that you are facing and that you need to be able emotionally to deal with it. i know it sounds frustrating, but it is never easy to be in that situation and know that it is your fault.",
  "that'll work!",
  "i can understand how you feel. i have been through that.",
  "i would try to talk to a close friend and see if they can be helpful",
  "i can see how frustrating that must be. i am sure you will find someone who will listen.",
  "what makes you feel that way?",
  "i am in a similar situation to you, and we were together for 14 minutes. we had a good time talking, but we just got to talk it out with each other. i can tell you that it was very beneficial to us, and i am happy to help you too!",

  "have you thought about any of the things you are looking forward to doing in the near future?",
  "i have been able to find a few other ways to cope with the alcohol, including taking a walk, taking a shower, and going out to a park. i have found that if i have alcohol in my life, i can be more comfortable in public.",

  "i can feel how stressed out you are, i can imagine it is.",
  "i'd love to visit pennsylvania one day, but i'll have to make sure to visit again soon! i can't imagine how much fun it must be.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i had to have a car crash and it was really painful.",
  "you too!",
  "have you tried talking to your doctor about this issue?",
  "i hear you. i am also scared of 19 exposure. i can feel how isolated you are. it'll be okay.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. are you feeling any pain?",
  "thank you, you as well",
