  "i do feel you. it's tough to feel the way that you feel about other people.",
  "it is tough, but the best thing to do is pray for your god, he is always in the path, and if he is not, i would suggest taking it up with him.",

  "i would be very happy if you could come to me and see your resume, but i am not sure if that is too much of you, but if you do not think that is a good idea, if you are going through the process, please ask if you would like me for an interview.",
  "i think i'll suggest a sleep routine for my phone, and it's important to be very busy with it, but i think it'd be good to try and stay in bed on it, after all.",
  "i'm glad i could be of you.",

  "yes, i feel you!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, i think i do not have much information on the meditation you are taking about, but i think you are being very focused on the body.",
  "of course, and enjoy the wonderful rest of the rest with you!",
  "i am glad to hear.",
  "thank you very much. it's a great feeling of the best of you, but i feel like i'm not quite sure how you feel.",
  "i know how that must be. i am sorry that you are feeling.",
  "yes, it is a hard thing to do, but i'm glad that you are doing it!",
  "i do feel like it's a bit of a long walk, but i'm sure that'll be a great part of your life.",
  "it is a good thing you can say that you feel that way, and that is good to hear you are taking care of yourself.",
  "i think that if you feel like you have not done enough work, it's more important to focus on your feelings of happiness and to be yourself, and you're very focused in your thoughts of the task.",
  "oh, i am sorry to hear that. that is quite difficult.",
  "it's nice to see someone else that is like you!",
  "that is very tough! it's important to be able do those things, but you can not be a person that is not feeling as happy and focused on the future.",
  "i am sorry to hear that!",
  "if it's like a small job, it'd be good to go through the schedule, but if it is part time, it can be difficult, if you want to take care of yourself.",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "that's a very long time for my daughter, but if she doesn't want to reach out.. she should want you back.",
  "it's not easy, but you should be thinking about what you are feeling!",
  "you are welcome, if you ever feel that way",
  "i understand that it's very hard to be nervous when you're feeling that way, but it'll be better after you've thought about it and if you can do it, it'd be a good idea to take some time to do it.",
  "yes, it'll be better to find someone. i think it'm one of the things that people need to do. but it't be important to feel positive for us. it're not easy, but it is always nice to want a change of them, especially when they have someone that wants to go through the same road.",
  "i know how difficult it is, but i can tell you, but if you think about the past and the future, it is not easy to let go, but once you do, it's easier to move on with the next person that is coming along.",
  "i'm not sure but if it's your favorite game, it might be something that you like to play.",
  "you too.",
  "i'd look for something in the future, if you're not in the usa, but if you are a us state, there's many companies that have some programs that do this, or if you can choose any other states.",
  "i can say that i think that if i am feeling like he does not know, it is a very important thing. i do think he is going through this.",
  "sure, i'm glad that was so good of you!",
  "i do think that's a good idea to do, but i'm not sure if she is the one who wants to be with you though.",
  "if she is a selfish person, it is not the best to say.",
  "i am glad that they're getting to you. if they are not doing it, i'm sure it will be a very long run of some issues.",
  "yes, i know what you must do, but it is very difficult to be able for us to pay for the bills.",
  "it'd be nice to hear you on this topic.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "i'm very glad you are asking!",
  "yes, it's pretty scary for people to be in your shoes, but i think it is not for us.",
  "yes, it sounds like she is going through a difficult time and is not being very understanding of you.",
  "i agree. it is very hard.",
  "that'sounds like a lot of people are. i hope you feel the same way about your fish.",
  "i have never thought of the idea of making her think you are in the states, but you could be doing the same thing.",
  "i think you could do it!",
  "you as well. i hope you do as well for your future!",
  "i am sorry to hear you are feeling that way, but it sounds like you have a lot of anxiety about these things.",
  "i think that is a good idea, but if they want to see you, it is best to let them know how much of you are.",
  "i've been doing that myself. i know how difficult it must be to be in your shoes, but i know it'll happen soon!",
  "yes, it is a very expensive thing to be upset with the kids.",
  "i am very sorry to hear about you.",
  "i know. it can be quite hard to be focused on the tv.",
  "i'm glad that you have made such a strong decision and am glad to hear that.",
  "i am not sure if you should do anything about it, but you should tell them about your feelings about your issues and if they think that you are making them feel like they are doing them.",
  "i hope you and bye to you and i hope that all goes better for you!",
  "i have been there myself, i do feel like people can be a little confused as it is about the schedule, but i am a bit of a person that is in between.",
  "it's a very nice thing to be in that situation!",
  "i am glad that you have some ideas.",
  "i know it sounds like very long, but i am not sure if it is all very cold but, the amount of snow is very small, but it is going to be a lot of water.",
  "of course!",
  "if you are in the mood for those things, i would suggest taking a few cold showers and taking a cold bath.",
  "yes, it'll be a big thing to be reminded of you.",
  "you are welcome, glad to hear you are feeling happy.",
  "yes, you should be doing more work, but you'll be doing the same thing, but it is difficult for you to be able to be in such a good mood.",
  "i hope you are able to do the same!",
  "yes, he is very stressed about me. it sounds like he wants me to be a part of him, but he's also not doing the same thing.",
  "i hope i've made you feel better. it is very difficult to be in a situation where i'd be feeling like you are not doing the same thing. i'll tell you how i feel about you, but i're sorry for you that you feel.",
  "i know how you feel, i am sorry. i can imagine, and you are very lucky.",
  "that'd be a great idea!",
  "if he doesn't like you, it sounds like he is not doing his part to be around you..",
  "i am sorry that is going through you. i am glad you are doing what you are feeling.",
  "i am glad to hear that. i know that we are going through this.",
  "yes, it's very important to start taking things deep.",
  "it sounds like you have the future, you should be doing it. if you do, that is a great idea.",
  "that sounds like a great idea! i do hope you find out what your feelings are about those who left.",
  "yes, that's a good idea.",
  "that is very difficult to do. i think if you want to make friends, you should ask your friend about the mood.",
  "you are very welcome, i hope that i help you!",
  "i am a person, but i do not have a choice to be a person.",
  "yes, i would be very sorry about that!",
  "if you have a good friend, they could take care of you.",
  "i am glad i could help you.",
  "you too, hope you're doing alright!",
  "you as well!",
  "i am glad to hear you can see me. i am feeling that way, but i am not doing anything about myself.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. do you think that your accident is a big part of your life?",
  "i do understand! i think that if you are having an issue with pandemia, it's just the body.. but, if you have to be aware of it and do not forget to eat food, take care of yourself.",
  "sure, i'm glad to hear. i am glad that you have someone to talk with.",
  "that'd be fun to hear about. i think it's a lot more important to be able to do her for a long time.",
  "i am sorry to hear about the loss. that's very difficult. i am very glad to hear you are feeling that way.",
  "i am sorry about that.",
  "i can see. i am sure that i am on your path, but it is very important for us to focus on the food!",
  "yes, it sounds like that is a tough situation to go through.",
  "i'm sorry to see you do that. i think you're doing very well with all of this. i hope that the court is very important for you.",
  "i would definitely try to do that, if i could be more of a supervisor roll - i am sure that it is not a very easy process!",
  "okay, good luck!",
  "it's very hard to be so angry with someone like you, but, i am glad you are feeling as though you feel, but i know that's the most important thing for you.",
  "it's been a few years but i feel like that is when i have started to focus on my body, which i am glad you are feeling better about it.",
  "i am glad to hear that. i hope you can be able to do it soon.",
  "i know how you feel. if he is feeling the way he feels, he has to be with his friend. it sounds like he wants to talk to you about his feelings, but if he feels like he is not feeling like him, he is going to be the one of the same person.",
  "i think it sounds like she is trying to see that her mind is going through a lot and it is very difficult to be able, but she is very very close to us.",
  "do you have any other suggestions?",
  "i hope you'll be able to make the right decision!",
  "you can talk to a church pastor or pastor to get some help. i am sure that he is able to help you.",
  "i understand. do you have any other pets?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, i am sorry to see you miss her, but i'd be very frustrated to say that.",
  "i wish you the best of luck.",
  "if it is hard, do not worry too much. i am sure that you will be better than those other students and you are doing very well in the class.",
  "it is a difficult day for me, but it is not something that is going on. i have heard of people who are not safe for the virus, and that is a lot of people have it.",
  "i'm sure you will find a great job. i know how difficult it is to find work on the internet, but i know it is not easy to be able to do it.",
  "i think if you have a lot of other people doing some of the things that you feel like you should be doing, that's a good plan to do, but maybe take it out on your kids, though.",
  "i think you should be doing whatever you want to be doing in that situation. it is a very important thing to be there for your boss.",
  "thanks. it sounds like you feel like you are doing it, but i'm not sure if you are.",
  "you should look into your school if you want to be a counselor, and i know you are not feeling very focused on your school, but if you are feeling like you want your own space, i know it is a good idea to do some things, so it is very important to you.",
  "it's not very important to give up on the food, but it'll be a good thing to be aware of the body!",
  "you're very welcome!",
  "i know how difficult it must be to feel, but i have always found it to be very difficult to be alone.",
  "i think that if you can't do it, there'll be someone who is not even interested.",
  "i understand how you feel, it's been a lot of people going through that right now..",
  "thank you!",
  "sure! i think it's very difficult to feel that way with the way it is.",
  "you too!",
  "i would suggest trying to make it easier, if it's easy, it'll be a great thing for you.",
  "i am sure you will be alright. but if you feel like the only one is your boss, if he is not, he's not the one that is taking care of you. i am sorry to hear that you are going through this situation, but if he isn't, it's ok for you to go to the other company, but i am glad that you're feeling more motivated to work with him than him, but there are many people out there who feel the same way.",
  "i would recommend that you do a good amount of practice and if it is in the summer, be able, with your schedule, but if it'll be hard, take it off soon.",
  "you're welcome!",
  "he wants to go through his family.",
  "i think you should be there for yourself in your own life! but i know how difficult it must be.",
  "bye",
  "you are welcome. it's a good thing i was able to help you with the anxiety. it is not easy, but it'll be better soon!",
  "you must be feeling very stressed, i'm glad you are doing what you are feeling!",
  "i have been there myself and it is very difficult, but i think you should talk to your friends.",
  "i do like to think that i am disappointed with my friends and it sounds like they have been feeling like if they are having a nice day.",
  "i'm sorry that happened to you. i've never seen your videos but they can be very interesting, but very stressful and difficult.",
  "i feel you, but i am sure you are not alone in that. i am glad that you are taking care of your son. i would be glad to see you are doing something that you feel like you feel are doing.",
  "it's very important to feel like you are doing the right thing!",
  "you are very welcome, i am glad you are doing that.",
  "it is a place for people to go to meet other people.",
  "i think that's good that you do that, because they are not really close with you, but you should focus on them",
  "that's a good idea, you should think about what your dad has been feeling, and see if he wants to be in a better mood, or just see it is not his body, that'll be the best thing for him.",
  "i am glad to hear you are doing well.",
  "it's ok. i'm glad i could be of you.",
  "i have thought about talking to my doctor, but i have not decided if i'd be able to do it.",
  "sure, i hope i'm of the same kind of assistance!",
  "you should do it, i know it is very hard, but i'm glad you are doing it!",
  "sorry to hear that. it's very hard, but we are in the same situation. i am glad you are feeling as much as i am, and it'll be okay.",
  "i have found a lot of things online. i do it to help myself, but i think it's very important to find a very specific schedule, and if you decide to feel like it'll be easier to look for.",
  "i know. i am sure he is very upset about his behavior, but, if he feels the same way, you should find out if he is doing the right thing and make a good choice.",
  "i am sure that it does!",
  "you as well, but i'm glad to hear that.",
  "i understand how it is. i have seen a lot of movies on this very similar topic, but i wish you all the best and hope you are doing well.",
  "it'll be difficult for you, but you should be very proud of yourself and be happy that your friend is doing such a good thing that he wants to be with you. i am very glad that you are feeling like a good mom, if he is a parent, but i hope that you get to be able to take care of him and take care on him. it is important of him!",
  "that's a great question. if i'm being honest, i think you have to be angry about the loss of that person.",
  "i am glad that you have found a friend for you.",
  "it'll be nice to hear. good luck!",
  "i understand about your situation. it's very stressful. it must be a very tough situation.",
  "i know how hard that must be, but i'm glad you're doing this. : )",
  "i am very glad to hear that, it is important to know that you are feeling the way you are going.",
  "i am glad you are doing it!",
  "i have been thinking about doing that. i know it is hard, but it is very nice to be able to do the things that are being asked.",
  "you as well!",
  "yes, i know that sounds like me, but we have a lot to deal with and i feel you.",
  "i hope you do.",
  "you have a very good point. people do need people like you.",
  "you too!",
  "have you thought about talking to someone about your feelings or other issues?",
  "do you feel like you are doing your own things, or is there anyone else that is doing your job?",
  "it was a very long time. he did not want to talk about his ex, but he does not think that is worth his feelings.",
  "it is very hard to be in a very short time of a relationship. but as soon as she says it, you can be like her. it takes a very long time to be with her, and it's not easy to forget the past.",
  "i have experienced that, but i think it'll be easier if you do it when you feel like yourself.",
  "i'm sorry to see that!",
  "i understand, there is a lot of people who are in your position. it is hard to choose what things they want, though, but if they are not there, it is a good thing to be able to do things that are a part of the world.",
  "i understand. i am in the same boat. i've done it with the family. but i'd be more like to be alone. i do not want to spend it with them or close to them. i want to be with them.",
  "that is a big situation, but i am very sorry to hear that about you",
  "it's a good idea! but i think we will be happier in the long run. it'll be nice to see us back",
  "thank you. i'm glad i could be of the very welcome!",
  "i am sorry for your loss, but i know how difficult it is, so many people do not want to have their dad around.",
  "i am very glad to hear, i hope you do.",
  "sorry to see if i have made you feel like you are doing something wrong.. but i think it is okay for you to do something that you feel as though you are not doing.",
  "i'm very sorry about that. but we are in such a rough situation.",
  "i understand.. but if that's not going to work, it's better to be a happy relationship.",
  "i think that's very difficult to do! i think you need to be happy with her and want to be able to see her like her!",
  "it is very hard for me to judge them, but i think you should try to do what is best for you to do.",
  "i think it'll be better to be able to find that job than to be in a similar situation, but i'm sure you have to make it up with the friends if you have not found out if they are looking for you.",
  "yes, it is difficult to be able, but if you are able to quit eating and eat the food, it sounds like you have the desire to.",
  "i am very glad that i could be of help. have a great day! i hope you, and take care of yourself!",
  "i'm glad to hear you're having such a good doctor.",
  "i'm not sure if there are any other games for you, but it'll be nice to do something like that, but i think i'll do the same.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, but it must be tough for you, i think.",
  "i think that is a good thing to be able to focus on other people and make sure that they know that you are doing what they want and want to be.",
  "oh i know, if you have kids, you should be close to them, but as you get older, they are not doing as well as you feel about them. i hope you do not feel that way about him.",
  "have you considered looking into any other work?",
  "you too, you're welcome",
  "it sounds like you're not the same person but i think i do not want to be though.",
  "i can do that!",
  "you can also do a lot of volunteer work that you can do, if you are not doing it, but it is hard to do it.",
  "you may be a bit upset about your girlfriend but they could be doing something to do with you.",
  "i am glad i could be of some help.",
  "i would say he must be. he is quite close to you, but he is taking the moment to talk to you!",
  "it is a tough situation, but i am glad that you are able to come up with some help.",
  "i understand! i have been there. but it can be hard to do that. but if you decide if you are willing to do it, it'd be important to you.",
  "i hope i can help. i do hope you enjoy your day of the holidays.",
  "i am glad that i could help you. i hope that's very helpful!",
  "i think if you want to be as nice as you are at your work, you could do something that is not important and do not feel like you are doing a bad job.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. it sounds like you are feeling like he is being a very stubborn person.",
  "i am sure that is difficult. sometimes, you are not alone in your friend's actions, but you can do what she says.",
  "it'll be better for us to do it ourselves, but i would recommend to do whatever is for us!",
  "i understand, sometimes there is a lot of anxiety about taking care of cats.",
  "i wish you the best! i know how difficult that must be to feel though.",
  "i can imagine!",
  "you as well, have a great day with your future.",
  "that sounds like a very good idea! it sounds like it's not always possible, but if he wants to go through the situation... it'd be a great way to make a new friend.",
  "if that is not something that you are feeling, it's very important that you talk to your family about it.",
  "of course, and i am glad to share the same thoughts.",
  "i know that, but if i am doing my job, i am not doing my own work.",
  "i'd suggest talking to your friend about what they've been feeling.",
  "that sounds like a very great idea to you. i think i'd do the same, if it is a mini - break of the holidays for myself.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. i know how hard it must be for you.",
  "i am very nervous about going to the usa. i have never seen the mask, but it is definitely a nice thing for us to do. i think that it's important to wear a mask to be with people who are comfortable with us and it'll be easier for us, and we are not to be stuck with people that are not doing that much, but if it does not go to us, it't go to them.",
  "what did he do for you to do something like that?",
  "that'd be nice! i think you should do that!",
  "i do know that you should. it is a lot of hard, but it is worth the loss of your friendship. i know that she is not the same as you, but that is the best thing to do to be patient with you.",
  "i am so sorry to hear you are feeling that way, but i know that it is a very difficult thing to feel that way.",
  "thank you for doing that.",
  "yes, it is very important to do that. it is important to be a very well - balanced writer, but if someone is looking for the writer they can not be able to write.",
  "i would be happy to hear you are considering that!",
  "if he wants to eat more food, it's good that he is doing it.",
  "i hope you do it soon!",
  "that is good to hear!",
  "that's okay, i would suggest talking to your doctor about your thoughts with them if you feel that way.",
  "for two years.",
  "do you have any other job?",
  "i think it's hard to do.",
  "i'm not sure.. but i'd be quite interested.",
  "it's a great idea to look up a website, i know that a lot of people are not on the internet, but it is easy to start thinking of a site, and see if you want to be able to feel like yourself.",
  "that is a good idea. i know it sounds like i have been feeling that way with my friends, but it's a bit difficult for us to be able to feel that way.",
  "yes, i do feel you. i think it's hard to be afraid of a loss of work but it is a great thing.",
  "i'm glad to hear, i hope that helps you.",
  "you too!",
  "i'd encourage you to think of a new job.",
  "i know that it sounds like a lot of time. maybe you feel that way about her.",
  "have a great day!",
  "it's ok. i'm sure i have been there.",
  "i can see how difficult it must be to feel like you do, but if you are feeling that way, then he may be trying to choose his behavior.",
  "that sounds like a good plan, i think. it is very difficult to be with someone who is in the same situation.",
  "yes, it can be quite stressful to play with others but i think you should do it for yourself and take your mind off the feelings and focus of yourself, but it'll help you feel better about yourself, so that's very important to me.",
  "that sounds like a great family!",
  "i understand. it is difficult when people are not very close to their family.",
  "i agree with you. i have had a very long hard day of my life. but, i am happy that she is able to be there!",
  "you too! have a nice day!",
  "i know, i feel you. it'll be a nice, short - term year, but i think it will be quite hard for me to look back in my mind and see if it'd be a good day of the future.",
  "yes, it's a good idea, i think, to be on the top of it before quitting, so i'm glad you feel like you're going through a great season.",
  "yes i do, i know how much of my family, but the same thing can be said for me, and the way i feel.",
  "i hope you do.",
  "oh, i know it'm tough, but i know that you have to be kind of a person, and if you do not, you will be one of us.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, but if you want to feel better in the end, i'd suggest taking a bath.",
  "that sounds like a great idea! do you think you will be able to?",
  "i think if you want to stay in shape, then you can do it. i am sure you would be happier with yourself, and if you are a person who wants to go for a walk.",
  "have you considered talking to your doctor about the medical side of the disease?",
  "i agree, i know that i am not as well of her... but it is nice to see.",
  "i think you are right. it is important for us to be able to do things.",
  "do you have any other things you would like to share with people about you?",
  "it's a long time, but that's one of the few reasons to be happy",
  "i am very sorry to see that. but i understand that it is very difficult, but it is part of you to feel that way.",
  "i am glad to hear that! but i am very tired of the time.",
  "you are welcome, i am sorry to hear that. i know you are feeling like that.",
  "he will eventually, but i am not sure if he is worth the blame.",
  "i am sorry that's difficult. i know that is hard to be scared of your parents and it's a hard time to be in your moms shoes but you can do it!",
  "if you can do it, i am glad that you are able to say.",
  "i do think that is difficult.",
  "do you think i could do anything about it?",
  "that's a lot of followers, i can imagine.",
  "i know how it is! do you think about your feelings?",
  "i have had a lot of people who are not the best at communication.",
  "i am glad to hear! i understand that!",
  "have you thought about any other place that may be affordable?",
  "it sounds like you are on a very good path.",
  "if you feel like your life is going to be better, it can be very important to be able to get the mood back up when you are feeling like yourself.",
  "yes, that is great.. it's very stressful when we are so stressed!",
  "yes, i think it's important to get a good study soon. it'll be nice to have a few more days before you're done with the finals, and it't a great idea to look at the past and think about the future of the course.",
  "that is a very hard thing to do, especially if you are doing this for a short time, but i can imagine that is tough!",
  "it'll be fine.",
  "it'll be hard to judge, but, if you have been in the situation, and he is doing what he feels like to do, then he will be upset about you.",
  "that's great to hear! i hope you feel better soon.",
  "i am glad i can help.",
  "i think it is difficult to do that if you have a job but i'am sure it is very hard, and it is nice to be able to be in your kids life.",
  "thank you!",
  "you should look into his doctor, that'll help him and make sure he is doing well!",
  "yes, you are welcome!",
  "yes, i think it is very important to focus upon the positive thoughts and think of the situation, and be able to make sure that it is a positive one!",
  "yes, i think it's quite difficult but i think that she has a good reason to be so upset, but i can be the one that is trying to think of us.",
  "i am glad you feel that way about yourself. have the same feeling as you are feeling about your mood, but i am sure that is a good thing to feel that you are not doing.",
  "i think you are doing good and it is a good thing. i would suggest doing some things you enjoy.",
  "you're very welcome! if you are doing well on the course, there's nothing wrong with that.",
  "yes, i am sorry, i feel like that is going on.. do you think that you are feeling the way you feel?",
  "do you think that i should talk to her about how she is feeling about the past?",
  "i am glad to hear you are doing what you are feeling, i am sure that you are quite happy that you have such a great attitude, and i hope you are not a very upset with yourself for taking care of yourself!",
  "i wish you the best of luck!",
  "if you want to talk about the bottle?",
  "i know what you must feel.",
  "it'd be hard to feel like you are in the wrong place, but i'd tell you that it is important for you to think about what the company is up with. it'll take a long time to feel that way.",
  "i would be very happy to hear.",
  "i would be very happy to be you, so that's okay for us.",
  "i know it sounds like he took the child but it may be very difficult for you to do.",
  "i understand. i am sure it must be difficult, but i think that if you feel like you have a lot to do with your family, there is a great thing to do. i know that's hard.",
  "if i'm alone, it'd be nice to do it at home. i think.",
  "i can tell you that, but i'd be very nervous about it if it'll be better for us.",
  "i think it is very important to celebrate christmas, but i wish you very much!",
  "you're welcome, but that is very hard for me to do.",
  "i know how many days it takes to reach a point of depression, but it is very important to try and focus your body of stress.",
  "i'm sure there are many people that are looking out for you!",
  "i am glad you can help! it is a big thing for us.",
  "yes, we all feel very welcome. bye.",
  "i get that. i do get that, i feel like you need to be in your corner to talk, i am not the one of anyone who is doing his work, but i am telling you how much of the friend, or maybe because of his attitude and how we are being feeling, that it's very important.",
  "i know, i am going to be very upset, but she could be a good friend of him.",
  "yes, if i'm a good person, i'd say i've done my best. but i'll say, you can't be too quick to take care of yourself.",

  "you too",
  "no problem! i am happy to hear that. it must be difficult for you. i know how hard it is to be able to be here and how much time to talk to you as a woman, but i think you can do it if you want to be in this moment.",
  "i am sorry that you are feeling that way, but it sounds like they do move on after a long time.",
  "i'm a teacher.",
  "i am very glad that you are feeling that way.",
  "i appreciate you! i am glad that i could be of you. i have been very glad to you are doing this.",
  "i know that is hard for some people, but you can do it!",
  "i think it's a good idea, but it is difficult, especially with his anger.",
  "you have to be very proud of your girlfriend. how long have you been in the military?",
  "yes, i've seen my family in other places around the usa, but we are very close, but i'd be worried about that it will be difficult for me to talk to her soon.",
  "it sounds like you're not doing enough of it for yourself, but it's not the best. if you feel the way you feel about her, maybe you should just talk with her.",
  "you have to let them go. i'm sure they will be upset that you do not feel as if you did. but i know that'm not always about them, but that'll be important.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. if i were your kids, we might be wondering if he is doing this. but it'll be hard for us to be with him, but if he has some issues, that are not going to be taking care of our kids. but they will be able to be like you, and want to know that he wants to talk to you about it.",

  "oh, i know how you feel. it sounds like you are feeling the same way.",
  "i know that sounds like a difficult situation, i am very sorry.",
  "i've been there before. i know how hard it must be to be feeling when you're feeling that way, but it'll be okay. it can be hard for you to say, if you'll do it, but you can do it!",
  "i am glad to hear that!",

  "i am a year after graduating at this year. i am going to be in the middle of the test for a week but it is very stressful.",
  "i agree with you! it is very difficult for parents to choose the kids. it must be a very important part of their life and they need to be in a great mood to take care of themselves.",
  "that'd be a tough path to go down if that're not the same thing. but i'm sorry to hear that!",
  "you are welcome!",
  "i am sure that you could be able to do that.",
  "well that'll be hard. it's hard to be alone on the road at the moment. but i know that'd be difficult for us.",
  "yes, it is very stressful, but i think it is easier to do that when it is gone in the end. it would be good for you to work at home if you are feeling like you are not feeling stressed about your mood.",
  "it is very important to focus on your feelings, especially your eyes, and to have some balance of your mind around yourself and see that your mind is going through the head.",
  "if you do not want to give it up, i'm sure that it is not a good idea. i think it will be tough, but if you are feeling as though that, if you don't want to, you should be very positive about your parents.",
  "i feel like it's very important to have someone around, but if i start getting bored with myself, i'm not happy.",
  "that sounds like a good idea. i would think about what you have been thinking about them.",
  "i am glad to hear that. it is a great thing to hear!",
  "i understand how you feel. i hope you have a nice new day!",
  "i understand. it's hard to feel like you do not want to be feeling the way you feel about yourself.",
  "it is important to feel like you can be with someone who has been there for you.",
  "it must be very hard to do it, but it is very important to be in the moment, if you want to make it happen, but you need to take the time to be yourself and not be upset with someone who has not felt that way about you.",
  "i am very glad to hear that! i hope he does not do the thing that he wants to do.",
  "that is a great idea! it is a good idea to try a cup of coffee before bed",
  "it is very good to ask, but please do not be so hard on yourself, he is going through something.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. it sounds like you have to be very busy to feel like you are going through this, but it'll be a long wait, but if you do get in a few months, it will be okay to go through.",
  "of course! it's a very good idea. it'll help us focus on our emotions and in a small way.",
  "if he is looking for work, i think he could do a better job, but it'll take a while to decide if he wants to be in the office.",
  "you are very welcome.",
  "i am glad you are here, have you considered doing a survey?",
  "i do not think that is a good thing. i think you are feeling like you should be in a very deep relationship with him, he may be taking his own life and not be upset when he wants to feel like that, but you are not responsible for him.",
  "i understand that's quite difficult, but it's very important to be able to do that, and it is a great start for you!",
  "i am sorry to see that, i think i know.",
  "that is very very stressful. my mom is a strong person, but she's not quite close with her husband, so she is not good at it. but it'll be difficult to go through the whole thing and get that disease that's coming up.",
  "i am glad that you are feeling very positive about this. it'll be difficult for you to say that, but it'd be better to do things quickly and talk to him about the feelings.",
  "i know that is hard but you will be there, but you are always going to feel like yourself. i've had a lot of things happen, but it's important that i want to be in this relationship with you, but that's what happens.",
  "of course, but if it's not a good day, please be very kind!",
  "that sounds like a good idea!",
  "yes, i am glad you are doing what you feel, it is very important to try and focus on your mind, that's great to be able to be focused.",
  "thank you!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, but i think it is good to take some time to rest after sleeping.",
  "i know how difficult it is to feel, but i hope you find someone who is for you.",
  "i hope the kids do okay, but i would be glad if they are a little more comfortable, so that it is a bit easier to be able to focus on the news and focus on their kids. i am in the midwest, but it is very much a very stressful season.",
  "i agree! i think that some people would be upset, but it'll be a lot of fun for you to be someone who is not doing it, you should be able to be happy and let them be yourself, and not feel like you're doing it!",
  "it's hard to say, but it'll be very difficult for us to be able to talk to you and have a nice chat with you, if you are not doing that.",
  "thank you! i think you are very welcome!",
  "you are very welcome, i hope it goes well for you.",

  "i am glad you are able to offer me the best wishes!",
  "i think it's a good thing that you are feeling depressed, i think. i am glad you are in the mood for me and it is a very important thing for us.",
  "that is a great idea! i do think that if you end things and think that she's lying about her ex, she wants to find out.",
  "if you are feeling tired, if you feel like you are not doing enough... i would suggest talking with them about your health.",
  "you too.",
  "it has been a long time, but i have been seeing his boyfriend and he is very kind of me. he is trying to be like him, which is very important, and we are working on the road. i want to make a better life for him, so i am glad he has taken in his own thoughts, but he may be a bit of himself.",
  "thank you, i'd be very glad if you are able to take your advice.",
  "if you feel lonely, it is a very important thing to be happy. i know that if you have any friends, they are not happy with you, but they are able to be.",
  "i am glad you are having the same feeling, i am sure i could be of a better mood for you if you feel like you are not feeling motivated, so that is a great idea.",
  "i understand. it's very difficult to be alone but it'll be okay. it comes with the end of the years.",
  "have you thought about asking her if she's going to want to see if you are doing something about the situation?",
  "i know how difficult it is, i would suggest taking my mind off my phone! : )",
  "it's not easy to forget to do it, but it'll help us to focus on our thoughts, and keep us focused.",
  "i know how difficult it is for us, but i am sure you will be fine. i hope you are able to find someone you are happy with!",
  "i am so glad that you have a pet.",
  "i am sorry that you all all are struggling, but it's better for us to focus on our study, but the professor may be able to tell us what the class is.",

  "yes i'm sure you are feeling very lonely but if you do not feel like that, i am sorry to hear that.",
  "i hope you have a great rest of the day!",
  "it's not always as easy to have the same idea of a choice but i think it'm important to be able to think of what it is.",
  "i think the best thing to do is not be scared but it is very important to be very careful, if i am feeling like i am having a lot of energy and i can use the mask.",
  "i understand, it'd be a very stressful time, but i am sure you could do the same!",
  "i am glad you are feeling positive about me. i would be very happy if you are able to do something with your work.",
  "it's hard to talk to someone who doesn't feel like themselves.",
  "i think that'll be good for us to do for a while.",
  "if you want to be in a similar situation, it's best to be able to make sure that he is okay with you. i think that you should do the same for him.",
  "i've been there myself, i am in a similar situation. it'll be difficult to do it for you, but you can be very glad of yourself and take care of yourself, if you want to do that.",
  "we do. we are in the same boat. i am very glad you are able to use up your car though.",

  "i do, i am not sure if i would be able to though",
  "you are welcome, i think!",
  "do you have anything else in your life?",
  "if you are feeling too stressed, it is important to write down what you want to do.",

  "you have such a great future!",
  "that's very difficult. i do understand.",
  "i'm sorry to see that you feel that way, i'd be very upset about that. i've been feeling the same way.",
  "that're very nice! i know that if you are not able to do what you think of your family, then it's not good to be so close to them.",
  "i think if you are feeling like you need to do a good job of your grades, then it is fine to reach out and feel like they are not in the best mood for you.",

  "do you think you can ask him why he was doing that?",
  "thank you.",

  "that's alright, bye to you. i hope that you feel better soon.",
  "yes, it sounds like it's difficult but it will be easier for you to be able to do that, and i think it'll be easier if he does it on his own.",
  "i've seen a lot of people who are feeling that way about their family, but they're not always able to take care of themselves, and it'll be tough to think of them. i'd suggest looking for a new career, as i do, but i'll say, if you can't find a new one.",
