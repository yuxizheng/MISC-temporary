  "if you are in an area where you can afford it, you can also try to get a free counselling class if you can.",
  "i understand.",
  "have you tried looking for a new job?",
  "i think that you should tell her that you are trying to help her, and not to pay her money for it.",
  "what do you do for a living?",
  "i can see how you are feeling that you were trying to help them, but it is important to remember that they were there for you. you are an amazing friend and i've been there.",

  "i understand. it's very easy to be alone sometimes. it will be hard to find people to talk to.",

  "that may be a good idea!",
  "i would just sit down and have a serious talk about how you feel",
  "i hope you will find a way through this!",
  "do you think it would be beneficial for you to take some time to relax? or do you not know how to take it?",
  "i hope you have a great day and keep it up!",
