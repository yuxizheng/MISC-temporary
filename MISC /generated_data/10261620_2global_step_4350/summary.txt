EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, I understand how it can feel like our children are always our babies and we want to fix everything for them.

EOS 1 0 11 That's probably correct. He hasn't been in contact with me as much since I left for school. I just expected more.  EOS 1 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it sounds like you're both in kind of a transitional period in life.

EOS 1 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah, I mean it's never easy going through a breakup, but people change as they get older and mature, and they aren't necessarily going to still be compatible the whole time. Also I think it's important to not think of a relationship that peters out as a failed one. Just because it didn't last until one of you died doesn't mean it wasn't a success. I think people put too much emphasis on permanence.  EOS 1 0 15 That's true, it can maybe just be a stepping stone to build other relationships. Thanks for the wisdom.

EOS 1 0 7 I think that's the other thing that these lockdowns are doing; they're sucking the emotional aspects out of activities and pastimes we love. Instead of laughing or jumping with fright in theaters with everyone, we now have to do it with ourselves. Rather than cheering as an audience over a touchdown, it's now a crowd of one.

[contxt]	0 0 11 Sorry to hear that.  EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] Time heals all wounds. While that doesn't sound helpful now it is true. I also found focusing on the good experiences I had with my father (or in this case your best friend) helps. Remembering the times where you both were happy.  EOS 0 0 13 I will try to do that. How can I handle this sleepless nights?  EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That's a tough one. I personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons. Some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed. I have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines. The biggest thing is to not use your bedroom for anything but sleeping; so don't read a book or play on your phone in bed, you have to train your body that when you go to bed it is time to sleep.  EOS 0 0 15 Sounds like stuff I can try out.  EOS 0 0 16 I have a strong attachment to my phone. Will be a tough one to try leaving it off while I try to get some sleep.

EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Is there a specific problem making you depressed, or life in general?  EOS 3 0 7 I'd love to hear them. There is one problem in general i'm having that i seem to have always had because of the Depression. I have an extremely difficult time falling asleep.. and whenever I do manage to fall asleep.. i wake up always feeling like crap. I never feel rested no matter how long i sleep.  EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I have had trouble sleeping in the past and sometimes I still do, usually if it is when I'm nervous about the future.  EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] The number one way I have had to help my depression is to pray and read scripture. I don't know if you are a Christian, but that has helped me a lot. The second way is to have a good friend who will listen, not someone who will TELL me what to do or judge me, but someone who can empathize with me. A good listener is worth her weight in gold.  EOS 3 0 10 I've learned that mines not really an emotional thing. I feel like my sleeping issue causes my depression. Because no matter what- i always feel exhausted.

It was very helpful for a while there  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If I didn't get good rest, then I would definitely feel tired the next day and over time, it would wear me out.

EOS 1 0 4 My friend created a group chat for planning activities and did not include me. She included people who are closer to me than to her. Almost like she is trying to steal my friends.  EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. So when she did this, it gave you the feeling of almost being replaced or abandoned by your own social circle?  EOS 1 0 6 In a way. I was disappointed by the rest of them but mostly angry at her. It almost feels like she wants to be the leader of the group and feels like I am her competition.  EOS 1 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It's definitely frustrating to feel that your support system could possibly become a source of stress and competition anxiety.

EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Ah I hear you - I think that there is a lot of that going around during this pandemic. Did you ever have a problem before?  EOS 3 0 3 No, this all actually started about 3-6 months after the pandemic really hit and things shut down.  EOS 3 1 4 [Others] It has been horrendous hasn't it? Have you been able to at least speak to your doctor, even if you could not see them in person?  EOS 3 0 5 Yes! So horrible! And yeah, I have a therapist I see once every two weeks. Although that only helps so much.  EOS 3 1 6 [Question] It might be time to get some more help? Do you think it is bad enough that you might need inpatient treatment?  EOS 3 0 7 No, I'm not quite that bad off. It's sort of a mix of too many rough things. My wife and I are separating right now, I'm in the middle of a PhD program and living far from home, and covid really made it more challenging. I think it's a bit more circumstantial.  EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] It sounds like you have had a really hard time the last eighteen months.

[contxt]	3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] That sounds like a great start. Self care is vitally important in this difficulty time with COVID and the pandemic. I recommend any little bit of time that you can contribute to yourself, this includes reading, relaxing, meditating, exercise, or just resting. Anything that can help you repair so you are better prepared to help your grandson.  EOS 3 0 11 I will try my best to get more time for myself and try to relax more often that I currently am.  EOS 3 0 12 I am also trying to accept that my medical issues are getting worse and I can not do all that I use to, and that truly frustrates me as well.  EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Do you think the anger you are feeling is directly a result of the situation? Do you feel the anger is manifested from somewhere else? I think it is important to get to the underlying source of the anger and take care of that first and foremost.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] That's concerning, but very understandable. Are you able to financially seek additional help? Sometimes it's just what you need, as hard or embarrassing as that may seem. No one needs to know what you seek, but it is important not to disregard additional help, be it mental health, physical therapy, or just general prevention and detection from a PCP.  EOS 3 0 15 I feel that I am having trouble dealing with the fact that I am not able to do all the things I want to do. It is not an easy thing to lose your abilities when you feel so young but your body says otherwise.  EOS 3 0 16 I was in physical therapy but could not afford it any longer. So instead I purchased my own hot tub to be able to soak in and do some water exercises that may help me.  EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] I think that's a normal way to feel and a frustrating part of growing older. I think focusing on positives and things you enjoy will help keep your mind away from thinking about "what used to be" or "what once was" - finding passions and joys in new things could help revitalize you. Can I help you find new hobbies or passions?

It takes time to work a little each day, then time passes whether you lay on your bed or whether you are in the garden working. If you lay on your bed, you get nothing, if you work a little every day, in time, you reap rewards.

[situation comet blocks (attention top5)]	[xReact] upset  [xReact] hopeless  [xReact] unhappy  [xReact] depressed  [xReact] sad

[contxt]	0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] For me, when I start getting overwhelmed and need to "debrief" my mind, and "declutter" the stresses, I use a notepad. I jot down every detail I can that pops into mind. Every upcoming task, everything that has caused anxiety or similar, and then I prioritize them in an agenda. It seems tedious, however once you get a handle on scheduling, in my personal ex perience, it is easier to hold yourself accountable and slowly work your way through accomplishments, even small tasks, which is encouraging to continue.  EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Sometimes, something as small as an accomplished task can uplift a mood greatly. Especially when listed and checked off to see the progress.  EOS 0 0 9 Thank you. That seems helpful. I tend to make excuses for myself when I feel like this and allow myself to slip in other areas of my life. For example if I am stressed, I tend to eat unhealthy food. Overall its hard to juggle all things I want to do and be at once. I will plan to make a list and check off some small things.  EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] When you visually see your success, I hope it will help like it does for myself. I personally believe that it is a useful tool, depression runs deep and anxiety pushes it over the edge with deadlines. Life and Personal are very complicated situations. As is living, in itself. Small accomplishments, maybe with minor rewards to yourself as you go, boosts confidence and tends to fade out the overwhelming heavy feelings.  EOS 0 0 11 What do you consider to be a minor reward that would be a good tool for me today?  EOS 0 0 12 I have created a list and was able to check one thing off already. This has helped some and I feel a little more relieved.  EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions] A punch card. If you have one handy, a note card/index card. Draw maybe, 15 circles around the edge, and call it "My rewards" In the middle, choose one thing you enjoy, for instance, if you like an ice cream sundae, put that in the middle. For your first task, just jot all that is on your mind down, and also use that as the first task to yourself. Check off one circle, and once you hit 15 get that sundae!  EOS 0 1 14 [Others] Awesome! I am happy to hear that it has already helped a little! 
[reference_response]	awesome! i am happy to hear that it has already helped a little!
[hypothesis_response]	i also find that i like to make my own lists, and try to include smaller tasks as much as possible. i usually have one or more in my bag, so i fill it out with small rewards, and if there is nothing more than that, i fill them with little rewards, like a snack, or a snack.

EOS 1 1 6 [Self-disclosure] That's definitely very upsetting. I know how it feels to have that sense of betrayal from a friend I was close to for many years. However, I was able to discuss the issue I had with my parents and other friends. Do you have anyone else close to you that you can talk to?  EOS 1 0 7 I don't think so, my parents think I was too harsh by deciding to end the friendship, it as if my own family doesn't understand.  EOS 1 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] That can definitely add to frustration. What about your other friends? Do you have anyone who either shares the same opinion as you or does not know your friend that you can talk to?  EOS 1 0 9 My other friend believed that it wasn't too harsh to end the friendship as they know I value honesty but it makes me feel angry that I was being used for so long and constantly lied to.  EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] You have every right to be angry, but the most important thing you can do is find a good support system with your other friend. It will take some time to heal, but I'll tell you a paraphrased version of one of my favorite quotes: "Resentment is like swallowing poison and expecting the other person to die." It's important to find support in your other friends and heal properly.  EOS 1 0 11 I really love that quote, it's absolutely true; I think I will talk to my friend about the situation some more so I can fully get over it.  EOS 1 1 12 [Others] That sounds like a wonderful idea. Is there anything else you would like to discuss?

EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I'm sorry to hear that you haven't had success with routines. I have suffered with sleeplessness due to bad dreams as well.

EOS 1 1 30 [Information] Be prepared that she may end the relationship but getting angry is likely not to change her mind. Getting angry does not improve difficult conversations.

She also told me I need to get tested because her sister told her she and my fiance has been having an affair. I didn't believe her or the whole situation so I confronted my fiance.

Half an hour ago I felt that I had no place left to go and felt defeated.  EOS 2 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] That's really good, sometimes it is about finding a direction and small steps. Often when we are studying the work seems really big, especially essay questions. One thing that helped me was to break it into really small chunks, sometimes physically covering up some of the question. Would that be something that would help?  EOS 2 0 22 I have not really tried it but I ought to. I often feel that I am just overwhelmed. Then I know that I got something wrong for definite and I just want to give up.

I do not know how to redeem myself.  EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] I would recommend speaking with him privately about the issue one on one  EOS 2 0 7 That sounds a lot easier said than done. I was the one who was the most drunk. But I do now know if he knows how drunk we all got since he left after one of us got hit in the face with a golf club and had to take her to the ER. So what if I say too much and apologize for what he does not know.

She was fine Thursday when I last saw her. The sister also told me the doctors said she could die at any moment because she has advance Kidney failure. She also told me I need to get tested because her sister told her she and my fiance has been having an affair. I didn't believe her or the whole situation so I confronted my fiance. I knew he would tell this was all a lie but why was he there and before me? He didn't deny or confirm anything he kept saying he was Sorry.

[contxt]	2 0 5 Yes, specially with the disastrous winter storm I underwent. Makes me nervous if our state decides to shut down to combat the pandemic. I am unsure as to what to do  EOS 2 0 6 I believe its more of a general sense of anxiety. I had to take a 25% pay cut with reduced hours, it was a complete lifestyle change. Not only for myself but for my children  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can definitely understand why that would be difficult. Dealing with uncertainty during the pandemic is extremely difficult, as there are so many unforeseen circumstances.

[contxt]	4 0 7 I have been talking to some people who my friends knows also. They show interest but cannot help me on the issue.  EOS 4 0 8 Surely they will refer to some people. But it will take some time.  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Stay motivated. If one opportunity doesn't get your desired response you may be even closer to finding the right job for you. Keep pushing on and know that if one opportunity doesn't work out a positive attitude will make all the difference. Just because you haven't found one yet doesn't mean you won't.  EOS 4 0 10 Thanks for making confidence. I feel relaxed. I believe this will surely be a chance to find myself and get a better opportunity to be relieved from my previous difficulties. Only GOD should have forced me this way, I believe.  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your faith is healthy and gives you purpose. Similarly you have to believe that the dots will connect in your favor. Maybe you can't connect them looking forward, but looking backwards you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.  EOS 4 0 12 I felt anger over my previous employer since he was not giving any time for me to switch over, at least 2 months.  EOS 4 0 13 Even then he was satisfied till then.  EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] It can be frustrating to focus on your last job, especially if you haven't found a new one yet. Perhaps once you find a new job your disappointment with the last one won't be so disappointing anymore. If the new job is better you wouldn't have found it working the last job.

[contxt]	2 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am very sorry to hear that. Facing pay cuts at work can be a very stressful situation.  EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Are there situations or moments that specifically make you feel like this is going to happen? Or are you just feeling a general sense of anxiety and fear it might happen?  EOS 2 0 5 Yes, specially with the disastrous winter storm I underwent. Makes me nervous if our state decides to shut down to combat the pandemic. I am unsure as to what to do  EOS 2 0 6 I believe its more of a general sense of anxiety. I had to take a 25% pay cut with reduced hours, it was a complete lifestyle change. Not only for myself but for my children  EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can definitely understand why that would be difficult. Dealing with uncertainty during the pandemic is extremely difficult, as there are so many unforeseen circumstances.  EOS 2 1 8 [Self-disclosure] One thing that helps me out in those moments, is to remember that there are things in the world and life that I can control, and others that I can't control.  EOS 2 0 9 Yes, I could not agree with you more. Specially now that I have tapped into my savings and retirement. Never in life did I think I would worry about paying my light bill.  EOS 2 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It seems like the best thing you can do at the moment is try your best to do the best you can at your job. If there will be paycuts, you might not be able to prevent it. But at least you will know that you gave a valiant effort.

EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Life is a journey, and as we walk toward goals in our life, people either join us or bring us down.

EOS 4 0 9 This is so strange and wonderful connecting with a stranger about this! Wow. That's true. I kept trying to get my friends clean and to work on a hobby with me but drugs destroyed my two best friends and killed one of them.  EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Ouch! That sounds hard. I had friends like that too. I had to walk away. Has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him?

[contxt]	3 0 18 Thanks!  EOS 3 1 19 [Question] Anytime! Do you do anything for fun? Any hobbies?  EOS 3 0 20 I read. I also like to play video games or listen to music. Unfortunately most of my time is spent on schoolwork and taking care of other things. But when I do find some time, I usually play a video game or do some reading.  EOS 3 1 21 [Information] What are some of your favorites? That is definitely one of my escapes. It is a very healthy way to cope and find some peace among the chaos.  EOS 3 0 22 For reading, I like to read a variety of genres, like mysteries and self-help books. As for video games, I tend to play anything. Mostly, I've been playing to shut my brain off, so it's games like GTAV or Call of Duty.  EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] Can I make a suggestion? From a fellow psych buff, I recommend any of the Uncharted games or Assassin's Creed games! You will melt into another world and it takes the stress away. Leaving you more energized to deal with real world problems!  EOS 3 0 24 That's a good idea. I actually just downloaded an Assassin's Creed game.  EOS 3 1 25 [Question] Great minds think alike!

[contxt]	3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] I remember a time where learning crisis management that taking a deep breath and meditating in the positive work that you are doing can open up your mind to suggestions from your inner self. Have you ever thought that you superb skills can transmit in your home as well?  EOS 3 0 11 Getting to that mindsight is challenging when the overwhelming feelings of 'failure' loom so heavily. I was seeing a therapist and making great strides, then he informed me that he was moving to a private practice. I cannot afford his sliding scale, and I feel let down. It's just that when one thing starts to go wrong, other things follow. Most of the time I see myself as a positive person that can work through challenging situations, but like you said it's a tough time for everyone  EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So now that you understand that you have a awesome skill and that is being positive, build on this. What building blocks can you write down that has helped you pushed through the fire and keep it some where close to you to always give you piece of mind and reinforce your habits of pushing through the fire.  EOS 3 0 13 Well, I am not one for journaling or anything. I try to stay active. I am about 6 months into remission from stage 4 HL (cancer) and it's been quite the emotional journey there. With that said, the mental and physical overhaul left quite a dent in my overall feelings about myself. I'm just now able to run again and in the past week I ran 2 5k's. To me, this was monumental and made me feel great. I'm also learning how to not overextend myself. I just keep hoping for continued improvement in all areas. The reinforcement is just that I can get through this, these feelings are only temporary.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] I totally understand that you are not for writing things down to keep. Yet, you have gone through a alot of events in your life where other would have given up. The key is transmitting your successes regardless of the situations. COVID is not going anywhere and as a person who has beaten stage 4 cancer, it is scary to be living in these times. You are doing monumental things, never forget that because your feelings and stamina for living will bind everything together. Politics, is the dirtiest and no government can solve and will solve the problems in the world.  EOS 3 0 15 thank you for listening. It helps to sometimes just get it out there.

I have been excelling in my role and went from part time employee with no benefits at 40hrs a week, but since I have a applied for our security team I was denied because I took the full time position and have to wait another 4 months.

EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you applied for the Security Team and was denied because of your full time position with the same company?  EOS 1 0 6 Correct, when I took the position my manager said that I could transfer after six months.

EOS 2 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] the other thing is these common friends might feel a bit awkard too about the situation.

[contxt]	4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love  EOS 4 0 18 That's exactly it. So do you think I should just talk to her and tell her how I feel? The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience.  EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just "kicking her to the curb." Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard  EOS 4 0 20 Yes, I think I need to emphasize the friends element of it and potentially support her to move on. I suppose I'm fearful that it will never end but I'll need to face into that and stay strong, and obviously avoid being intimate as this would really hurt her if I continued to sleep with her. I need to be careful about that I think!  EOS 4 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, I can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it. But I think you are going to be able to do that just fine!

Sometimes, my fear overshadows my want for help. I find it easier to open up to others through writing rather than face to face. Have you considered putting your feelings in writing and opening up to trusted friends and family in this way?  EOS 3 0 9 i have been writing for a while but due to my emotions i have stopped writing like i used to. when i did write i did notice a change in my feelings it became more positive and less depressed. now that i stopped writing its like i went back into depression  EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions] It sounds like writing your feelings down helped you greatly in the past. May I suggest going back to writing and even letting someone you trust read what you have written down to understand how you are feeling?

EOS 1 0 13 I think he will be apologetic. He has always treated me fairly. It is difficult for me to put my anger aside sometimes, which is why I have not said anything yet. I am afraid I will not remain calm and might say something mean to him. That would be terrible.  EOS 1 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are nervous about saying something mean.

[contxt]	3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You're absolutely right that sometimes there is a need for medication. My mother suffers from depression as do I. She has to take Effexor everyday for her condition. I, however went through COUNTLESS combinations and never found a relief as helpful as when I write and talk to people.  EOS 3 0 17 I also went through a lot of different combinations before ending on on Prozac. I think that different things work for different people. I do not find it very easy to talk to people.  EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Have you explored other theraputic avenues to synchronize with the medication?  EOS 3 0 19 No, I am rather way of 'natural' or homeopathic medicine. Are there any kinds that you could recommend?  EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You're doing VERY well talking to me! Had you not said anything, I would have assumed that to be the best choice! But if you're an introvert, then my first suggestion is to journal.  EOS 3 0 21 I do do a lot of that but I would feel too shy to show anyone my journal. Your help has been invaluable though and I do feel more receptive to other forms of treatment now.  EOS 3 1 22 [Question] That way you can reflect on what you've written and possibly learn patterns, triggers, moodswings and other information that would help the problem.

EOS 0 1 4 [Providing Suggestions] Like maybe get your resume cleaned up, cast some lines out for employment now, checked linkdin, worst come to worst, make sure you know how to fill out unemployment for the future.

EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] That is a good idea. I would go over your resume and spruce it up before talking to them on Wednesday to add in anything pertinent that you might have learned or achieved during your time with the company these last two years. Make sure the day you approach them that you're well rested, clean and put together. Google some confidence stances and pay attention to your posture. Even if you're feeling nervous there are ways to hide it and appear confident.  EOS 0 0 7 Wow, that's really good advice. Thanks. I didn't think about updating my resume, and I really should have thought about it.  EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] No problem, I hope it helps.  EOS 0 0 9 Should I talk with my coworker about it? He does not want that job.  EOS 0 1 10 [Others] If you feel that he might be able to provide more advice then sure.  EOS 0 0 11 I just don't want him to think I am trying to weasle my way in.  EOS 0 1 12 [Information] If he isn't interested in the job himself I'm sure he wouldn't see it that way. It is natural for people to try to move up in a company when a job opening appears, especially in these current times. If you don't go for it then someone else will.

[contxt]	3 1 7 [Question] Well I had to sit down and think about why I was stuck and tried to come up with as many options as I could to be unstuck, then i put them in order based on which I thought would work best. It took quite a few of them, but I did finally get unstuck.  EOS 3 0 8 I can try doing that.  EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Every one is different, but it is worth a shot, might help the rut your having, might also give you new ideas that will help you decide on how to not feel like your in a rut anymore. Sometimes just talking to someone can help too, bouncing ideas off of each other can help in some cases.  EOS 3 0 10 True, I have been avoiding most people.  EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Its hard to talk about certain problems, so I can't blame you, however you can get some good ideas from others. You might have just needed some space to evaluate your situation, nothing wrong with taking a break from things or people if it helps you.  EOS 3 0 12 I will try reaching out to my sister tomorrow. maybe she can help.  EOS 3 0 13 I also feel embarrassed that I feel so unhappy.  EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] From chatting with you I can tell you might be ready to start talking and maybe get some help or advice, family is a great start they are typically a great support system. It is okay to feel embarrassed but being unhappy will eat at you, sometimes its good to set our pride aside so that we can figure things out. In my situation of feeling stuck I was ashamed that I sat and let people treat me so badly but it wasn't until I seen it as a problem that I started making my lists and getting advice. Some things we do on our own and some its good to have people to help. I think reaching out to your sister would be worth a try, she might also have different ideas and suggestions you haven' t thought of yet.

I have in the past challenged myself to find five things to be grateful for in the morning and write them down. Whether those things are "I have hot coffee and electricity" or "I won $1000 for free", they will begin to start a small fire of joy.

[contxt]	3 0 15 That's a good question. My state is still one of the ones that's mostly shut-down. Part of my depression surely stems from the fact that all evening/weekend activities ended a year ago as well.  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] True. It might be easier to work at home when you have a chance to get out of the house during your free time.  EOS 3 0 17 That's true. And your suggestion of improving my work space is a good one. I've been working in a modified walk-in closet. I've tried to make it inviting, but there are no windows/etc.... it's kind of a dark cave.  EOS 3 1 18 [Information] Most people didn't plan for the long term because nobody thought that this was a sustainable way to work. By the way, if your company wants you to stay home, then it might help buy the equipment you need to be productive.  EOS 3 0 19 That's a good thought. My computer is set-up on a folding card table. (I tried finding a desk a while back, but there was a huge shortage since everyone suddenly had to buy them for themselves, kids, etc.). I hadn't thought of asking my company to buy me one.

EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those both sound like great ideas! I think starting one, or both, would really make you feel a lot better.

You received lessons from both the past relationships and can take that forward knowing what you wish for and deserve.  EOS 4 0 20 Thank you for letting me talk about this. It is a touchy topic, affairs. My heart was so loved during that time but I always told him that if he needed me to step back, I would. It has been difficult on both of us.  EOS 4 0 21 Being a parent, having the families meshed together, homes, work, etc.... I can understand why he feels he should try again.  EOS 4 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] Sometimes talking about why you are feeling is the best way to find closure. Keep the memories of the love and good times but know that in the end you were destined for something so much more. As adults we try so often to find happiness in others.

[contxt]	1 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I would certainly agree with you. That kind of work is unsustainable. Let me ask you this. What would happen if you told your employer you simply could not do these hours?  EOS 1 0 13 hah - i dunno. im on a team of 2 people - and i guess if i dont do it, the other person has to. or it just doesnt get done, and i dont know what happens?? nothing? LOL.  EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] The worst that could happen is that they fire you. But that doesn't seem too likely as they seem to need you. But I have learned in life that if I don't care for myself, hardly anyone does. We need to be kind to ourselves. Set boundaries.  EOS 1 0 15 agreed - i dont think they would fire me, maybe get reprimanded or more likely a guilt trip as to why I cant do it. Im just not sure what kind of boundaries I set when we have things due, and just literally no time.  EOS 1 1 16 [Information] Setting boundaries can be difficult if you haven't done that a lot. When we think we don't have the ability to say NO, then we feel trapped, worn out, depressed, taken advantage of. People need to know that we reasonably can say no.  EOS 1 0 17 Well, I have to set boundaries, because working till 11pm most nights is not sustainable. and who on earth is going to view, let alone sign a contract at 12am  EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] I think that would be the first step. Determine how many hours you feel you COULD work. Then advise them that is what you will do. Find out what kind of timelines there are, and if you can't do it, don't go beyond your boundaries.

EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. So when she did this, it gave you the feeling of almost being replaced or abandoned by your own social circle?  EOS 1 0 6 In a way. I was disappointed by the rest of them but mostly angry at her. It almost feels like she wants to be the leader of the group and feels like I am her competition.  EOS 1 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It's definitely frustrating to feel that your support system could possibly become a source of stress and competition anxiety. Especially since it's where we're supposed to feel safe and unjudged.  EOS 1 0 8 Exactly. They are supposed to be the people I can go to with my problems. Now I feel like they all had a secret which I wasn't privy to and it made me feel disconnected and untrusting towards them.  EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds that you're a person who really does care about keeping the relationships they've invested in healthy and open.

EOS 3 1 7 [Question] I am so sorry... Do you think a few years from now, after the pain of this situation has gotten easier to handle, you'll be happy with your decision to end the relationship? I know it can be hard to think so far in the future.  EOS 3 0 8 That is a good point because I have no been able to think about the future at all.

EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions] Maybe something you can do is think about all this time in a more positive light. Instead of saying you wasted time, maybe you can think to yourself, "I am so glad that relationship taught me about myself and my standards." Does that sound good?  EOS 3 0 10 I also know that he never wanted kids so I have learned a lot about myself and what I want in life. I can think of myself and what my standards are.

First of all, can I ask if he is just your friend online or if you hangout with him in person too?  EOS 5 0 9 That's correct. He is actually a close friend and I wonder what has changed recently to make him like this. I've known him for over 20 years.  EOS 5 1 10 [Others] Okay I see. From personal experience, the best way to confront someone who likes to do most of their confrontations online, is in person. Since he is so used to almost "hiding" behind a screen, his feelings will be more vulnerable and real if you discuss your concerns in person.  EOS 5 0 11 Actually I've never thought of it like that. Perhaps a couple of us can have a conversation with him in person. Honestly some off his views are disgusting. I think this needs to stop.  EOS 5 1 12 [Information] A suggestion I would make would be to hangout with him in person, and bring up the issues that you and your friends have been seeing. But it's important to not make him feel overwhelmed. Almost like he is being "ganged up on."  EOS 5 0 13 Yes that's good advice, I think we need to be tactful and raise it in the right way.

[contxt]	3 0 11 It makes me feel like he didn't learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he's better than me because he has someone new and I don't. I'm trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won't ever find anyone.  EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions] That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you're doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another.  EOS 3 0 13 Thank you! Exactly. But it is scary. I am guessing from your name that you identify as male (please forgive me if that is incorrect), so you might not understand what it feels like to be an older woman when your ex starts dating someone a lot younger. Men only get better and more desirable with age, not so for women.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] I might not understand that particular aspect, but self worth is still self worth no matter the context. I'd say try not to pay any mind to what he's up to. The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence, but if you just focus on watering your grass (making yourself happy) then you'll have a much more fulfilling life.  EOS 3 0 15 Haha, watering my own grass. That is a good way to put it. Thank you for talking to me for a few minutes.

They are certainly not any reason to be angry with yourself. If I may bring up another cliché: "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."

Really? So yeah. I just want to grieve it and be over with it. I think just talking about it had helped a lot.  EOS 6 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] You must express this in some way to let this out. It's not healthy to let your anger bottle up. I'm sure you're angry, rightfully so... do you have any hobbies to occupy your mind until you get things sorted?

[hypothesis_response]	i can see how that would make you feel upset. it'd be hard to let go of that desire and frustration. i can understand where that would be difficult. but if you have to confront her, i think you're probably best off not telling her. it sounds like she's a controlling, controlling person.

Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health  EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] I also recommend making an educational plan. Although it can seem scary and long to see your goals directly laid out in front of you, it really helps with motivation

[contxt]	4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I'm sorry to hear that you haven't had success with routines. I have suffered with sleeplessness due to bad dreams as well. I find doing yoga with meditative breathing allows me to clear my mind, and sleep better. Do you practice any meditation?  EOS 4 0 9 I have never tried because I'm too anxious to stay still for longer periods of time.  EOS 4 0 10 I mean I have tried but its not easy.  EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Having high anxiety makes it very hard to concentrate on meditation. I take a medication for anxiety that has helped me a lot. Have you talked to your doctor about your anxiety?  EOS 4 0 12 Yeah, they gave me pills for that but it didn't help me.  EOS 4 0 13 I know its hard to help me, I just feel better by talking to someone.  EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm really sorry you weren't able to get relief with medication. I understand that having someone to talk to can be a relief when you feel so anxious.  EOS 4 1 15 [Question] Do you have any close friends or family that you can talk to more often?

[contxt]	2 0 14 I do feel that part of my problem is that I am afraid to really open up about it. You are the first person I have really felt able to talk to.  EOS 2 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I am pleased that you have been able to open up to me, it is the first step towards you finding your path. Do you find it easy to write things down?  EOS 2 0 16 Yes, it is really much more easy to write my problems down than to actually talk to people about them face to face.  EOS 2 1 17 [Providing Suggestions] One suggestion is for you to write down all the reasons that you love microbiology. It can be any format, I love a bubble chart (mind map), it could be in list form or just doodles, would this be something you would find useful?  EOS 2 0 18 Yes, that is a fantastic idea! Maybe I can find a renewed interest in the subject. I hope that I can because I really do not want my time studying to have been wasted.  EOS 2 1 19 [Question] It would be a really good place to start. Then you could be really kind to yourself and take some pressure off. Would you like to talk through some ideas to help with the work itself?  EOS 2 0 20 Yes I really would. I already feel more motivated! Half an hour ago I felt that I had no place left to go and felt defeated.  EOS 2 1 21 [Providing Suggestions] That's really good, sometimes it is about finding a direction and small steps. Often when we are studying the work seems really big, especially essay questions. One thing that helped me was to break it into really small chunks, sometimes physically covering up some of the question. Would that be something that would help?

[contxt]	3 0 6 That's true. everything just feels so out of control  EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] When i feel like everything is out of control, i try to focus on small tasks that i can complete with ease. Maybe you can focus on setting up quarantine room, or getting medication and food to last for those weeks just in case. Worst case out of that is that you have some extra food and medicine.

EOS 0 1 29 [Self-disclosure] Yes, we have a daughter. He spent the first eight years of her life in prison. I gave her the choice as to whether or not she wanted to get to know him. He had plenty of opportunities to speak to her and chose not to call or show up when he was supposed to. The last thing she said about him was, "All he does is lie to me and break promises. I don't want to see him or talk to him anymore."  EOS 0 0 30 And no I haven't thought or going to therapy. I'm not the one who cheated on anyone and this just happened Friday.

I think she ends up spending so long making aide memoires that she then leaves herself so little time to actually study.  EOS 0 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can imagine after having heart surgery as a baby she wants to live life to it's fullest extent and prioritizes making memories over school. Does she ever talk about what her plans are for after high-school? At some point she will have to connect the dots of having to get a job to be able to go out and have fun, and unfortunately doing OK in school comes with that. That or a vocational school to learn a trade (what I personally did).  EOS 0 0 15 What did you do? Her interests are music and photography. Recently she has started a gardening club with the horticulture department at school. She does enjoy her social life well when she has been able to have it. She has had social ups and downs but apart from the epidemic she has been happier than in her earlier years at school. You are right she is becoming an adult and will find her place. At 17 I guess she doesn't have to decide just yet.  EOS 0 0 16 You have certainly made me feel a bit more positive.  EOS 0 1 17 [Others] Sorry for the delay. I am glad you are feeling more positive. I was into cars so I went to vocational school to become an auto mechanic. After a couple years of that I realized I wasn't cut out for physical labor and went to college. But the knowledge from working on cars helped me understand things better at college since I had real world applications I could use it on.  EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Gardening and Horticulture is a great hobby!

EOS 0 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind.

EOS 2 0 18 I am better at expressing my feelings that way.  EOS 2 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I'm better writing things down too.

This makes me really nervous  EOS 2 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like that fear of losing your job has been taking a toll on you.  EOS 2 0 6 It has indeed. I chose an industry that was fairly stable and a company that hadn't done layoffs in a long time but COVID changed all of that.

EOS 0 0 4 Yeah, I'm really nervous about what's happening. Based on who they let go, I think I'll be next because of tenure and experience level.  EOS 0 1 5 [Question] So would it appear that they are laying off the people who have been there the shortest time first?  EOS 0 0 6 Well it's a mix of tenure and department. They also furloughed another 10% of the workforce as well so we're 20% smaller now  EOS 0 1 7 [Question] I know this is a terrible time to be laid off from your job. Do you feel that you have a contingency plan if you are one of those who is laid off?  EOS 0 0 8 No and we are in a worse position. My wife was laid off from her job 3 months ago.

EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure they won't see you as needy or desperate if you've been with the company for 2 years already. Have you initiated the conversation with the board already?  EOS 0 0 5 No. This just happened last week so I am trying to keep all of the balls in the air. I was thinking about talking with them Wednesday this week. They are meeting on Thursday.  EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] That is a good idea. I would go over your resume and spruce it up before talking to them on Wednesday to add in anything pertinent that you might have learned or achieved during your time with the company these last two years. Make sure the day you approach them that you're well rested, clean and put together. Google some confidence stances and pay attention to your posture. Even if you're feeling nervous there are ways to hide it and appear confident.  EOS 0 0 7 Wow, that's really good advice. Thanks.

I feel ashamed of myself but I can't help it  EOS 6 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through.  EOS 6 0 5 Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I'm a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are.  EOS 6 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it  EOS 6 0 7 What happened out of interest when you had the conversation?  EOS 6 1 8 [Others] Ignoring this will NOT help things.

EOS 2 1 23 [Providing Suggestions] If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic.  EOS 2 0 24 Any other advices?  EOS 2 0 25 What else can you advise me on?  EOS 2 0 26 Should I look elsewhere for jobs?  EOS 2 0 27 I will have to try that. Maybe it can help me ease my mind.

[contxt]	0 0 2 I've been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn't go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction.  EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint?  EOS 0 0 4 Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don't have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions.  EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.  EOS 0 0 6 Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products.  EOS 0 0 7 I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract.

It kind of feels like a worthless existence.  EOS 4 0 45 She literally made me stay silent about going to a baby brother's funeral when I was a kid.  EOS 4 1 46 [Reflection of feelings] Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. It sounds like you have someone who cares about you and wants a part of you to exist in another living being. I know you're scared and that's valid, but you have an opportunity to do things differently than what your mom did for you.  EOS 4 0 47 Yeah. I guess that is a better way to think. I don't want to extend that sadness to my own flesh and blood. Especially the person who values me so much.  EOS 4 0 48 The doctors trust she can do it and I know medicine is getting better.

EOS 3 0 12 yeah, i think so. but i can't control my sadness of being betrayed by my loved one  EOS 3 1 13 [Information] It will take time, the best way to let it not control you is by talking about it. You gain control over it that way.  EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Being betrayed by someone you love is one of the biggest heart breaks there is. You have to focus on yourself and healing that wound.  EOS 3 0 15 but how can i get out of it, it does so hurting. we are in a relationship of almost 4 years  EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions] It will not be a quick process that i can heal right now.

EOS 4 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Just think of all of the ways our kids are learning to adapt to different life situations as well. That's worth just as much as their formal education. Your concerns are valid, and hopefully finding another safer school works out and this whole thing is over soon.  EOS 4 0 17 I have been trying to do projects at home I normally wouldn't to try to help everyone fill time. Things like creating websites, art projects, and such. Those skills will help tremendously.  EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] That's a great idea, helping fill time with things to distract is a good way to relieve stress as well.  EOS 4 0 19 So, I guess I'll just keep doing what I can and try to stay away from media and the state's tracking site. I had been doing this, but the announcement for the new tier came from the school!  EOS 4 1 20 [Question] What region are you in?

[contxt]	4 1 6 [Information] It takes time to build friendships and relations. The best way to establish the connection is to find individuals who share similar interests with you.  EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions] There is no harm to approach people and introduce yourself. Find some common interests by asking a few questions. If you like the individuals' personality and if they seem genuine then you can seek a stronger connection.  EOS 4 0 8 I think it's because I like anime. Maybe people hate me for it. You know, they call us "weebs" and make fun of us...  EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Anime you say? I love anime as well! For me, I use the interest of anime to seek groups who are interested in anime as well.  EOS 4 0 10 Do those really exist?
