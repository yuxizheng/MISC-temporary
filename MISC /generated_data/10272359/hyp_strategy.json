  "you are welcome!",
  "i think that is good idea. i hope that i have been able to help you.",
  "bye!",

  "it sounds to me like you are being the one that is frustrated by him.",

  "that sounds like a great way to help you relax.",
  "that is understandable, it is a very difficult time to be in our country.",
  "it sounds like you're doing pretty well with your work, and are taking time to take care of yourself. do you have any hobbies or interests you enjoy?",
  "maybe you should tell her that you feel that you are sad and that you need to take some time to think about your feelings.",
  "i can understand how you are feeling.",
  "that'll definitely help you.",

  "have you spoken to him about it and know how you feel?",
  "what is going on?",

  "i think it'd be a great idea. i know it'll be hard, but if you can get that done, you've got this. it'sn't all about you, but it'l get better.",
  "it's hard to wrap your head around things like that. i have had relationships where i couldn't wrap my mind around things.",
  "i think there are resources out there for you and it's not always easy to find them, but they are definitely worth looking into.",
  "i am glad to hear you are feeling better now!",
  "that'll be a good start. i know that you can do this, as long as you keep trying.",

  "i would suggest you to do that. i know it'll help you. i hope i have helped you in any way.",
  "i'd suggest you do some more research on job searching online and seeing if you can find any job there. i know some companies offer free hours on resume searching, but i'll recommend looking into some of the different options available online.",

  "well, i know that i am not as good at making choices as you are. however, i do know that you can do it.",
  "it sounds like you are feeling sad and sad for no reason at all. is that correct?",
  "i would definitely be interested in chatting with you and your colleagues about it. it's always great to have someone who's willing to listen to our concerns.",
  "yes, it sounds like you are working too hard.",
  "i understand that you are feeling torn. however, i think you have a great point. i also think that you should consider moving out of this house. it's just a matter of time.",
  "are you sure it will be right around the corner?",
  "i'm so sorry. i used to go to gym and it was a lot of fun but now i have a better self esteem and have found i can do it",

  "have you thought of doing some kind of study online? maybe there are some sites that you can check on.",
  "that is so hard. i am sorry you are having trouble sleeping.",
  "i think you should start looking for a new job and see what the options are.",
  "what do you think you'd like to do to get back together? have you thought of doing something else?",
  "that's not a good thing to have to deal with. you should have been able to get through it, though.",

  "i'm not sure, i've never had a real tour with anyone before.",
  "i am sorry to hear that.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. what is going on?",
  "i think it does. it can also help to relax by exercising. it really helps to relieve stress.",

  "you are very welcome, i hope you have a wonderful year!",
  "oh that's very stressful. is there anything you can do to help with that?",
  "i am sure it does. covidid1919 is a website that is a bit more expensive than the other website.",

  "that is absolutely great that your kids are taking care of themselves.",
  "you can always talk to them about your feelings and feelings. sometimes it helps to talk about your emotions and feelings to them.",

  "yes, i am. it will be a very fun time. and i'd recommend not getting a phone number, or getting a video call if you can.",
  "maybe you could try to take a break and get a break if you feel like you have done nothing wrong.",
  "how are you?",
  "do you have any friends who are able to help you? if not, you could meet some people who would be able to lend you advice.",
  "i understand how you are feeling. i also feel that there is a lot of negativity and negative posts that can be overwhelming. maybe you could try to find something new to be a part of?",

  "i think it would be best to speak to her directly. it sounds like she'd be able to handle that, so i think you're definitely not alone in feeling like this.",
  "i can completely understand how you are feeling, and i can see how difficult that would be. it'd be a lot of work for you, but you could always try to talk to your friend about the negative feelings, and perhaps try to see how she feels about you talking to her.",

  "i have tried a lot of different types of apps but i find i like the ones that are more focused on my personal life.",
  "you are a very creative person. i think you will find something you love to do.",
  "i understand how you feel. have you tried reaching out to his family and tell them how you are feeling?",

  "you too : ) )",
  "i don't see any details but i can see them and i am sure they are there.",

  "hi, how are you doing today?",
  "hi. i am here.",

  "it's a term used by people who are in relationships. it means you can talk to someone, and that's good.",
  "i can relate to that, i am in school too. the school i go to is a lot more private than home.",
  "yes, i can see that you have not been in a class in a while. is there anything else that you would like to talk about?",

  "yes, but it'll be alright.",

  "that's exactly how i feel about it. i've been working for the past few years and have been in the position to be successful, but when i'd go through these situations, i always knew i could do it. it sounds like you have a lot to work on, and i know it sounds hard, but you're doing your best to do it, and you've got this!",
  "you will find someone soon. i am sure you will.",
  "well i would suggest looking into how they are handling it. they might be acting out in the same way that they are acting out to get into touch with you and they may be more aware of that. maybe they could also be aware that you have a friend that is acting out, and maybe you could find some sort of support system that will help you get through this.",
  "i'd be too. i understand that it's difficult to deal when you lose someone close, especially when it'll take so long.",

  "i have been in a similar situation before, but i found that staying home and doing things that i love helped me through a lot of the stress of the situation.",

  "are you doing any exercise?",
  "no, there is no lock down. i think everyone fears when they see a new lock up.",
  "i have a resume and i have been working on getting a new one",
  "i am sure it will get better soon.",
  "do you have any other friends that you can talk to about this?",
  "do you feel like you could find a new job if you tried?",

  "i think you'll find that you are right. you need to find someone who will listen and support you.",

  "so you feel that you can'get back into working and getting laid off?",
  "oh no, that is a terrible thing to happen. have you talked to him about it?",
  "it sounds to me like you are seeking help by reaching out with them. do your friends know of this?",

  "it's good to hear that. i've been through similar things myself.",
  "i would try to make sure he has the time to talk to you.",
  "i can imagine you are feeling that way. is there anything else you would like to talk about?",

  "oh no! i know how hard it must be to move around, but it is better than nothing. do you have any other friends or family that you could reach out to for advice?",
  "hello! how are you doing today?",
  "i understand. you're feeling exhausted and are worried that you will have to take up the task of paying bills for a while. i can tell from your response that you've really had a rough year with your finances.",

  "i've had some similar feelings before. the first time i saw my ex was after a divorce and i was still upset about it.",

  "yes, i'd like to be able to do that. i'll try to reach out to you sometime.",
  "it's a real problem! i can only imagine how bad it must be to be sick like that!",

  "i am sorry to hear that, what are you looking for?",
  "i think that would be a great idea. i would be interested to hear what your college is like.",

  "that'll be a great idea. you're absolutely right. i think that it'll work out for you.",
  "i think i would go with something that is more realistic, and not have to deal with it for a bit. i have had some friends who have had to go through that.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it more?",
  "that's a great idea.. there are free counsells at my school..",

  "i have been in a similar situation and i have found that sometimes we need to be more motivated and patient.",
  "i understand how you feel. do you have any other ideas?",
  "thank you for sharing! i am glad i could help.",
  "you have to try and let it take you by surprise. it can be overwhelming to feel like you have failed.",

  "i know that is a long time ago!",
  "it is nice talking to you.",
  "i've had a friend who lost her cancer and it was very difficult to deal with.",

  "my uncle has been in this situation as well. i can relate to your situation and i hope he can help you through it.",
  "what do you mean you have been dating for so long?",
  "i understand. it is difficult at times, but i've found that if i let myself get out of the funk, i find that i really enjoy myself.",
  "i understand how you are feeling, especially since you broke up. i am sorry to hear that, how did you end the relationship?",
  "i'm in the south and it has been hard for me to find a job. i've been in a lot of different jobs and i'd prefer to not work in a place with covid.",
  "what kind of work are you looking for?",
  "i think it is a good idea to take some time to rethink things and see how you can get by.",
  "bye",
  "thank you!",
  "i can understand that. i also have a habit like that, and it helps to build up the habit. it'll make you feel better when you feel good!",
  "you too!",
  "it sounds like you are being very difficult for your boss. have the covid hr tried to help you get a grieve?",

  "i am sorry, i am not angry. i am happy to hear that you are feeling better.",
  "i am sure he will be able to help you soon",
  "it sounds like you are doing a great job. i would say that your relationship with your boyfriend was very strong and you deserve better. i think you are a good person and you will do great again.",
  "it might be beneficial, but i think that that it might not be. i think you need to take the time to make sure that the other person is comfortable and that you aren't making any false claims that they are ignoring you.",
  "i am glad to hear you are feeling better and that i am able to help you. please be patient with me.",
  "yes, i feel you. i also feel like i have lost my faith in myself and am starting to feel like this. it's hard to do.",
  "oh i see, so you're struggling financially with this?",
  "you are welcome, i wish you the best.",
  "i would definitely consider seeing a doctor if it is a serious problem for her, and if it'll improve her health in the long run.",
  "you could get a job at burger hut or other grocery stores that would provide free meals",
  "i've been there too. i was in a similar situation, but i found a good job. i went to a local community college and they were able to give me some extra money and help me get my degree.",
  "you sound like you are doing a great job and that is a great start. it's hard to look at our past when we were struggling with depression. i think we should move on from this and move on to other things.",
  "ok, so you're saying you are scared of the pandemics of the job market?",
  "i'm really sorry to hear that. what exactly is your problem with your income?",
  "that'd be a great start. you could try to find some new friends or a new hobby or something. i think you could start with just one person, and then move on from there.",
  "i can totally understand that. it'll be hard to get out there when you're not getting what you want.",
  "you are welcome! good luck!",
  "do you have any friends around who could help you get through this?",
  "do you think that perhaps that is why you feel a bit bad when you see your mom?",
  "how are you doing today?",
  "i understand that. do you have any other hobbies or goals in mind?",
  "i think you should take a break and then go back to school, even if you are in college. you could get a break, and then you can move on to a better place and hopefully be able too. you can get your degree in psychology, and i think that would be a great place to start.",
  "my day is not boring. it's good to be happy.",
  "you are welcome, bye. it was nice talking to you!",
  "you're welcome. i hope that i can help!",
  "i do not know, i was just looking into it. there are several different ways to learn skills.",
  "what kind of help do you need?",
  "oh, that's very hard. have you tried to talk to them about it?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. is it possible you could find a way to get back in contact with your loved ones?",
  "i am so sorry. i know how hard that is. i used to be in a similar situation. i had some serious issues with my health, and i was able to find out that it was the result of stress and a combination of other things. i was so happy that i was not in a headspace to deal with it.",
  "oh my god. i am so sorry to here about that... i hope i am not the only one who has been hurt.",
  "yes, playing hard will work",
  "i don't think so. what do i do? i just try to be honest with them. i do not want to be the bad guy that they keep trying to treat me like.",
  "i think i know someone who is from harry house and is a member of house\" \". he is also a man.",
  "what's going on?",
  "i hope you find something soon",
  "i would suggest doing things to help you feel better",
  "i believe that you will find some relief in this. the world is getting better and we need to move on.",
  "yes, it sounds like you are going through the same thing as me.",
  "i'll be honest, i've been in the same situation. i just found myself focusing on my job.",
  "it is very understandable. i am sure your parents would be frustrated as well. it is a difficult situation to get through.",
  "do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy doing? i know there are a lot of online activities that are relaxing, but there are also online activities which you could take time for.",
  "have you considered joining a group of people who have never gone on a hike before?",
  "you too!",
  "i think that's a very good thing.",
  "it must be hard when someone ignoring you.",
  "i have found that when i am away from my husband, it helps to find something to do to keep me busy.",
  "that's a tough place to be in. i know that you are in a good place though. the world has a lot to offer, but there's no way to be stuck in this mess.",
  "what is the problem?",
  "i can tell you are very frustrated by this and your frustration.",
  "that is a great area to be in!",
  "how are you feeling about this?",
  "i understand that. i would like to suggest that you take some time to think about what you are doing and how you are feeling.",
  "i am sure that you have a good reason to feel this way.",
  "oh goodness, i am so sorry you are having to deal with this. it is not something to be ashamed of.",
  "you're very welcome. i know how difficult it is to find a new job. i think it will take a lot of work to get back on your feet.",
  "it is a tough situation, but it will be worth it.",
  "i understand that people don't understand and that is a very difficult situation to be in.",
  "i completely understand the slippery slope, i have had to deal with it myself before. but, i can understand why it can be hard. i also understand that there are some things that might help you out, such as meditation, reading, and talking to a doctor.",
  "maybe you can ask your landlord if he will let you move in with him and see if he can give you a lease.",
  "it sounds like you are a good worker and have your mind of things, but your boss is the one who is making the situation difficult.",
  "so you are saying that you are worried about your husband and his sickness?",
  "i'm glad that i could help.",
  "i understand. i also had a hard time with my kids being in school.",
  "i would definitely try to stay safe and stay positive.",
  "i'd have to agree with you, you should ask her why she left you.",
  "hi, how are you?",
  "hi there, how are you doing?",
  "of course!",
  "have you tried any other kinds of therapy?",
  "i hope you have a great day too.",
  "sometimes you need to just take some deep breaths and see if there is anything else going on.",
  "it sounds to me like you were attracted to him because of the way he was acting.",
  "yes, it can. i feel that it is normal to be afraid to ask about things, and it is good that you are doing that.",
  "what are you going to do now?",
  "you should not feel ashamed at all. you are doing great",
  "i had to work with people who were in similar situations. i felt like i was being watched by everyone.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. it sounds as though you are frustrated with your partner and have a hard time managing his schedule. is there anything that you can do to help with that?",
  "i have tried to find a good therapist that i could help with my anxiety and it was very helpful.",
  "what is causing you to feel that way?",
  "i know it'll be hard, but you can do it!",
  "you are welcome.",
  "yes, i have been doing that myself and it helps.",
  "it sounds like you're really struggling with the school work. is that correct?",
  "it's probably better to be clear of things now. i think you're going to feel a lot better after that.",
  "i would be worried too, but there is always a way to overcome the fear of losing your job. there are programs out there that could help with that.",
  "it sounds as though your sister has already decided to quit your job. is that right?",
  "i have found that listening to some music can help me retune my thoughts to music.",
  "have you spoken to him about it?",
  "that sounds like a good idea. i would say you need to make it clear to them that you do not want to have a conversation with them.",
  "i see, that must be really hard. is there anything else you would like to talk about?",
  "i think you should declute your house.",
  "i think you could take a walk and do some yoga, and try to meditate, maybe take a deep breath, and see if you can feel better.",
  "i can understand that. i was just reading a book that was about covidsessions and how they can be a lot of fun.",
  "i completely understand. i have been in that position.",
  "you're welcome!",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. it must be very difficult. is there anything that's bothering you?",
  "it sounds like you have a lot going on in your life, so i would definitely consider getting a lawyer involved.",
  "i can understand that feeling of reassessing and making new goals",
  "i think you are doing everything you can to keep the spirits up!",

  "that's good that you're taking steps to take a step forward. it might help to have some more space to focus on your mental needs.",
  "i hope you can see that your friendship is being seriously taken care of and that you can move on from this",
  "have you considered talking to your friends about how you feel about the situation?",
  "i am glad i was able to help you. i hope that you have a great day and i hope you find a way to get through this",

  "you are very welcome. i hope that you have a wonderful year!",
  "yes i use amazon and they are free",

  "you are the best person to end this mess. i would not feel guilty.",
  "i am sorry to hear that. how is the relationship going?",
  "bye.",
  "i hope everything works out for you.",
  "i understand. i have had friends who would never call me and i felt bad that they didn'ti even call. i just kept trying to work through it. i would also try to think of how to help them in situations like this.",
  "lol, you have a very unique perspective on that. you can still learn new things and learn new ways of writing.",
  "i can see how that can make you feel overwhelmed.",
  "you've got this, you both can work through this.",
  "there are many ways to relax, but it's important to stay positive. you are in a good place to get away from this situation.",
  "it sounds like you have an anxiety disorder and are worried that things will get worse.",
  "i also find that finding a good job is the most important part of being a good person. i have found that with the right environment, i can find a great job. i also found that finding good jobs was the most helpful thing to do during the pandemics.",
  "yes, it can be.",
  "i can understand why parents do not want to have you to be free forever.",
