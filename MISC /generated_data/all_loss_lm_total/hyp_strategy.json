  "i think that's a great idea! you'll have someone to talk to when you have a chance.",
  "i understand how you feel. it has been so hard for me to keep up with the news. it seems that we are all working to get through this, and it'll get easier as we get older.",
  "i think that would be a great first step. perhaps you could try searching online, and if you have any luck there, you can search for support groups online.",

  "hello! how are you?",
  "i am sure that there are a lot of online forumums that are offering counseling or even a counselling service.",
  "i think that's a great idea. i've been doing that too and it's helped me a lot.",
  "i think you should have a job that you could have at home... maybe you could get a new job, maybe you can try looking in other places.",
  "that'll make it easier to move on.",
  "have you tried to talk to your doctor about your anxiety? they can be able to help.",
  "i know that sometimes it can be hard to hear what you are feeling but you are able to reach them out.",
  "i know that it can be difficult to see someone else's feelings, especially when you are in a similar situation.",
  "i can imagine how stressful that would make it.",
  "good!",
  "yes, that is a great idea!",
  "i went on a journey alone once and it was a very nice time.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. i am really sorry to here that you are feeling this way.",
  "i am glad i was able to help you out.",
  "is there anything else i can do for you? i know that i can.",

  "it'll take time to learn to let things go. but don't let him get you down, it'd be easier for you than it would for him to understand your feelings. you have to let him know that you care and it'sn't your fault.",
  "i understand that. i know that is difficult to do, but i have found that i have to find ways to live with myself and my appearance. have you reached out to friends and family to talk about how you feel?",

  "i'm good thanks. what's going on?",
  "i know that it can be hard to find connections in new relationships, but i think there is a way to make a better connection with someone.",

  "ok, please do not be afraid to share your story with me, i hope i was able to be of some help.",

  "no problem! i hope that i have been able to help you and make you feel better.",
  "what is on your mind?",
  "i understand that. i have been in a similar situation before. i had to take medication for my pandemic.",
  "yes, i do excersize. i also excerate myself.",

  "i'm sorry to hear that. i know how frustrating that must be.",

  "i'm glad i could be of some help. keep trying to find a new hobby or do something you enjoy doing.",
  "you are absolutely right. i think that the time to do something will come naturally. it seems like it might help you to get some exercise in a while too.",
  "that'd be a great start, i think. i think you should give it a try!",
  "i understand. i used to worry too. but i learned that the easier the more energy and fresh air i could use, the better my mind would be.",
  "you are welcome. how are you feeling today?",
  "no one has a case like that. it will be a long time before it happens again.",
  "it sounds like you have been stressed about not being able to handle your money well. is that right?",
  "hello",
  "oh no! i am so sorry to hear that. i am glad you are feeling better though.",
  "i think that's a great strategy. do you feel like you have any other questions that you can think of that will be helpful?",
  "i hear you. i find that getting out and walking in the park helps me feel more safe.",
  "i am here to listen!",
  "i think you can try to find some support from a therapist. there are some online resources for getting support from friends.",
  "i understand that feeling too. what would help you to figure out how to find positivity?",

  "well, i am sure you can find something else that would benefit you, even if it isn't the same as what you are doing now.",
  "i know you are trying to help your son, but try not to worry about your son being sick or sick",
  "well, if you are comfortable with the way he is acting then i would suggest talking to him about it.",
  "i know you are worried about being wrong about that but i think you can try your best to keep yourself happy and try to do your best.",
  "how long have you known each other?",
  "have you tried talking to the professor about it?",
  "you should reach into that group and see what they have to say. they can be really helpful.",
  "that's good to hear. it's great to be friends with someone who has been through something like this.",
  "it sounds like you are both really mature about the situation. it sounds as though you have a great plan, and you are doing everything you can to keep the relationship going. it'll be a good thing to see him come back.",

  "i can understand that. i had a similar issue when i was in my teen years. i was not able to get help from my parents because i was worried about my own mental health and drinking. i went to a aa meeting and i had some support from my mom. it was a great meeting and helped me understand my feelings.",

  "well, if he is able to see that it'sn't his problem, i'd suggest that he press the button and see if he'll press it again. if he doesn't, you can always talk to him again and see how it'd help him to see it. that way, you have a good conversation and you can talk to his friends and family about it. i would be surprised if he didn't at first, but i'll bet he doesn ; t feel the same way.",
  "it sounds like you are in a really bad place. i am sorry you are going through this.",
  "i wish you the best of luck.",

  "i know that this has been a really hard time for many people but i know how much you can do if you try. i know you can get through this and be motivated to get through it.",
  "is there any chance that you could talk to your friend about this?",
  "is there something going on?",
  "have you considered talking to a professional to help you get your feelings out?",
  "do you think it is possible that you two could have been friends for a while?",
  "i am sorry to hear that.",
  "i'd be happy to help!",
  "i am doing well. how are things with you? do you feel that you can talk to me?",
  "oh no. is there something specific that has been bothering you?",
  "i can understand how that feels.. sometimes it is hard to tell someone what they are doing and how they are feeling.. i think that it'll be easier to get them to open up.. and then you can move on.",
  "i can understand that, i've been in a similar situation before.",
  "i can understand how that would be frustrating. it sounds like you are trying to solve the problem and it is not working.",
  "that'd be a good idea. i would recommend looking for local support groups that you can join and ask around in the local community.",
  "i feel you there, it is very hard to get a support system when you are having this issue.",
  "how can i help you today?",
  "you are welcome. i am glad i was able to help.",
  "i agree, it'll be hard but everyone will learn the hard way. you've got this!",
  "i have had some friends who have been in that situation and it has made me feel like i can't help myself.",
  "i also was also a man who was always in a better place. i was born with a good heart and a strong temper.",
  "thank you! i hope you have a good rest of your day and keep on writing!",
  "well, i would suggest you try to spend time with friends, family or even a group of people you trust. maybe you can get a bit of some new friends.",
  "have you tried talking to a manager about your concerns about the situation? perhaps you could talk to a supervisor about your feelings about the issue?",
  "how long have you been together?",
  "hi! how are you?",
  "i like to take a walk and watch movies or even just run. it makes me feel better that i'm not alone.",
  "you can try and talk to your coworkmanager about this and see if he can help you out.",
  "i'm glad to hear that. i know it can be a really hard time for you and your family. it sounds like you have been through a lot.",
  "bread pudding sounds good! i am glad you are having a good time with them!",
  "you're welcome! i hope it all works out for you.",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "i can understand that, especially with kids.",
  "i agree!",
  "hello how are you doing?",
  "you are doing well!",
  "it sounds like you are concerned about your child's well being. is that correct?",
  "that is definitely a difficult situation to be in. i think it might be best to just talk to her about it and let her know how much she needs to get her way and why it'd be hard to be alone. i can feel how you are feeling, and i know how it is going to be difficult.",
  "i can understand how that can be stressful.",
  "i've been in a similar situation before. i know how hard it is to move on from a relationship.",
  "that sounds very difficult. it's great that you've reached out for support, though. that is a great thing to do. i am sure you will find someone to reach out to soon.",
  "that's great! it'll help to talk to someone who can help you.",
  "i hear that you are trying to find a job that will benefit you and it'll be a tough one. i'm sure that you will find a great job!",
  "you too!",
  "i have two kids and it's been a rough year for me but i know i can get through this!",
  "i understand you are feeling so helpless and you are going through a stressful time, but you are still trying.",
  "i am sure that you are doing great!",
  "i would try to find a way to make up your mind.",
  "what's going on that is making you feel that way?",
  "i have had to call a tutor and try to understand what i am getting into and that is the biggest hurdle. have you tried talking to him about how he is not being fair to you and that you might need to speak with him again?",
  "have you tried talking to your boss about this?",
  "that is a tough spot to be in. i think you should find a new hobby or hobby that you enjoy.",
  "i can understand that, i have lost my grandmother when i lost my father. i had an amazing family member that was there but the person i was with was the person that was not close to me.",
  "do you have any other ideas?",
  "i used to do it for a living. i did it for about 10 years and it was very difficult.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, how are you?",
  "i can see how that would be stressful. i know it is a struggle to find work in your city right now. have you thought about looking for a local job?",
  "i know that i have suffered from depression as well, it is really hard to get through a difficult time. i do know that you can reach out and express your feelings through text, call a friend, video chat or call a stranger and talk to them about the loss. i am sure they are happy to help you through this.",
  "i understand. that is very difficult. i had to deal with this when i was in college and i know how hard it was.",
  "hi how are you?",
  "that sounds like a lot of pressure. it is very hard to think of situations that are not as important to you as they are to others.",
  "hi, how are you doing today?",
  "i know it is a tough situation to be in right now, but i know that there is a way to solve it.",
  "that sounds really frustrating. i can understand how that must be frustrating.",
  "it sounds like you are feeling really bad about this.",
  "no problem! you are welcome.",
  "it sounds like you are a strong person and you are very mature about what you want to do. i hope that it doesn't take you long to figure out what you are up against.",
  "that is understandable, but if you really need help, you should try to find a support group.",
  "i hear you on that. there are so many opportunities out there that people are trying to get through this tough time. i would suggest trying to make some money on something that will be beneficial for you. i think that is a great idea for you to start looking for a job.",
  "i have a friend who is in the same boat as me, and i think it might also be helpful to start with a few small things that are easy to do with others.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "you're welcome! i hope it will be able to help you feel better.",
  "i would ask them what they think you should do.",
  "it'll probably be good for you to get some help with your grades.",
  "oh i can understand that. i have been in a similar situation where i could not afford to work and was laid out due to covid. i am so sorry that you are going through that.",
  "yes, i have also had this happen with my studies before. i had to study all day before i was able to pass.",
  "do you live with your sister?",
  "i can understand how you are feeling, i have been in a similar situation myself.",
  "i am really glad to hear that. it's been a very rough year for both of us.",
  "no problem!",
  "i understand, i was cheated on once as well and i was not able to get through it",
  "i'm really sorry to hear that. i think it is best to tell her that you are feeling anxious about it. have you talked to her about it?",
  "i am glad you are being kind and being kind to yourself. pampering is a great way to get some fresh air in your day.",
  "i think you should make the most of your time by doing what you want to do. you are doing the right thing.",
  "yes, i do. i'll join a group called the friends group. we're all in the same group and have a group of our own. we always make new friends.",
  "you are not alone",
  "i don't know how many qualifications i have but i am currently working in it. i do know that it's not a bad position to be in, it'll be the next step in the pandemic.",
  "do you have anyone you can talk to about it?",
  "you'll do great!",
  "yes, they will!",
  "it sounds like you are very concerned about your situation and that is understandable",
  "i think that is a great idea.",
  "that does sound like a good idea. i think you could try that!",
  "i understand.",
  "what do you think happened?",
  "that's understandable, sometimes it's better to just ignore the situation and move on with your life. i think you should be proud of your father and that you are doing the right thing.",
  "oh i see. well, i can understand why you are feeling worthless and that you are not good at your job. you should not feel worthless!",
  "what are you looking for?",
  "it'd be great to have a group of people that can help you through this. i think that you can start a new path.",
  "good luck! i hope you find a job soon!",
  "i think it's best to be prepared for all of the situation. i've had a similar situation myself.",
  "hi, i'm so sorry to hear that. what is going on?",
  "thank you. i'd like to hear more about the situation.",
  "i can see how that would be very frustrating.",
  "i totally understand. i have had some pretty bad trauma in my life and i understand how difficult it is.",
  "that sounds like a very difficult situation. i think you should seek professional help.",
  "it seems like you are doing a great job. you are making great money.",
  "what is going on?",
  "i had a friend who was in a similar situation and she started searching for jobs with a lot of positions online.",
  "you should just say so and see what happens.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "i understand. i also have been in the same position before. it took a long time for me to be able to move on from this.",
  "it sounds like you have tried talking with him and that might help with your anxiety.",
  "i have two boys myself. it is a very difficult time for everyone, and it can be overwhelming.",
  "i am very glad to hear that! i hope that i was able to be of some help for you.",
  "have you considered joining a professional counsellor? it can be very helpful to get help and support from people who are going through the same issues.",
  "you're welcome! i wish you all the best with everything!",
  "i can tell you are very intelligent and intelligent, and you know how to do it i had a mentor and she was a great worker.",
  "it sounds like you are having a hard time dealing with your wife.",
  "i would recommend that you take some deep breaths and take a deep breath. it will help you relax.",
  "yes, i am trying my best and am working my best to keep my feelings in perspective.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "you are very welcome, i hope everything goes well for you.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. is there anything specific you'd like to talk about?",
  "what is going on?",
  "i understand. i don't work from home as well.",
  "i think that would be a great place to look. i think it would be worth looking into.",
  "well, there are a few things i would love to do right now... i am in the middle of a job search in the uk, but i am going to look into it later.",
  "you are the one that needs to take control of your life.",
  "you might be surprised at how different people are..",
  "that is very difficult to deal with. can you tell me what causes the problem?",
  "i understand, covid is a terrible thing to happen.",
  "i have experienced this before. it is not easy but i can tell that you are in a better place now.",
  "what kind of things are you doing during holidays?",
  "that'll be difficult for you to deal with, but it's a good thing that you are trying to help her.",
  "you deserve to be treated well. you did the right thing!",
  "i'm doing well, thanks. how are things going for you? what do you think?",
  "i'm feeling very low, but i can't really say why. is it because of the pandemic or a new job?",
  "i know that it'll take time but you can always look for another gig.",
  "i understand how you are going through this. it can be difficult to let your children down when they aren't being ful with their own lives.",
  "i think that you are right, and i think your anger is valid.",
  "i see. so you are saying you are trying to get your work out there but fail to take care of it?",
  "well, i'm sure you could find a solution for yourself. if you don't feel like reaching out, you can always request unemployment. i think that you have the right to do that.",
  "do you feel comfortable playing with others online? you can always chat with your friends and family if you like.",
  "are you still there?",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. i know how hard it can be to lose family.",
  "oh i see, that is a very difficult situation to be in.",
  "you should be able to speak with your uncle, if you do not have any friends or your children, it sounds like it would be beneficial for you to talk to him.",
  "i understand that it is hard to get married. is there a reason you didn't?",
  "have you tried to talk to a therapist?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. that must be very difficult.",
  "i have had similar experiences, and i know that i have been able to recover from them in the short term. however, the long term can be difficult.",

  "maybe you could just look for a job that will be a bit more expensive?",
  "i am sorry to hear that you are feeling this way.",
  "you too",
  "i know it can be hard when you're stressed but you can do it",
  "i think it is okay to be stressed, but don't beat yourself up about it.",
  "it'd be nice to know how it feels to be ignored. have upper management taken any action to address the issue? or is there something else you would like to talk about?",
  "that is a really hard situation to be in right now. have you tried talking to your doctor about it?",
  "i am so sorry. can you tell me what is bothering you?",
  "no problem! i am glad i could help.",
  "do you have any other questions?",
  "i am well, thanks. what happened?",

  "i have had my fair share of problems in the past and this has been a learning experience",
  "yes it is hard to get a job right now, i am sorry you are feeling this way.",
  "i think that is a great idea. maybe if you think about how much you've learned from her, maybe you can start trying new things. i'm sure there are a lot of things you can do to get your self out of this funk.",
  "have you talked to your boss about this?",
  "you are welcome! i hope it helps!",
  "i am sorry to hear that.",
  "it sounds like you are having a hard time dealing with this.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "i've been in the same situation. i was just talking about how i felt last year and it was so stressful! i'd just be anxious and anxious too!",
  "i think that you have a great plan!",
  "i can understand that. i have been in a lot of situations and i have found it to be very stressful.",
  "bye!",
  "no problem! i hope i have been able to help you today!",
  "well, you could try looking online for jobs and see if there is anything you like doing on the internet.",

  "do you have any friends who can help you and your family through your issues?",
  "i think you are going to be able to find a job soon!",
  "so you feel that you are having to get a job, but you don't have to pay for it?",
  "i would just focus on getting your thoughts out in the forest and taking a deep breath. it will help you relax and let you get over the negative feelings.",
  "i have been doing it for a few years now and it helps me a lot.",
  "thanks and best of luck!",
  "that's a hard situation to be in. is he a coworker?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. when did this happen?",
  "it sounds like your heart is in your hands, and you are not alone. you seem to have a great heart for your own that is what makes you stronger.",
  "maybe it'll help to get some of the stress out of your mind",
  "have you thought about looking for new work?",
  "it'll be a bit harder to get started, but it will take time...",
  "i live in new england and have never had a problem with the weather.",

  "that is very understandable, i have been in similar situation where i had to walk away from my family because they did not understand my feelings. i know how hard that can be.",
  "i understand that. i find it helpful to talk to someone who is willing to listen.",
  "if your roommate is not able to stop your roommate from taking your space, then it sounds like you're really not the one who is upset.",
  "i would think that it would be a good idea to find a new job first. it is a tough field to be in, but i think you should at least keep your job.",
  "i can understand how stressful it would be for you to not be able to get him back in time for work.",
  "have you thought about taking some time to think about your friends or family and seeing if you can connect with them?",
  "what do you do for work?",
  "i have also found that if you have money you can make a lot of money while still having the option to drive home",
  "i can understand how that can be very isolating. i had a partner cheat on me once as well.",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "how are you?",
  "you've definitely made the right decision. i think it's great that your friends are willing to be open to the idea. i hope you can find a way to make some friends and make some new friends.",
  "you can also try talking to a therapist about how you are feeling. that way you can have a little more control over how you feel.",
  "i think you'll be fine",
  "it's hard to let things get to you sometimes, but i think you will find something to do to make you happy.",

  "yes i do like reading novels, it helps me to relax and enjoy my time",
  "have you tried talking to your professor?",
  "i can understand that.",
  "i can understand your anxiety. it is very difficult to keep in touch with others when they are having problems with your disability.",
  "i think it would be good to get some suggestions from your boss so you can make a plan for your next step.",
  "do you have any other hobbies or interests that you enjoy?",
  "wow, that is a huge betrayal. you should be ashamed.",
  "yes, try to talk to them as calmly as possible. have them explain that your friend supports trump, but you are not sure if they can see that you are being disrespectful.",
  "i understand that. i was in a relationship with someone who was verbally abusive.",
  "i also have a lot of anxiety about my home situation. it is tough.",
  "that is good that you are trying to help people, and i wish you the best of luck with the rest of your day!",
  "is there anything else i can help you with?",

  "oh no, that's really hard. i can understand how you feel.",
  "i think you should talk to her about how you feel and see how she is feeling and see if you can try to solve it.",
  "have you thought about joining a group or groups to chat with people who are feeling the same way?",
  "i have had to go through this myself. i found a good therapist to help me through it.",
  "hello! how are you doing?",
  "that's good to hear. do you think you can explain to your boss that you are feeling as though you were overlooked, but you're not really, and that your boss is not being honest with you about it?",
  "what is bothering you?",
  "and you don'' t have to worry about being in a relationship with someone if he is leaving you alone.",
  "it sounds like you have a good support system.",
  "it is not for her to know that you are worried about her. i have been in your shoes myself and it was a very difficult time. i know how you are feeling.",
  "i think it'll be great to see your friends again in person!",
  "i am very sorry to hear that, so i understand. i also have a hard time finding a new job.",
  "you too!",
  "i'm so sorry you're having to deal with this, i know how hard it must be.",

  "merry christmas to you too.",
  "well, that's good that you are keeping yourself relaxed.",
  "i know it is hard, but it's okay to be a little sad sometimes!",

  "it sounds like you are having a very hard time finding a counselor to help with your depression. would you consider that?",
  "no problem, i hope that i helped.",
  "i have found that a lot better people just sit down and talk about how they are feeling and how they feel.",
  "i know it's hard, but it will pass. i know that you are trying to make the best of it.",
  "are you having trouble with the tests or are you struggling?",
  "i'll be here, but i need to go. how are you feeling now?",
  "yes, i hope you will find peace soon.",
  "if i remember correctly it is a natural hormone and is not an addicting",
  "i understand that you are feeling down, but i hope you are able to get some help.",
  "you can definitely do it.",
  "yes, i have. i had a long relationship with my ex and i ended it in a week. it was really hard and i was so sad.",
  "do you have any other children that could possibly help him?",
  "i can understand why that would be so frustrating, especially when it is your grandson.",
