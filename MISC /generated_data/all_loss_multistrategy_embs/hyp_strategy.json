  "how long were you together?",
  "it'll help you to get your head out of your chest.",
  "it seems like you have a lot going on. i am sure you are not alone.",
  "i understand that. and i also think that being broke is not the end of the world. it takes a lot to become a king!!! - d!!",
  "i'm good, how has it been going?",
  "good afternoon, how are you doing today?",
  "that's true. i've been in a similar situation myself. it's tough but i'll take care of myself.",
  "the best thing you can do is try to talk to a supervisor about the situation.",
  "it sounds to me that you are struggling with finding a job right now, which is a good thing.",

  "i've been through a breakup as well and i know how painful it can be. what did you give her?",
  "hello, how are you?",
  "yes, that is a great idea",
  "you are absolutely right about that. i also believe that anyone can learn new things. what about something you can learn in school that you really enjoy doing?",

  "there are lots of people out there who will be willing to listen.",
  "you're welcome! i hope that you feel better soon!",

  "i am doing well, thank you. what is going on with you? how is life treating you today?",
  "it'd be great if you could discuss this with him. it'll help him to know how to communicate better and not feel so stuck in the way that he is.",
  "he has a job too, so maybe you should talk to him about this.",
  "so you feel like they did something wrong and they just pulled out the excuse on everyone else?",
  "i know, i'm a very shy person. it'll take some time to adjust to the situation.",
  "i am glad you are feeling better!",
  "i understand, i am sorry.",
  "i had to start with explaining why i was being intrussive and explain why i felt that way. the rest is really about the situation.",
  "i know its not for everyone. i have had to deal with the same things before. it is really hard to get through a relationship when you are in such a tough time.",
  "you are welcome!",
  "i totally understand where you've coming from. i have had to make sure to take breaks from studying for a while, and it's hard when you'll be working so hard!",

  "it's good that you're aware of this and are concerned about the situation.",
  "that is a very understandable feeling, especially in the beginning of the year. what are some things that you'd like to do for yourself?",
  "do you think you could talk to him about it?",
  "it sounds like you have a lot of responsibility on your part. have you tried to explain to your boss that your boss is taking advantage of you?",

  "it sounds as if you are doing great work. i think you are taking steps forward.",
  "yes, it sounds like taking less time outside of your work has really helped you.",
  "have you tried to talk to them about their feelings?",
  "i think that's a great way to spend time! it's great that you have the tools to get out and do your job. i think you'll find a way to stay away from the news, even though it'll be hard to keep up with it.",
  "i am glad i was able to help you",
  "i am sure you will get caught soon, just remember, in the end it'll be all over!",

  "i am in fl aswell",
  "how are you?",
  "i think it might be a good idea to ask them another time to see what their excuse was",
  "true : ). and i think that the circle is pretty good!",
  "i'd definitely suggest taking some time for yourself. it can be a good way to relax and be able to focus on your own issues.",
  "i'll be honest, i don't think so. i've had a lot of trouble with my self esteem in the past.",
  "well, i live in the country so i see that as a possibility. i live near a lot of nature parks and nature trails.",
  "i know you said you were let go but you can apply again and see if you get approved",
  "what do you think happened?",
  "you can talk to him about this and see if he likes you more.",
  "i understand, that's very true. it'll be hard to find another job if you don'; t have a good one. maybe you could try looking for another job that pays less than your previous one, and maybe even better?",

  "i understand your concern, but you can also try applying for online jobs that enable you a better understanding of what you are looking for and the options you will get.",
  "that'll make it hard when you are laid off, but if you are able to talk to a friend and say you are not sure then you can talk to them and see if there is anything you can do to help them.",
  "have you tried speaking to your boss about your concerns?",
  "ok. well, you have a good day.",
  "i think you should talk to your friends and see what they think about that. if you feel like they are not interested in you, just move on.",

  "i hope you feel better soon!",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. have you been having trouble sleeping at all?",
  "we can't wait to get our house ready, but we have been trying to make it work and now we have a house to help the kids",
  "hi, how are you doing today?",
  "have you tried any other forms of physical activity to help you sleep?",
  "i think that you are not alone in feeling this way. you need to be able to accept that it is happening and move forward.",

  "i think that is a good idea, you should try to take some deep breaths and think about your own health.",
  "hello",
  "i think it'll be hard for you to find a new therapist when you get older, but if you've already gotten through this, i'd recommend asking your local local mental health professional. i've had a lot of problems with therapy and it'd be helpful to reach out to someone that knows what they've been through.",

  "hello, how are you doing today?",
  "you'll get through this, i am sure!",
  "i understand that. i think that some people are more interested in helping others than they are in helping themselves. i also think that the best thing to do is to give yourself time to relax, take care of yourself and just let it out. you have to be careful about that, though, as it can make you feel like you've lost something in the pandemic.",

  "have you had any conversations about it with him or her?",
  "do you think it's possible for them to see you as a person who isn't supporting trump?",
  "that is very bad.",
  "have you thought about having a journal that you can journal and just write down all the things you are feeling stressed about?",
  "i have been there myself.. it was very difficult but it was a good thing to get help",
  "ah, that does sound very difficult.",
  "i see, so you feel that they dislike you in some way, but you don't want to tell them that you don t like them?",
  "you're welcome. i wish you all the best in the future.",

  "i am sorry to hear that. can you tell me more about it?",
  "you too",
  "i think you should try meditation",
  "i hope i have been able to be of some help.",

  "do you have any other friends that you can talk to about it?",
  "it seems like you have a lot going on at the moment, and i think you're doing great!",
  "i can see how this would make you feel very anxious. you should try to have a serious talk with him about how you are feeling. it is really important to talk to him about what he is experiencing and how it affects your life.",
  "no problem, i hope that things go well for you guys.",
  "i have had to deal with the same thing myself and it is very difficult to move on and move on. it's hard to put things into perspective.",
